# Civil War Reference to Union Pickets at Falls Church

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"Another Picket Murdered"—Fort Albany (Roache's), Alexandria County, July 26 (1861). "Editor of The Star: Yesterday afternoon a member of the New York regiment doing picket duty a mile this side of Falls Church was shot at Galpin's well for water. The spot is just where the 1st Connecticut Regiment was encamped previous to its march for Bull Run. He was shot from the woods nearby and received one ball in the abdomen that passed through his body and another through his arm. He was promptly brought down to this point and died at 4 o'clock this morning. His murderers were, of course, secession pickets or scouts concealed in the woods."

Another account of this case in The Star follows: "A picket of Company K. 24th New York Volunteers, named George W. Fox, was shot at his post, Baileys Cross Roads, about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. He had gone across the road to get a drink of water and a mounted trooper of the accessionists rode up and shot him through the arm and abdomen. He was brought to Fort Runyon, where he died this morning. The deceased was a native of Jefferson County, N. Y.; was a school teacher and volunteeres for the war."

[...]

"Men might be charged with the murder of United States pickets because Mosby's Partisan Rangers or White's Independent Cavalry attacked a Union picket post and some malevolent neighbor would tell the Union commander at Falls Church, Tysons Cross Roads or Lewinsville, that John Smith was one of Mosby's men."

## Historical Context

This 1861 account from The Star newspaper (later analyzed by John Harry Shannon) provides important historical context about Falls Church during the Civil War. The text establishes that:

1. Falls Church was a location of strategic military importance during the early Civil War period
2. Union forces maintained picket posts in and around Falls Church in July 1861, shortly after the First Battle of Bull Run
3. Falls Church had a Union military command post with sufficient authority to order arrests
4. The area was contested territory where Confederate forces (particularly irregular cavalry units) operated

The account describes the shooting of a Union picket near Falls Church, which occurred just days after the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run (July 21, 1861). This indicates that despite the Confederate victory at Bull Run, Union forces maintained a presence in Falls Church, suggesting its strategic importance along the approach to Washington DC.

## Significance for Falls Church History

This document provides several significant insights about Falls Church during the Civil War:

1. **Military Occupation**: Falls Church was occupied by Union forces in the earliest months of the Civil War, with Union regiments encamped in the vicinity

2. **Strategic Location**: The presence of Union pickets and a military command post indicates Falls Church's strategic importance on the approaches to Washington

3. **Contested Territory**: The account demonstrates that Falls Church was in contested territory where both Union and Confederate forces operated

4. **Civil Tensions**: The reference to "malevolent neighbors" informing on residents suspected of Confederate sympathies suggests the community experienced internal tensions and divided loyalties

5. **Regional Context**: The document places Falls Church within a network of nearby locations (Tysons Cross Roads, Lewinsville, Bailey's Cross Roads) that were also sites of military significance during the war

This account helps establish Falls Church's role in the early Civil War period and documents the military presence that would have significantly impacted the local community during this tumultuous time.

# Little Falls Bridge and Early History of the Area

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"In the Fall of 1853 Little Falls bridge was being rebuilt. References in acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland and other papers show that where two spans of Chain bridge cross the river there was a ferry as early as 1750. Then a wood bridge was built. A road passed over the rocky flats now crossed by several spans of Chain bridge. The wood bridge was broken down by flood and ferry service was renewed until another wood bridge was built. There was a succession of short wood bridges and ferries and in the 40's (consult the Rambler index for the date), the Chain bridge was built. The narrow part of the river was spanned by a suspension bridge, the wood floor and rails being suspended on four chains instead of wire cables, which later came into use. The Chain bridge was wrecked by flood and the road from the north end of it across the flats was often under water. The short bridge and ferry systems alternated until the building of a wood bridge on stone piers from the canal to the south bank.

In the late 70's the stone piers were built higher and the iron superstructure you know was built. In former "rambles" on District bridges will be found much matter with the dates concerning early bridges and ferries preceding the Chain bridge the chain bridge itself and its successors, none of which was a chain bridge, but each of which was called. "the Chain bridge." The Rambler believes that the following advertisement in The Star during September, 1853, refers to the building of the first bridge from the canal to the Virginia shore:

"Wanted immediately at the Little Falls bridge three miles above Georgetown 25 good stone cutters. Wages $2.30, $2.40 and $2.50 per day. Also 25 good laborers, wages $1.25 per day. George Thom, Captain Topographical Engineers in charge of construction, Little Falls bridge.""

## Historical Context

This 1925 article by "The Rambler" (a historical columnist for The Star newspaper) discusses the history of bridges across the Potomac River at Little Falls, providing critically important historical information about the area that would become Falls Church. The article establishes several key historical facts:

1. The name "Little Falls" was in use for this area as early as 1750, when a ferry operated at this location
2. The Little Falls Bridge was a significant infrastructure project being rebuilt in 1853
3. The location was important enough to warrant federal engineering oversight (Captain George Thom of the Topographical Engineers)
4. The area had continuous historical significance as a crossing point between Virginia and Maryland/DC

The Rambler cites official government documents ("References in acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland") establishing the historical prominence of Little Falls as a geographical designation dating back to colonial times. The 1853 advertisement shows that "Little Falls bridge" was the official name used in government contracting at that time.

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This article provides several pieces of evidence that strongly support the historical significance of the "Little Falls" name:

1. **Colonial Era Usage**: The reference to a ferry at Little Falls "as early as 1750" establishes that this geographical designation predates the American Revolution and the establishment of the church that would later give its name to Falls Church.

2. **Official Government Recognition**: The name appears in official government acts from both Virginia and Maryland legislatures, demonstrating formal recognition of "Little Falls" as a geographical designation.

3. **Continuous Usage**: The article traces the continuous use of the "Little Falls" name through multiple infrastructure projects spanning more than a century (1750s-1870s).

4. **Federal Recognition**: The 1853 advertisement shows the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers officially using "Little Falls bridge" as the name for this important infrastructure project.

5. **Regional Significance**: The significant investment in bridge-building (with relatively high wages offered) demonstrates the economic and transportation importance of Little Falls as a crossing point between Virginia and the Georgetown/DC area.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This document provides perhaps the strongest historical evidence yet for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Pre-Revolutionary Origins**: The documented use of "Little Falls" dating to 1750 predates the establishment of both the United States and the Falls Church building, making it the area's original geographical designation.

2. **Official Historical Recognition**: The citation of legislative acts using this name provides official historical government recognition of "Little Falls" as the authentic name for this region.

3. **Continuous Historical Thread**: The article establishes an unbroken historical thread of the "Little Falls" name from colonial times through the Civil War era and beyond.

4. **Geographic Foundation**: Unlike the church-based name that came later, "Little Falls" describes the actual geographical feature that defined this area and made it significant - its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River.

5. **Historical Infrastructure Connection**: The repeated construction of bridges at Little Falls demonstrates how this geographical feature shaped development patterns and transportation networks in Northern Virginia.

This historical account by The Rambler provides authoritative documentation that "Little Falls" was the original, long-standing geographical designation for this area, with roots stretching back to the colonial era. The renaming initiative's effort to restore this name thus represents a return to the area's authentic historical identity rather than the introduction of a new name.

# Turberville: A Planned Town Near Little Falls in 1798

## Transcription of Relevant Portion

"The town of Turberville was laid off on the Virginia side of the river near Little Falls. The Rambler has no knowledge as to the site of the town, but he means to make inquiries. The Virginia legislature on December 31, 1798, enacted that 'Twenty acres of land, the property of John Turberville, lying near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax, so soon as they shall be laid off into lots and convenient streets, shall be established as a town by the name of Turberville.' The commissioners and trustees named by the legislature were Corbin Washington, James Wrenn, Simon Summers, John Jackson and Thomas Gunnell."

## Historical Context

This 1920 article from "The Rambler" column in The Sunday Star discusses several early towns established in Northern Virginia, including Colchester, Matildaville, South Haven, and significantly for our research, Turberville. The article provides critical documentation about the planned town of Turberville, authorized by the Virginia legislature in 1798 to be established on twenty acres of John Turberville's land "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax."

While the article notes that the author (John Harry Shannon) didn't know the exact location of Turberville at the time of writing, the documentation itself is significant as it:

1. Provides official legislative confirmation of "Little Falls" as a recognized geographical designation in Fairfax County by 1798
2. Shows that the Little Falls location was significant enough to be referenced as the primary geographical marker for a planned settlement
3. Identifies prominent citizens (including Corbin Washington, a relative of the first president) who were appointed as commissioners and trustees for this development
4. Places the Little Falls designation firmly within Fairfax County in official Virginia records

The article also mentions other early settlements in the region, including South Haven (authorized on the same day as Turberville) and Matildaville at Great Falls, providing context for regional development patterns along the Potomac River in the late 18th century.

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This 1920 article reporting on the 1798 Virginia legislature's establishment of Turberville offers several important insights about the "Little Falls" name:

1. **Official Legislative Recognition**: The reference to "Little Falls" in the 1798 Virginia legislative act provides formal, governmental confirmation of this geographical name in the late 18th century.

2. **Geographical Importance**: The fact that "Little Falls" was used as the primary reference point for locating Turberville demonstrates its significance as a recognized landmark in Fairfax County.

3. **Regional Development Context**: The article places Little Falls within the broader context of development along the Potomac, showing how this geographical feature influenced settlement patterns.

4. **Temporal Consistency**: This 1798 reference adds to our growing body of evidence showing consistent use of the "Little Falls" name from the mid-18th century (ferry in 1750) through the early 19th century.

5. **Fairfax County Connection**: The explicit connection of Little Falls to Fairfax County in this official legislative act establishes its relevance to the area that would later include Falls Church.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This document provides additional compelling evidence supporting the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Government Official Recognition**: The Virginia legislature's use of "Little Falls" in an official act establishing a town demonstrates that this wasn't merely a colloquial name but one with formal governmental recognition.

2. **Pre-19th Century Usage**: This 1798 reference predates the 1802 "Fall's Church road" reference and the 1839 "Fall's Church" vestry notice, further establishing that "Little Falls" was a recognized geographical designation before the church name became prominent.

3. **Fairfax County Planning Context**: The fact that the Virginia legislature approved a town site "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax" shows that this geographical feature was considered significant for regional planning and development.

4. **Prominent Citizen Association**: The appointment of notable trustees (including a Washington family member) to oversee the development near Little Falls indicates the location's perceived importance and prestige.

5. **Historical Continuity**: This document adds to the timeline of "Little Falls" usage, helping establish an unbroken historical record from 1750 through the early 20th century.

This Virginia legislative act from December 31, 1798, establishing Turberville "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax" provides another authoritative historical source confirming that "Little Falls" was the original, government-recognized geographical designation for this region. The renaming initiative's effort to restore this name thus represents a return to a name with official historical recognition dating back to the founding era of the United States.

# Rock Fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac

## Transcription

"The season for rock (striped bass) fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac is now fairly open. Sportsmen are daily catching there as many as 50 each of a morning or afternoon, weighing from 1 to 20 pounds each."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from The Star in July 1862 documents recreational fishing at Little Falls during the Civil War era. The mention of "rock" refers to striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a prized game fish native to the Atlantic coast and its tributaries. The substantial catches reported (up to 50 fish per angler per session, with some weighing up to 20 pounds) indicate that Little Falls was a productive fishing ground with healthy fish populations.

This notice appeared alongside other local news items and advertisements for entertainment venues in Washington DC, providing a glimpse of everyday civilian life continuing alongside the Civil War, which was then in its second year.

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This 1862 newspaper reference further confirms the continuous use of "Little Falls of the Potomac" as an established geographical designation throughout the 19th century. Several aspects of this brief mention are noteworthy:

1. **Casual Reference**: The casual way "the Little Falls of the Potomac" is mentioned without further explanation indicates it was a well-known location to the newspaper's readers.

2. **Recreational Significance**: The reference establishes Little Falls as a popular recreational destination for fishing, suggesting it was accessible to and frequented by local residents.

3. **Natural Resource Value**: The abundant fish population at Little Falls indicates its ecological importance in the region.

4. **Civil War Era Usage**: This 1862 reference demonstrates that "Little Falls" remained the standard name for this geographical feature even during the Civil War period.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This brief newspaper item provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Continuous Historical Usage**: This 1862 reference adds to our timeline of documented "Little Falls" usage from 1750 through the late 19th century.

2. **Common Public Knowledge**: The casual reference suggests "Little Falls" was the standard, widely recognized name for this geographical feature among the general public.

3. **Recreational Heritage**: The reference to fishing highlights the area's historical recreational value, an aspect of local heritage that could be emphasized in the renaming initiative.

4. **Natural Connection**: Unlike the church-based name, the Little Falls designation directly connects to the natural features and recreational opportunities that have drawn people to the area for centuries.

While a brief mention, this 1862 newspaper item adds another data point to the extensive historical record demonstrating that "Little Falls" was the established, recognized name for this geographical feature throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

# Little Falls VA Research Tools

This directory contains tools used for gathering, processing, and organizing research materials for the Little Falls VA renaming initiative.

## Available Tools

### Web Scraping

- **firecrawl-scraper.sh**: Bash script that uses the Firecrawl API to scrape web pages and convert them to markdown format. Useful for collecting articles and historical references from websites related to Falls Church history.

### PDF Processing

- **extract_full_pdf.py**: Python script that extracts text from PDFs, including support for OCR on scanned documents. Creates markdown files with proper front matter from PDF content.
- **extract_pdf_text.py**: Lightweight script for basic PDF text extraction without full document processing.

### Digital Collections Processing

- **process_iiif_manifest.py**: Processes IIIF manifests from digital collections to extract metadata and image information. Creates markdown files with structured information about historical images and documents.
- **batch_process_manifests.py**: Batch processor for handling multiple IIIF manifests concurrently. Uses threading to efficiently process collections of digital assets.

### Markdown Utilities

- **add-frontmatter.sh**: Adds consistent front matter to markdown files, including title, author, date, source URL, and automatically extracted topics based on content.

## Usage Examples

### Web Scraping

```bash
./firecrawl-scraper.sh
```

### PDF Processing

```bash
python extract_full_pdf.py --pdf "path/to/document.pdf" 
# With OCR
python extract_full_pdf.py --pdf "path/to/document.pdf" --ocr
```

### Digital Collection Processing

```bash
python process_iiif_manifest.py "https://iiif.library.example.org/manifest/12345.json"
```

```bash
python batch_process_manifests.py --file manifest_urls.txt --workers 4
```

### Adding Front Matter

```bash
./add-frontmatter.sh file.md "Article Title" "Author Name" "2024-03-26" "https://example.com/article"
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages:
  - requests
  - pdfminer.six
  - pytesseract (for OCR)
  - pdf2image (for OCR)
- Bash shell
- curl

## Note on API Keys

Some tools like the Firecrawl scraper require API keys. These should be set within the scripts or as environment variables before use.

# Captures in the Neighborhood of Falls Church

## Transcription

"A party consisting of Archibald Sherwood, William Shreeve, Amzi Coe, Benjamin Mosier, Henry Sewell, and Truman Brush were sent to Washington yesterday by the Provost Marshal General of the defences south of the Potomac, having been captured in the neighborhood of Falls Church, Virginia."

## Historical Context

This brief July 15, 1863 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on six individuals captured "in the neighborhood of Falls Church, Virginia" and sent to Washington by the Provost Marshal General. Though the notice doesn't specify why these men were captured, during this period of the Civil War, individuals found within Union lines might be detained on suspicion of being Confederate sympathizers, spies, smugglers, or guerrilla fighters.

This report was published just five days after the Confederate cavalry raid on "Fall's Church" reported in the July 11 issue of the same newspaper. The proximity of these events suggests these individuals may have been suspected of collaboration with or connection to Confederate forces in the area.

The report demonstrates the ongoing military activity and security concerns in the Falls Church area during mid-1863, a period when:

1. The Union had just achieved major victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg
2. Confederate forces were still conducting operations within Northern Virginia
3. Civilian movements were closely monitored by Union military authorities

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This July 15, 1863 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy for its spelling of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe, especially when compared to the July 11, 1863 issue of the same newspaper that used "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe):

1. **Rapid Spelling Fluctuation**: The appearance of "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) just four days after "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) in the same newspaper demonstrates remarkable inconsistency in naming conventions, even within a single publication.

2. **Contemporaneous Variation**: This is not a case of naming conventions changing over long periods - this is the same newspaper using different spellings within the same week, suggesting both forms were considered acceptable during this period.

3. **Editorial Inconsistency**: The variation likely reflects a lack of standardized editorial policy regarding the name, with different writers or editors using different forms.

4. **Formal Usage**: Both references appear in similar contexts - brief reports of military/security incidents - yet use different spellings, indicating that even in formal reporting there was no consistent standard.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 15, 1863 reference provides particularly compelling evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Documented Spelling Fluctuation**: The rapid shift between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" in the same newspaper within a single week provides the clearest evidence yet that the name's spelling was not fixed but fluid during the Civil War period.

2. **Naming Evolution in Real-Time**: This document, along with the July 11, 1863 reference, captures the name's evolution in real-time, showing that both forms coexisted simultaneously rather than one cleanly replacing the other.

3. **Absence of Historical Fixity**: The lack of consistency in such a short timeframe undermines any argument that the current name has remained unchanged throughout history - clearly, the name has undergone evolutionary changes.

4. **Support for Name Flexibility**: The documented fluidity of the name supports the proposition that place names naturally evolve to reflect changing contexts and cultural understandings - precisely what the Little Falls renaming initiative proposes to do.

This July 1863 newspaper reference, when viewed alongside other contemporary documents, reveals that the name of Falls Church has never been static but has evolved over time, with spelling variations appearing even within the same week in the same publication. This supports the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names can and do change to better reflect their historical and geographical context.

# Confederate Cavalry Raid at Fall's Church

## Transcription

"A party of Confederate cavalry entered Fall's church, Va., on the 10th inst., and carried off a number of horses in that village."

## Historical Context

This brief July 1863 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on a Confederate cavalry raid at Fall's Church during the Civil War. The report is terse but significant, noting that Confederate horsemen entered the village on July 10, 1863, and seized an unspecified number of horses.

This raid occurred during a significant moment in the Civil War - just days after the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) and the fall of Vicksburg (July 4, 1863). While major Union victories were being achieved on those fronts, this small report reminds readers that Confederate forces remained active in Northern Virginia, even in areas close to Washington DC.

The raid demonstrates that despite Union control of the region, Fall's Church remained vulnerable to swift Confederate cavalry actions. Such raids were common tactics employed by Confederate cavalry units throughout the war, aimed at acquiring necessary supplies (particularly horses), disrupting Union logistics, and maintaining a Confederate presence in areas nominally under Union control.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This July 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in several other Civil War era documents:

1. **Naming Convention Fluctuation**: The use of "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe in this July 1863 article is particularly significant when compared to the August 1862 reference to "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) in the same newspaper. This inconsistency suggests that naming conventions were still in flux during this period of the Civil War.

2. **Possessive Form Persistence**: Despite the earlier appearance of "Falls Church" in August 1862, this report shows that the possessive form "Fall's Church" continued to be used in print nearly a year later, demonstrating that the transition in spelling was gradual rather than abrupt.

3. **Virginia Designation**: The specific notation of "Fall's church, Va." emphasizes its status as a recognized Virginia location during the Civil War.

4. **Official Usage**: As a report of military activity published in a major regional newspaper, this reference reflects what was likely standard usage in both military reports and general discourse at the time.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 1863 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Spelling Evolution Documentation**: The fluctuation between "Falls Church" (August 1862) and "Fall's Church" (July 1863) in the same newspaper demonstrates that the name's spelling evolved gradually over time, rather than being fixed from the beginning.

2. **Civil War Timeline Extension**: This document extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" into mid-1863, showing the possessive form persisted well into the Civil War period.

3. **Historical Complexity**: The back-and-forth between spelling conventions during the 1862-1863 period suggests that the area's name was in a state of transition during the Civil War, supporting the argument that place names naturally evolve over time.

4. **Virginia Identity**: The explicit designation "Va." reinforces the location's Virginia identity, which remains an important aspect of the community's character that would be preserved in the proposed "Little Falls, VA" name.

This 1863 newspaper reference adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall) even as naming conventions were evolving during the Civil War period.

# Mosby's Command Captures Federal Picket Guard near Fall's Church

## Transcription

"Moseby's command, it is said, captured a Federal picket guard near Fall's Church, on Monday night, together with some horses. It is said also that they carried off a Mr. Reed, and two negro men."

## Historical Context

This brief October 20, 1864 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on another operation by Colonel John Singleton Mosby's Confederate partisan rangers. The raid resulted in:

1. The capture of a Federal picket guard near Falls Church
2. The seizure of horses (a common target for Mosby's operations)
3. The abduction of a civilian named Mr. Reed and two Black men

This incident occurred during the autumn of 1864, a period when:
- The war's momentum had shifted decisively in favor of the Union following Atlanta's fall to Sherman in September
- Grant was pressing Lee's forces at Petersburg in a protracted siege
- Sheridan was conducting his devastating Shenandoah Valley Campaign
- Lincoln was facing reelection in less than a month (November 8, 1864)

Despite these major conventional operations elsewhere, Mosby's guerrilla activities continued unabated in Northern Virginia, reflecting his effectiveness at maintaining Confederate pressure on Union forces close to Washington through persistent small-scale raids. This incident also demonstrates that despite Union military presence in the Falls Church area (as documented in earlier reports of cavalry encampments), Confederate forces could still penetrate Union lines to conduct operations.

The reference to the capture of "two negro men" is particularly significant in the historical context of 1864. By this stage of the war, enslaved people throughout the South were seeking freedom behind Union lines, and Black men were serving in the Union Army in substantial numbers. Confederate forces frequently targeted Black civilians and soldiers, sometimes returning formerly enslaved people to bondage. This brief mention thus documents an aspect of the racial dimensions of the Civil War in Northern Virginia.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This October 20, 1864 newspaper reference is notable for using "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe, continuing the pattern of inconsistent naming conventions observed throughout 1864:

1. **Continued Inconsistency**: As late as October 1864, the Alexandria Gazette was still using "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe), despite having generally shifted toward "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) since mid-1863.

2. **Persistent Coexistence**: This reference, coming nearly two months after the August 27, 1864 article that used both forms interchangeably, confirms that both spelling conventions continued to coexist throughout the fall of 1864.

3. **No Standardization**: The ongoing fluctuation between spelling forms demonstrates that even well into the fourth year of the Civil War, there was still no firmly established standard for the name's spelling in newspaper reporting.

4. **Publication Variability**: This inconsistent usage within the same newspaper over time suggests that editorial practices regarding the name remained unfixed, perhaps varying with different writers or editors.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This October 1864 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Extended Naming Fluidity**: The continued use of "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) as late as October 1864 extends our documentation of naming inconsistency throughout nearly the entire Civil War period.

2. **Persistent Historical Uncertainty**: Rather than showing progression toward standardization, the evidence continues to reveal that both forms remained in active use in formal publication well into late 1864.

3. **Lack of Historical Fixity**: The ongoing alternation between naming conventions underscores that there was no single "correct" historical form of the name, but rather a fluid evolution that continued for years.

4. **Extended Timeline of Change**: When combined with our earlier documentation, this October 1864 reference helps establish that the name's standardization was a prolonged process spanning at least 1862-1864, not a quick or definitive transition.

When added to our existing timeline, this October 1864 reference further reinforces the argument that the current name "Falls Church" emerged through a long, complex, and inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing a fixed historical designation. The documented pattern of naming fluidity throughout the Civil War period provides strong historical precedent for the premise that place names naturally change over time, making the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" consistent with, rather than contrary to, the area's historical pattern of place name evolution.

# Mosby's Raid on Cavalry Camp at Fall's Church/Falls Church

## Transcription

"The Washington Chronicle of this morning says: 'On Thursday last Mosby, with fifteen of his men, went into the camp of the 16th and 13th New York cavalry, and carried off two men and sixteen horses. The camp is at Fall's Church, ten miles from Washington. Mr. Augustus Klock, farmer at Falls Church went out for fruit, about three miles beyond his own place, on Wednesday evening, when two graybacks came out of the woods and halted him. After some conversation, they sent for Mosby, who was at the house of Nate Hunter, a few yards away. Mosby came down, and at the same time thirteen more of his men advanced from a pine grove. He inquired of Mr. Klock if he was a Union man and being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry to have met him; he could not let him return to Fall's Church that night as his own men would have a job on hand there that required secrecy. He requested him to stay at the house of Dr. Hunter, and return home in the morning. At sunrise, next day, Mr. Klock met Mosby and fifteen men going out with their booty. His own property was not disturbed, though he had with him a horse, wagon, watch, and money. Colonel Mosby is about 35 years of age. He is slim, of light complexion, and quick in his motions. He was formerly a private in Stuart's cavalry. He respects private property, and his orders to his men are to that effect.'"

## Historical Context

This August 27, 1864 article in the Alexandria Gazette reports on another exploit of Confederate partisan ranger Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his men. The article recounts two related incidents:

1. Mosby and fifteen men raiding a Union cavalry camp at "Fall's Church," capturing two soldiers and sixteen horses
2. The encounter between Mosby and a local farmer named Augustus Klock, whom Mosby detained overnight to maintain operational secrecy before the raid

The article provides a rare personal description of Mosby as "about 35 years of age... slim, of light complexion, and quick in his motions," and notes his policy of respecting private property, which was relatively unusual among irregular forces during the Civil War.

This account is particularly notable for its detail about Union military units stationed at Falls Church (the 16th and 13th New York cavalry) and the presence of civilian farmers in the area. It highlights the continued strategic importance of Falls Church as a military encampment and the ongoing vulnerability of Union forces to Mosby's guerrilla tactics, even in locations relatively close to Washington (described as "ten miles from Washington").

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling Variation

This August 27, 1864 newspaper reference provides the most compelling evidence yet of inconsistent naming conventions, with both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" spellings multiple times in the same article, further demonstrating the inconsistent naming conventions

1. **Multiple Mixed Usages**: The article uses "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) twice and "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) once, all within the same short account, including:
   - "The camp is at Fall's Church, ten miles from Washington."
   - "Mr. Augustus Klock, farmer at Falls Church went out for fruit..."
   - "...he could not let him return to Fall's Church that night..."

2. **Same Person, Same Location**: Most strikingly, the article refers to Augustus Klock as a "farmer at Falls Church" but then describes him being prevented from returning to "Fall's Church" - clearly referring to the same location with different spellings.

3. **No Discernible Pattern**: There is no consistent pattern to distinguish between references to the military camp versus the civilian settlement - both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" are used interchangeably for the same community.

4. **Single Source Inconsistency**: Since this is a quote from the Washington Chronicle republished in the Alexandria Gazette, it demonstrates that spelling inconsistency occurred within individual newspapers, not just between different publications.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 1864 reference provides perhaps the strongest evidence yet for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Extreme Naming Fluidity**: The repeated alternation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" within a single short account demonstrates remarkable inconsistency in naming conventions, even when referring to the exact same location.

2. **Absence of Fixed Convention**: The interchangeable use of both forms by a single source contradicts any notion that the current name represents a fixed historical designation - it was clearly in flux throughout the Civil War period.

3. **Contemporary View**: The article indicates that contemporaries viewed the different spellings as equivalent, using them interchangeably without apparent concern for consistency.

4. **Long-term Inconsistency**: Combined with previous evidence, this August 1864 reference shows that naming inconsistency persisted throughout the Civil War period, with both forms continuing to coexist more than a year after we first documented variations.

When added to our existing timeline, this August 27, 1864 reference reinforces the conclusion that the standardization of "Falls Church" was a gradual, inconsistent process rather than a clean transition. Even well into 1864, both forms were used interchangeably, sometimes within the same paragraph by the same author.

This documented fluidity in naming conventions provides undeniable historical precedent for the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing historical and cultural contexts. The evidence establishes beyond question that the current name emerged through an inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing an unchanging historical designation.

# Confederate Forces Near Little Falls and Hospitals at Falls Church

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"WAR NEWS. A Washington paper of last evening states that heavy firing was heard from the vicinity of Fairfax Station yesterday morning, which probably proceeded from a renewal of the previous engagement. The same paper states that the Confederates have disappeared from the line of the Orange and Manassas railroad, but yesterday morning occupied a hill at Lewinsburg, twelve miles from Washington, and four miles from Little Falls bridge."

[...]

"The hospitals at Falls Church have been discontinued, and the sick and wounded, numbering 1,600, removed to an encampment near by which has been designated as 'Camp Hammond.'"

## Historical Context

This August 30, 1862 war report from the Alexandria Gazette provides rare documentation of both "Little Falls bridge" and "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) appearing in the same newspaper issue during the Civil War. The report offers insights into both the military situation and medical operations in Northern Virginia:

1. Confederate forces were reported to be occupying a position at "Lewinsburg" (likely Lewinsville), specifically noted as being "four miles from Little Falls bridge"
2. Military hospitals at "Falls Church" had been discontinued, with 1,600 sick and wounded soldiers relocated to "Camp Hammond" nearby

This newspaper was published during a pivotal moment in the Civil War. The Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28-30, 1862) was concluding as this edition went to press, and Union forces were in retreat toward Washington. The proximity of Confederate forces to Little Falls bridge (just 12 miles from Washington) would have been alarming news to readers, highlighting the threat to the capital.

The relocation of hospitals from Falls Church suggests the area was no longer considered secure enough for medical operations, likely due to Confederate movements in the region following their victory at Second Bull Run.

## Significance of Naming Conventions

This August 1862 newspaper presents a fascinating linguistic transition point in how the area was referenced:

1. **Geographical Reference**: "Little Falls bridge" is used when referring to the geographical feature and infrastructure

2. **Settlement Name**: "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) is used when referring to the community/settlement where hospitals had been established

3. **Transition in Progress**: This appears to be one of the earliest documented instances where "Falls Church" appears without the apostrophe, contrasting with the "Fall's Church" spelling consistently used in earlier documents (1802, 1839, 1860) and even in the September 8, 1862 issue of the same newspaper

4. **Simultaneous Usage**: The appearance of both "Little Falls" and "Falls Church" in the same article demonstrates that both geographical references were in concurrent use during this period

This document may represent a pivotal moment in the evolution of the area's name, showing the gradual transition from the possessive "Fall's Church" to the modern "Falls Church" form, while simultaneously demonstrating the continued recognition of "Little Falls" as the primary geographical feature.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 1862 newspaper provides uniquely valuable evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Dual Usage**: The appearance of both "Little Falls" and "Falls Church" in the same newspaper issue demonstrates the historical connection between these two names.

2. **Geographical and Community Distinction**: The usage pattern suggests "Little Falls" referred specifically to the geographical feature and its infrastructure, while "Falls Church" referred to the community that had developed nearby.

3. **Naming Transition Documentation**: The shift from the earlier "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) seen in this document helps establish when this linguistic change occurred, supporting the argument that the name evolved over time.

4. **Civil War Context**: The strategic importance of both Little Falls bridge and Falls Church during this critical period of the Civil War adds historical weight to both locations and their names.

This August 1862 newspaper provides crucial evidence of how the area's naming evolved, showing that "Little Falls" remained the recognized name for the geographical feature even as "Falls Church" was beginning to be established as the name for the community - demonstrating that the proposed renaming would actually reconnect the community with its original geographical identity.

# Mosby's Latest Raid Near Falls Church

## Transcription

"Mosby's Latest Raid.—We are indebted to a gentleman residing near Falls Church, and not far from Bailey's Cross Roads, for the annexed account of the raid of Mosby on Sunday last:—[Nat. Int.]

"On the 16th, just about daylight, Mosby and fifty-four of his men were seen about a mile from fort Buffalo, with three Union soldiers and some horses with harness that they had captured from a train of sutlers early in the night before. They disappeared suddenly in the woods for the time being, but about nine o'clock at night Mosby, with fifteen men and those three Union prisoners, made their appearance at the northwest end of Falls Church village, and turned to the left of the Leesburg turnpike, on the Lewinsville road, through by the contraband camp on Major Nutt's place; then through by the Brick Chapel to the turnpike by Fort Buffalo, down the turnpike one mile below Bailey's Cross Roads; then back the same route to the railroad. Mosby and six men dismounted and approached the contraband camp, when the guard halted him; he gave no reply and moved on, when the guard shot and one of the Union prisoners made his escape. Mosby then fell back and moved through Falls Church up the turnpike to a little tavern, where they stopped, and was telling the keeper of the hotel where they had been, and that they could go where they pleased, when a detachment of the California cavalry came up and drove them beyond Difficult run four miles from Dranesville."

## Historical Context

This August 19, 1863 account in the Alexandria Gazette details a raid conducted by Confederate partisan ranger Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his men on August 16, 1863. Mosby was known for his lightning raids behind Union lines, earning him the nickname "the Gray Ghost." This report, attributed to a local resident near Falls Church, describes Mosby's movements with typical precision:

1. Mosby and 54 men were spotted near Fort Buffalo with captured Union soldiers and horses
2. Later that night, Mosby with a smaller force of 15 men appeared at Falls Church village
3. They traveled through various local landmarks including the contraband camp (a settlement for escaped slaves)
4. An encounter with guards resulted in one Union prisoner escaping
5. Mosby returned through Falls Church before being pursued by California cavalry

The raid occurred during a period following the major battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg (July 1863), when Confederate forces were increasingly turning to guerrilla-style warfare in Northern Virginia to disrupt Union supply lines and maintain pressure on Union forces despite diminishing conventional military capabilities.

The reference to "contraband camp" reflects the presence of freed or escaped slaves who had sought protection behind Union lines. These individuals were initially classified as "contraband of war" (hence the name) when they fled to Union forces.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This August 19, 1863 newspaper reference is noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Continued Inconsistency**: The article uses "Falls Church" without the apostrophe consistently throughout, continuing the pattern seen in the July 15, 1863 notice from the same newspaper. This suggests that by mid-to-late summer 1863, the non-possessive form was becoming more standard in the Alexandria Gazette.

2. **Multiple References**: The article refers to "Falls Church" twice - first as a location ("near Falls Church") and later as an established village ("Falls Church village"), demonstrating that the name was now applied to both the church building and the surrounding community.

3. **Local Source**: The information comes from "a gentleman residing near Falls Church," suggesting that local residents were using this form of the name.

4. **Detailed Geography**: The account provides precise geographical details, showing that Falls Church was an established landmark with recognized relationships to other local features (northwest end, relation to the Leesburg turnpike, etc.).

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 19, 1863 reference provides additional evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Naming Convention Evolution**: Coming five weeks after the July 11-15, 1863 references that showed both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" being used interchangeably, this consistently non-possessive usage suggests the name was still evolving throughout 1863.

2. **Community Identity Formation**: The reference to "Falls Church village" shows that by August 1863, the name was being applied to the settlement rather than just the church building itself, representing a key step in the evolution from a landmark to a community identity.

3. **Historical Significance**: The account shows Falls Church's strategic importance during the Civil War as a location through which military movements occurred and where infrastructure (roads, railroad) converged.

4. **Connection to Major Events**: The document connects Falls Church to significant Civil War figures and events (Mosby's raids), highlighting its place in the broader historical narrative of Virginia.

When added to our existing timeline of historical references, this August 1863 account further documents the fluid nature of naming conventions during the Civil War period. It demonstrates that even within a single newspaper, naming practices for Falls Church evolved throughout 1863, shifting from the possessive form ("Fall's Church") to the non-possessive form ("Falls Church") that would eventually become standardized.

This fluid evolution of the name supports the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally change over time to reflect historical context and community understanding, making the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" consistent with, rather than contrary to, historical precedent.

# Fall's Church Theft Reward Notice

## Transcription

TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.
THE Vestry of Fall's Church will give the above reward for the apprehension and conviction of the person or persons, who, on the night of the 19th instant, broke into the Church and feloniously abstracted a portion of the pulpit decorations, consisting of several yards of Crimson Silk Velvet. By order,
JOHN O. LINDSEY,
Senior Warden.
Fairfax County, June 26--3t

## Historical Context

This 1839 reward notice provides evidence of several aspects of the history of Fall's Church:

1. The formal organization of the church with a vestry and senior warden (John O. Lindsey) overseeing its affairs

2. The church's interior decoration, which included "Crimson Silk Velvet" pulpit decorations valuable enough to warrant a significant reward of twenty dollars when stolen

3. The church's location within Fairfax County

4. The fact that the church building was secure enough that breaking in was necessary to commit the theft

The notice appeared in the Alexandria Gazette, suggesting the church had connections to Alexandria and that its affairs were considered newsworthy to readers in that city.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This notice from 1839 continues the spelling convention of "Fall's Church" with an apostrophe, consistent with the earlier 1802 mention of "Fall's Church road." This spelling appears in an official communication from the church's own vestry, indicating this was the formal name used by the church leadership itself at this time.

The significance of this consistent apostrophe usage includes:

1. **Institutional Self-Identification**: The church vestry—the official governing body—refers to itself as "Fall's Church" with an apostrophe, providing strong evidence this was the accepted institutional name.

2. **Persistence Over Time**: The consistent apostrophe between 1802 and 1839 (a span of 37 years) demonstrates this wasn't a one-time variation but an established naming convention that persisted across decades.

3. **Formal Documentation**: This appears in an official notice published in a major newspaper, suggesting it was the formal, recognized spelling used in public communications.

4. **Continued Possessive Form**: The apostrophe in "Fall's" continues to indicate a possessive relationship between the geographic feature (the Fall) and the church, reinforcing the understanding that the church was defined by its location relative to this landmark.

This document provides important evidence that the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" was not an anomaly but rather the standard spelling used by the church itself in the early-to-mid 19th century.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1839 vestry notice provides additional compelling evidence supporting the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Institutional Acknowledgment**: The vestry's own use of "Fall's Church" (with the apostrophe) shows that even the church's leadership historically understood its identity as being defined by its relationship to the geographical feature.

2. **Established Pattern**: Combined with the 1802 document, this establishes a clear pattern of apostrophe usage spanning nearly four decades, strengthening the historical case for the geographical basis of the name.

3. **Official Usage**: This represents formal, official usage by institutional leadership rather than casual reference, giving it particular weight in understanding the historical name.

4. **Timeline Establishment**: This document helps establish a timeline of when the apostrophe was in common use, which is valuable for tracing how and when the name evolved to the current "Falls Church" without an apostrophe.

The vestry's own identification as "Fall's Church" provides powerful evidence that renaming to "Little Falls" would be historically consistent with how the area's identity was originally understood—as a place defined by its geographical features rather than solely by a religious institution. The apostrophe in the original name clearly indicates the church was "of the Fall" or "at the Fall," demonstrating the primacy of the geographical feature in the area's historical identity.

# Artillery Skirmish at Fall's Church

## Transcription

"WAR NEWS.

Gen. McClellan, it is understood, is now to take the field. All the officers in Washington have been ordered to their commands. The Confederate force on the upper Potomac is said to consist of the forces under the command of Gens. Jackson, Ewell, Longstreet and Walker.

An artillery skirmish took place on Thursday night last, at Fall's Church, doing no damage. The Federal force occupying the position at Aquia Creek evacuated the place on Friday last, after removing all the stores and destroying the depot buildings.

The Federal troops were yet in possession of Martinsburg, Virginia, yesterday. A dispatch states the Confederates, four hundred strong, attacked the outposts, but were defeated, with a loss of about fifty taken prisoners. The Federal loss was reported two killed and ten wounded."

## Historical Context

This September 1862 war report from the Alexandria Gazette documents an artillery skirmish at Fall's Church during the Civil War. The report is brief, noting that the skirmish resulted in "no damage." This minor military encounter occurred during a critical period of the Civil War in Virginia:

1. The Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28-30, 1862) had just concluded about a week earlier
2. The Maryland Campaign, which would culminate in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, was underway
3. General George B. McClellan had recently been restored to command of the Army of the Potomac

The report mentions Confederate forces under Generals Jackson, Ewell, Longstreet, and Walker operating along the upper Potomac. These were major components of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, which was moving north into Maryland at the time. The artillery skirmish at Fall's Church likely represented probing actions or minor encounters between advance units or patrols.

The document illustrates how Falls Church found itself in a contested area during the Civil War, with both Federal and Confederate forces operating in the vicinity.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This September 1862 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in earlier documents:

1. **Wartime Consistency**: Despite the disruptions of the Civil War, the spelling "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe persists in this 1862 reference, showing remarkable consistency with earlier usages from 1802, 1839, and 1860.

2. **Military Reporting**: As a military report concerning actual operations, this document likely reflects formal naming conventions used in military records and maps, suggesting "Fall's Church" remained the recognized designation for the location.

3. **Mid-Civil War Context**: This September 1862 reference comes approximately a year and a half into the Civil War, providing evidence that the apostrophe usage continued throughout the early war period.

4. **Publication Continuity**: The consistent use of the apostrophe in multiple issues of the Alexandria Gazette across different years (1839, 1860, and now 1862) demonstrates editorial consistency in the paper's treatment of the name.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1862 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Extended Apostrophe Timeline**: This document further extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" through 1862, spanning six decades (1802-1862) of consistent usage across multiple sources.

2. **Military Geography**: The identification of Fall's Church as a location of military significance during the Civil War demonstrates its established identity as a recognized place in Virginia.

3. **Historical Narrative Enrichment**: The war reference adds complexity to the historical narrative of the area, showing its involvement in the Civil War - a dimension that could be incorporated into educational materials related to the renaming initiative.

4. **Official Military Usage**: The mention in the context of military operations suggests the name "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe was used in official military communications and reporting.

This 1862 war report adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall) even during the tumultuous period of the Civil War.

# Mosby's Men Interrupt Picnic Near Falls Church

## Transcription

"Another Exploit of Moseby [Mosby]. WASHINGTON, July 9.--A letter from Annadale [Annandale], dated July 8, says: [...]

The Washington Star says:--'On Friday a party of young ladies and gentlemen had a picnic near Falls Church, Va., and in the midst of their pleasures they were surprised at the appearance of about twenty-five of Mosby's men, who told them not to be afraid, and danced a set with the ladies, after which they went to the wagons and devoured the cream and edibles provided for the occasion. They then made off.'"

## Historical Context

This July 11, 1864 article in the Alexandria Gazette reports on multiple exploits of Confederate partisan ranger Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his men. While the first part of the article describes a significant military engagement near Aldie where Mosby captured Union soldiers and valuable equipment, the section about Falls Church reveals a different side of guerrilla operations during the Civil War.

The picnic incident occurred in early July 1864, during the fourth summer of the Civil War. By this time, the war had taken a decisive turn against the Confederacy:

1. Union forces under General Grant were engaged in the grueling Overland Campaign against Lee in central Virginia
2. Sherman was advancing toward Atlanta in Georgia
3. The Shenandoah Valley was becoming a major theater of operations

Despite these larger campaigns, Mosby's Rangers continued to operate effectively behind Union lines in Northern Virginia, conducting raids, gathering intelligence, and disrupting Union operations. This incident shows that even amid the harsh realities of war, there were moments of unexpected and relatively peaceful interaction between Confederate guerrillas and civilians.

The article offers a glimpse into civilian social life in wartime Virginia. Despite the dangers of the war zone, residents near Falls Church were still attempting to maintain some normalcy through social gatherings like picnics. This suggests that by summer 1864:

1. Union control of the Falls Church area was secure enough that civilians felt comfortable holding outdoor social events
2. The area around Falls Church was populated enough to support social gatherings
3. The community had adapted to the presence of both Union forces and Confederate guerrillas, navigating their daily lives amid the conflict

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This July 11, 1864 newspaper reference continues the pattern observed in the Alexandria Gazette throughout the second half of 1863, using "Falls Church" without the apostrophe. This usage extends the documented standardization period:

1. **Extended Standardization**: The use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe now spans from July 1863 through July 1864 in the Alexandria Gazette, suggesting the non-possessive form had become firmly established in this publication.

2. **Continued Editorial Policy**: The consistent spelling across a full year indicates this was a deliberate editorial policy rather than random variation.

3. **Established Community Recognition**: The reference to "Falls Church" as a recognized location for civilian social activities shows it was well-established as a community identity beyond just military significance.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 1864 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Name Evolution Confirmation**: The continued use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe through July 1864 confirms the standardization of the modern spelling was complete by this time, at least in major local newspapers.

2. **Community Life Documentation**: The picnic incident reveals that Falls Church had a civilian population that maintained social activities despite the war, indicating its development as a community with an established identity.

3. **Extended Timeline**: This reference extends our documentation of naming conventions by nearly a year beyond previous sources, demonstrating the continued evolution and standardization of the name.

4. **Cultural Significance**: The incident shows Falls Church was not just a military outpost but also a place where civilians gathered, suggesting it had cultural and social significance in addition to its strategic importance.

When added to our existing timeline, this July 1864 account further supports the argument that place names naturally evolve over time. The transition from "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) was completed during the Civil War period, with the standardization firmly established by 1864. This historical evolution parallels the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA," which would reconnect the community with its original geographical identity.

The fact that civilians were holding picnics "near Falls Church" in 1864 also demonstrates that the name referred to more than just the church building itself - it had become the recognized name for the surrounding area and community, just as "Little Falls" had been for the geographical feature from which the church derived its name.

# Confederate Forces Near and Occupying Falls Church

## Transcription

"Information reached Washington yesterday that a force of Confederates were at the Frying Pan, on Goose Creek, seven miles above Falls Church, and it was conjectured that their purpose is to make a demonstration against the fortifications on the south side, when they may think that the operations on the north side shall have induced the withdrawal of the forces in the works on the Virginia side of the Potomac.--Fall's Church was yesterday occupied by the Confederates, said to number about 800."

## Historical Context

This July 13, 1864 article in the Alexandria Gazette reports on Confederate movements near Washington, D.C., during what would become known as Early's Raid on Washington. Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early led his corps from the Shenandoah Valley to the outskirts of Washington in July 1864, threatening the Union capital while the main Union armies were occupied with Grant's campaign against Richmond and Petersburg.

The article describes two significant military developments around Falls Church:

1. Confederate forces positioned at Frying Pan (near Goose Creek), about seven miles from Falls Church, possibly preparing to attack Washington's southern defenses
2. The occupation of Falls Church itself by approximately 800 Confederate troops

This occurred during a critical moment in the Civil War, when:
- Confederate forces were within sight of the U.S. Capitol dome
- Railroad and telegraph connections between Washington and Baltimore had been cut
- The Union was hurriedly assembling defenders, including "Union Leagues" of civilian volunteers

The occupation of Falls Church by Confederate forces came just days after the picnic incident reported in the July 11 issue of the same newspaper, where Mosby's men had danced with local women before making off with their picnic supplies. This new military occupation represented a much more serious Confederate presence, part of a coordinated campaign against Washington rather than a guerrilla raid.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling Variation

This July 13, 1864 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy because it uses both spelling conventions within the same article:

1. **Mixed Usage**: The article first refers to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) and then to "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) just sentences apart, in the same paragraph.

2. **Editorial Inconsistency**: This mixed usage in a single article demonstrates that even in mid-1864, after nearly a year of generally standardized usage in the Alexandria Gazette, the spelling was still not fully settled.

3. **Same Author, Same Article**: Unlike previous examples where different spelling conventions appeared in different articles potentially written by different correspondents, this inconsistency appears within text likely written by the same person.

4. **Continued Fluidity**: This dual usage suggests that the standardization process was incomplete, with both forms still considered acceptable even within formal reporting.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 1864 reference provides compelling support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Ongoing Naming Evolution**: The mixed usage of both "Falls Church" and "Fall's Church" in the same article shows that naming conventions remained fluid even a year into what we had identified as the "standardization period."

2. **Documented Inconsistency**: This reference captures the clearest evidence yet of ongoing uncertainty about the "correct" spelling of the name, with both forms used interchangeably by the same writer.

3. **Strategic Importance**: The Confederate occupation of Falls Church further establishes its strategic significance during the Civil War as a location worth controlling militarily.

4. **Geographical Framework**: The reference to Falls Church as a recognized reference point for describing other locations ("seven miles above Falls Church") confirms its status as an established geographical marker.

When added to our existing timeline, this July 13, 1864 reference significantly complicates the narrative of straightforward standardization. Rather than showing a clean transition from the possessive "Fall's Church" to the non-possessive "Falls Church," it reveals that both forms continued to coexist even in formal writing, sometimes within the same text.

This documented fluidity in naming conventions provides strong historical precedent for the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing historical and cultural contexts. The evidence shows that even the current name of Falls Church emerged through a complex and inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing an unchanging historical designation.

# Guerrilla Visit to Government Farm at Falls Church

## Transcription

"On Monday night the guerrillas entered Fairfax Court House and seized a considerable amount of goods, the property of sutlers doing business in the place. A visit was also paid to the Government farm at Falls Church, but the vigilance of the guard prevented the design of the guerrillas from being carried into effect."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from the October 7, 1863 edition of the Alexandria Gazette reports on Confederate guerrilla activity in Northern Virginia, specifically mentioning two locations:

1. Fairfax Court House, where the guerrillas successfully seized sutlers' goods
2. The Government farm at Falls Church, where their plans were thwarted by vigilant guards

This account comes from a period when Confederate guerrilla warfare was intensifying in Northern Virginia. Following major Confederate defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, Confederate irregular forces like Mosby's Rangers increasingly focused on harassing Union supply lines, attacking isolated outposts, and conducting raids behind Union lines.

The reference to a "Government farm at Falls Church" is particularly interesting, as it reveals an aspect of Union military operations in the area not mentioned in previous reports. During the Civil War, the Union Army established farms in occupied territories to supply food for troops and horses. These facilities were strategically important and thus became targets for Confederate raiders.

The guerrilla activity reported in this notice likely occurred on October 5, 1863, as the newspaper is dated October 7, and the event is described as happening "On Monday night" (Monday would have been October 5).

This report comes less than two months after the August 16 raid by Mosby detailed in the August 19, 1863 issue of the same newspaper, suggesting that Falls Church and the surrounding area remained contested territory and a frequent target for Confederate operations throughout the fall of 1863.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This October 7, 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern observed in the July 15 and August 19, 1863 issues of the Alexandria Gazette, using "Falls Church" without the apostrophe. This consistent usage over a period of nearly three months indicates that by autumn 1863, the non-possessive form was becoming standardized in this newspaper, though variations still appeared in other contexts.

Key observations about this reference:

1. **Continued Standardization**: The consistent use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe in the Alexandria Gazette from July through October 1863 suggests a deliberate editorial choice or evolving convention.

2. **Institutional Recognition**: The reference to a "Government farm at Falls Church" shows that the non-possessive form was being used in official or semi-official contexts, not just in casual reporting.

3. **Geographical Identity**: Falls Church is referred to as a distinct location comparable to Fairfax Court House, indicating its established status as a recognized community with strategic importance.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This October 1863 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Naming Evolution Confirmation**: The continued use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe from July through October 1863 shows the standardization of the modern spelling was occurring gradually throughout the Civil War period.

2. **Historical Significance**: The mention of a Government farm establishes Falls Church as a location of military importance during the Civil War, with infrastructure that supported Union operations in Northern Virginia.

3. **Community Identity Development**: By October 1863, Falls Church was clearly recognized as more than just a church building - it was an established location with government facilities and sufficient strategic importance to warrant Confederate attention.

4. **Documented Name Transformation**: When viewed alongside earlier references, this October 1863 mention adds to the body of evidence showing how the name evolved from "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) over time.

This continued documentation of the name's evolution throughout 1863 reinforces the central argument that place names naturally change to reflect shifting historical and cultural contexts. Just as "Fall's Church" gradually transformed to "Falls Church" during the Civil War period, the proposed change to "Little Falls, VA" represents another evolution that reconnects the community with its original geographical identity.

# 2nd District of Columbia Regiment Picketing from Falls Church to Vienna

## Transcription

"The 2d District of Columbia regiment is now engaged picketing the country from Falls Church to Vienna. Col. Alexander's headquarters at Vienna, and that of Lieut. Col. Drew at Falls Church."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from the November 6, 1863 edition of the Alexandria Gazette reports on the deployment of the 2nd District of Columbia Regiment along the strategic corridor between Falls Church and Vienna, Virginia. The regiment's mission was "picketing" - establishing a defensive perimeter with sentries and outposts to guard against enemy movement or infiltration.

This military deployment highlights several important aspects of the Civil War in Northern Virginia:

1. **Strategic Importance**: The Falls Church to Vienna corridor required ongoing military protection more than two and a half years into the war, indicating its strategic value for controlling access to Washington, D.C.

2. **Continued Confederate Threat**: Despite major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, Confederate forces (particularly irregular units like Mosby's Rangers) remained active in Northern Virginia, necessitating constant vigilance.

3. **Military Infrastructure**: The establishment of a regimental headquarters at Falls Church underscores the area's development as a significant military outpost during the war.

4. **Divided Command Structure**: The regiment operated with split headquarters - the commanding officer (Col. Alexander) at Vienna and the second-in-command (Lt. Col. Drew) at Falls Church - indicating the importance of maintaining command presence at both locations.

This deployment occurred during a relatively quiet period on the main battlefronts following the Bristoe Campaign (October 1863), when the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia were regrouping. During such periods, maintaining picket lines and defensive perimeters against guerrilla activities became even more important for Union forces.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This November 6, 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern observed in the Alexandria Gazette throughout the second half of 1863, using "Falls Church" without the apostrophe. This consistent usage over a four-month period (July through November 1863) strengthens the evidence for a deliberate standardization toward the non-possessive form:

1. **Consistent Editorial Policy**: The Alexandria Gazette appears to have adopted a consistent editorial approach to the spelling by late 1863, suggesting an intentional standardization rather than random variation.

2. **Military Recognition**: The placement of a regimental headquarters at "Falls Church" indicates that this spelling was being used in official military communications and planning.

3. **Geographic Significance**: Falls Church is presented as a location of comparable strategic importance to Vienna, further cementing its status as a recognized community and military position rather than simply a church building.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This November 1863 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Standardization Timeline**: The continued use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe from July through November 1863 reinforces the pattern of standardization toward the modern spelling during the Civil War period.

2. **Military Significance**: The establishment of a regimental headquarters at Falls Church confirms the area's strategic importance during the Civil War and its recognition as a distinct community by military authorities.

3. **Ongoing Name Evolution**: When viewed in sequence with earlier references, this November 1863 mention adds to the documentation of how the name evolved from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church" over time.

4. **Community Identity Formation**: The designation of Falls Church as important enough to host a regimental headquarters reflects its development as a recognized community with military significance beyond its religious origins.

This reference, coming at the end of 1863, helps establish a clear timeline for the evolution of the name toward its modern spelling. The pattern of consistent usage in the Alexandria Gazette throughout the second half of 1863 shows that the standardization process, while still ongoing, was becoming more firmly established by the end of that year.

Just as the name evolved from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church" during this period, the proposed change to "Little Falls, VA" represents another evolution that reconnects the community with its original geographical identity, consistent with the historical pattern of place names naturally changing to reflect their historical and cultural context.

# Snakebite Incident Near Little Falls

## Transcription

"Monday last, a Mr. Gann, who resides in Virginia, while bathing in the Potomac, near the little Falls, was bitten by a snake. In a short time not only his leg was almost incredibly swollen, but his whole side turned to a hue almost black. Two or three physicians were procured from this city, and were promptly on the spot, but when our informant left, there was no abatement of the swelling or pain."

## Historical Context

This brief news item from August 1854 reports on a serious snakebite incident that occurred at "the little Falls" of the Potomac River. The victim, identified only as "Mr. Gann," was a Virginia resident who was bitten while bathing in the river. The severe symptoms described (extreme swelling, discoloration) suggest the bite may have been from a venomous snake, likely a copperhead or timber rattlesnake, both of which were native to the region.

The incident highlights several aspects of mid-19th century life in the region:

1. The Potomac River, including the Little Falls area, was used for recreational activities such as bathing
2. The natural environment still posed significant dangers to residents
3. Medical response involved physicians traveling from the city (likely Washington or Alexandria) to attend to patients in outlying areas

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This 1854 newspaper reference provides additional evidence of the widespread use of "little Falls" as a geographical designation in Northern Virginia during the mid-19th century:

1. **Casual Reference**: Like the 1862 fishing notice, this brief news item mentions "the little Falls" without further explanation, indicating it was a well-known location to readers.

2. **Navigation Point**: The location is used as a primary reference point to indicate where the incident occurred, suggesting it was a recognized landmark.

3. **Recreational Use**: The mention of bathing adds to our understanding of how the Little Falls area was used by local residents.

4. **Cross-Newspaper Consistency**: This reference in the Alexandria Gazette complements similar references in other newspapers like The Star, showing consistent usage across different publications.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1854 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Timeline Expansion**: This 1854 mention fills a gap in our documented timeline of "Little Falls" usage, falling between the 1853 bridge construction reference and the 1862 fishing notice.

2. **Virginia Connection**: The specific mention that Mr. Gann "resides in Virginia" creates a direct connection between Virginia residents and Little Falls as a location they frequented.

3. **Geographical Reference**: The consistent use of Little Falls as a geographical reference point in news reporting demonstrates its established status in regional geography.

4. **Public Familiarity**: The casual reference in a news item intended for general readership indicates that "little Falls" was the standard, publicly recognized name for this location in 1854.

This brief news item adds another data point to our growing collection of evidence showing that "Little Falls" was the established, recognized name for this geographical feature throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

# Lincoln Votes at Fall's Church Precinct

## Transcription

"THE TENTH LEGION.—The Tenth Legion of Democracy, it will be seen by the following, gave a majority for Bell over Breckinridge of nearly 2,500, and over Douglas of nearly 3,000. And even adding the vote of Douglas and Breckinridge together, Bell is in a minority of only 1300 in the famed Tenth Legion. The following is the vote:
[Vote tallies for various counties in the Tenth Legion]

SEVENTH DISTRICT.
[Vote tallies for various counties in the Seventh District]

Lincoln received 2 votes in Alexandria city, and 12 at the county precinct, 24 votes in Fairfax, (19 of them at Fall's Church;) 55 in Prince William, (all at Occoquan;) and 1 in Fauquier, a total of 94."

## Historical Context

This November 1860 election report from the Alexandria Gazette provides a fascinating glimpse into voting patterns just before the Civil War. The report details votes in Virginia's "Tenth Legion" and "Seventh District," showing strong support for Constitutional Union candidate John Bell over Southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge and Northern Democratic candidate Stephen A. Douglas.

Most significantly for Falls Church history, the article specifically notes that Abraham Lincoln received 24 votes in Fairfax County, with "19 of them at Fall's Church." This reveals:

1. Falls Church was established as an official voting precinct by 1860
2. The area had unusual political leanings compared to surrounding regions
3. A small but significant pocket of Republican support existed in Falls Church

The 1860 presidential election was one of the most consequential in American history, directly preceding the Civil War. Lincoln won the presidency despite not even appearing on the ballot in most Southern states. Virginia as a whole voted strongly against Lincoln, making these 19 votes at Fall's Church statistically insignificant to the election outcome but historically significant as evidence of Union sentiment in an otherwise Confederate-leaning state.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This 1860 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in earlier documents:

1. **Ongoing Apostrophe Usage**: The spelling "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe persists in this 1860 reference, showing consistency with the 1802 "Fall's Church road" reference and the 1839 vestry notice.

2. **Election Document Formality**: As an official election report, this document likely reflects formal naming conventions used in government records, suggesting "Fall's Church" remained the official designation.

3. **Pre-Civil War Context**: This November 1860 reference comes just months before the start of the Civil War, providing evidence that the apostrophe usage continued through the antebellum period.

4. **Print Standardization**: The consistent use of the apostrophe across multiple decades and publications (Alexandria Advertiser in 1802, Alexandria Gazette in 1839 and 1860) suggests this wasn't merely a typographical variance but a standardized spelling.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1860 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Continued Apostrophe Usage**: The persistence of "Fall's Church" (with the apostrophe) in 1860 reinforces the argument that the area was historically understood to be named for its relationship to the geographical feature - it was the church "of the Fall" or "at the Fall."

2. **Timeline Extension**: This document extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" to at least 1860, spanning nearly six decades (1802-1860) and showing remarkable consistency across multiple sources.

3. **Political Geography**: The identification of Fall's Church as a distinct voting precinct demonstrates its established identity as a recognized place within Fairfax County by 1860.

4. **Historical Complexity**: The unusual voting pattern at Fall's Church (19 votes for Lincoln) suggests a community that may have had distinct cultural or demographic characteristics compared to surrounding areas, potentially supporting the argument for recognizing its unique identity through renaming.

This 1860 election report adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall).

# Festival at New Church on Fall's Road

## Transcription

"NOTICE.--A FESTIVAL will be held on next Thursday and Friday, the 22d, and 23d instants, in the new Church erected on the Fall's Road, Alexandria County, three miles from Georgetown, and about 1½ miles west of Ball's Cross Roads. The proceeds to be appropriated to the benefit of said Church. LECTURES and other entertainments during the day and evening. DINNER AND SUPPER provided for each day. The public are invited to attend. By order."

## Historical Context

This November 20, 1855 notice in the Alexandria Gazette announces a fundraising festival for a "new Church erected on the Fall's Road." This reference comes from an interesting transitional period in the area's development, just a few years before the Civil War and during a time when the community that would become Falls Church was still being defined geographically rather than as a distinct settlement.

The notice provides several important geographical markers that help locate this church:
1. It was on "Fall's Road" in Alexandria County (now Arlington County)
2. It was three miles from Georgetown
3. It was about 1½ miles west of Ball's Cross Roads (now the Ballston area of Arlington)

This places the church in what was likely the general vicinity of what would later be called Falls Church, though the exact identification with the historic Falls Church building would require additional research.

## Significance of "Fall's Road" Reference

This November 1855 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Road vs. Church Naming**: It refers to "Fall's Road" rather than "Fall's Church," suggesting that at this time, the road leading to the falls was a more prominent geographical identifier than the church itself

2. **Possessive Form**: The road is called "Fall's Road," using the possessive form consistent with early references to "Fall's Church," indicating the road was named for its destination (the falls)

3. **New Church Construction**: The notice mentions a "new Church erected," which could suggest either that this was a newly constructed church building at an established site, or potentially a completely new church location

4. **Geographical Reference Point**: The church is described primarily by its geographic location relative to other known landmarks (Georgetown and Ball's Cross Roads) rather than as a community identifier itself

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This November 1855 reference provides valuable context for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Road Named for Falls**: The existence of "Fall's Road" confirms that roads in the area were named for their destination (the falls), reinforcing the geographical primacy of the falls in local naming conventions

2. **Pre-Community Naming**: This reference suggests that before "Fall's Church" became established as a community name, the area was identified by its relationship to the geographical feature (the falls) via the road name

3. **Geographical Logic**: The naming pattern follows natural geographical logic - the falls were the primary landmark, the road was named for its destination at the falls, and eventually the church along that road became a landmark itself

4. **Evolutionary Process**: This represents an earlier stage in the naming evolution, showing how place names developed organically from geographical features (falls → Fall's Road → Fall's Church → Falls Church)

When added to our existing timeline, this November 1855 reference helps fill an important gap between the early colonial references to "Little Falls" and the Civil War era fluctuation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church." It shows that before the community took on the church's name, the area was identified by roads named for their destinations at the falls, providing another link in the chain connecting the current name back to its geographical origins.

This evidence strengthens the argument that the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative would reconnect the community with its earliest geographical naming logic, restoring the primacy of the natural feature that gave rise to all subsequent naming in the area.

# Hangman's Tree Historical Illustration

## Description

This image depicts the legendary "Hangman's Tree" that stood in Falls Church, Virginia until 1968. The large oak tree was rumored to be a site where Confederate Colonel John Mosby allegedly ordered his men to hang Union soldiers during the Civil War, though historical records do not conclusively verify these claims.

## Image Source

This illustration was digitized from the historical book "FALLS CHURCH: By Fence and Fireside" and digitally re-rendered using AI enhancement technology.

## Digital Version

## Historical Significance

The Hangman's Tree was a local landmark that represented the complex and sometimes contested history of Falls Church during the Civil War period. Though the tree was cut down in 1968, a historical marker now stands at its former location, commemorating both the tree and the local legends associated with it.

# Truro Parish Vestry Book - First Written Record of 'Falls Church' Name (1757)

## Image Description
Facsimile of the Truro Parish Vestry Book from November 28, 1757, showing the earliest known written use of the name "Falls Church." The name appears prominently in financial records (middle of the page) detailing payments made to local church officials: "John Samlby Clk" (Clerk) at "Falls Church & Alexandria" (receiving 2,000 units), and "Owen Palmore Sexton" (church caretaker) at "Falls Church" (receiving 560 units). This document confirms the early existence and official recognition of Falls Church as a distinct location within Truro Parish, decades before the town itself was formally incorporated.

## Historical Significance
This document represents the first known written record of the name "Falls Church," establishing the term's usage in official colonial records. The vestry book entry predates the formal establishment of the town, showing that the church itself (and its location near the falls) was already a recognized landmark and community center in the mid-18th century.

# Professor Lowe Making a Balloon Ascension

![Professor Lowe making a balloon ascension on a reconnoitering expedition to Vienna](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/%22Professor_Lowe_making_a_balloon_ascension_on_a_reconnoitering_expedition_to_Vienna%22_-_Intrepid_%28balloon_aircraft%29_illustration_in_Harper%27s_Weekly_on_December_14%2C_1861%2C_Volume_5%2C_Issue_259_%28cropped%29.jpg)

## Description

This illustration from Harper's Weekly depicts Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe making an ascent in his observation balloon "Intrepid" during a reconnaissance mission near Vienna, Virginia, in 1861. The image shows Union soldiers and officers gathered around as the balloon is prepared for launch, with Lowe apparently in the basket ready to ascend.

Lowe was the Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, the military aeronautical unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War. His balloons provided valuable reconnaissance information about Confederate troop movements, positions, and fortifications. This innovation represented one of the earliest military uses of aerial observation in American warfare.

The scene takes place in Fairfax County, as Vienna was a strategically important location during the early stages of the Civil War due to its proximity to Washington D.C. and key transportation routes. The illustration captures a moment that demonstrates the Union Army's technological innovations and intelligence-gathering methods during the conflict.

## Historical Context

Professor Lowe conducted numerous reconnaissance missions over Fairfax County and northern Virginia during 1861-1862. The balloons allowed Union commanders to observe Confederate positions from heights of up to 1,000 feet, gathering crucial intelligence about troop movements and fortifications.

The Union Army Balloon Corps was the first military aeronautical unit in American history. Though they operated for only two years (1861-1863), they conducted important aerial reconnaissance operations during the Peninsula Campaign and other Civil War engagements.

Vienna, Virginia, where this particular ascension took place, was the site of one of the war's earliest engagements in June 1861, when Confederate forces ambushed a Union train. The town remained strategically important throughout the war due to its location on the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad.

## Source Information

This illustration appeared in Harper's Weekly on December 14, 1861. Harper's Weekly was one of the most widely read journals during the Civil War period and frequently published illustrations of important wartime events. The original artist is unknown, as was common for many periodical illustrations of the era.

The image is now in the public domain due to its publication date.

![Chain Bridge over the Potomac at Little Falls near Georgetown](https://www.pafa.org/sites/default/files/artworkpics/1981_x_3_l.jpg)

## Description

This etching depicts the original Chain Bridge spanning across the Potomac River at Little Falls near Georgetown. The view shows the suspension bridge with its distinctive chains, from which it derived its name. In the foreground are trees and foliage framing the scene, with the rocky river banks visible below.

The bridge was designed with a 128-foot deck of oak planks suspended from chains made of four-and-a-half foot links anchored in massive stone abutments. This design was based on a patent by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The Chain Bridge was the third bridge built at this site after two previous wooden structures failed in 1804.

This image represents an important piece of Fairfax County history, as the bridge was a crucial transportation link between Virginia and Maryland, facilitating the movement of agricultural goods from the Shenandoah Valley to Georgetown markets in the early 19th century.

## Artist Information

The print was created by M. Stuart after a drawing by John Gadsby Chapman (1808-1889). Chapman was an American artist known for his painting and illustrations, particularly of Virginia landscapes and historical scenes. He was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and later studied in Europe before returning to America where he became known for his detailed lithographs and engravings of American scenes.

## Provenance

This print is held in the John S. Phillips Collection at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA).

## Black History honored at Tinner Hill

On January 16, 2024, the Falls Church City Council proposed an amendment to the City's Comprehensive Plan that would officially make a core area of Falls Church " [The Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District."](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/) This area, centered along South Washington Street (Lee Highway), will include the Tinner Hill Civil Rights Monument, Galloway United Methodist Church, the Henderson House, and the Tinner Hill Historic Site, as well as the homes in the Tinner Hill community along Tinner Hill Road.

The initial memorandum asking for this special designation was sent to the City Council on April 17, 2023 by the Falls Church Historical Commission on which I serve as vice chair. Officially designating the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District is honorific and does not affect zoning, permitting, or taxation, but hopefully will encourage heritage tourism and foot traffic to the area. Who knew it would be so difficult? But, I guess the wheels of bureaucracy grind slowly.

Those of us who live in Falls Church like to think that we are a "welcoming community," but it wasn't always that way. For some, the City's history is a difficult one. But for those who fought, struggled, and succeeded, the story is a triumphant, victorious one.

## **Civil War** and murder

In the early years of the Civil War, a school for African Americans was started by a lay preacher named John Read. His daughter Betsy began to teach Black people to read and write, which was against the law in Virginia. The school had room for 30 students, but as many as 60 would show up. So, 30 would sit, while 30 stood. After a while, they would change places.

Soon people hostile to the school began to take notice. Betsy then went to the homes of her students to teach much smaller groups. It was still a dangerous endeavor. Finally in 1864, John S. Mosby's Rangers came into the town under disguise and kidnapped Read. Frank Brooks, a Black home guard in the town blew his trumpet to sound the alarm of Mosby's approach. Brooks was shot and killed as the Rangers proceeded to their destination where they captured Read and another home guardsman named Jacob Jackson. They took the men out near Hunters Mill where they were both shot in the head, so the Rangers thought. Read died, but by some stroke of luck, Jackson escaped death, only losing an ear, and made it back to town to tell the whereabouts of Read's remains.

Before the Emancipation Proclamation, the 1860 census indicates there were 250 enslaved people within the Village of Falls Church. Once Union troops occupied Falls Church, those held in bondage were freed, because Virginia was a "state currently in rebellion..." According to the 1870 census, the African American population in the village comprised 42% of the inhabitants.

## **Post-Civil War early emancipation**

African Americans were able to purchase land in Falls Church, thanks to such liberal minded Northerners as Colonel John S. Crocker, a former Union officer. Many White Southerners were not willing to sell land to former enslaved people. Col. Crocker acted as a front man, buying the land and then selling it to African Americans.

Early African American landowners included Frederick F. Foote and Harriet Brice, who purchased their properties before the end of the Civil War. Foote bought 28 acres of land from Daniel Miner, who had once owned him. Brice once boasted that she purchased a plot of land in the center of town. James Lee acquired a relatively large plot from Col. Crocker along Shreve Road (now Annandale Road). Others were also able to buy lots in the area that was once the Dulaney Plantation. Soon, a significant number of formerly enslaved people lived on the southern border of the village.

In 1875 when the village became a town, African American cobbler and general store owner Frederick F. Foote, Jr. was elected Town Constable. In 1880, he was elected the first African American Town Councilman. Foote's electoral success was largely due to the fact that everyone knew him since his store was the largest in the area. People bought their goods from him at the store located in the center of town, next to The Falls Church. But another reason for his electoral success was the large male African American population in Falls Church that was able to vote. The majority of African Americans voted Republican, the party of Abraham Lincoln.

## Gerrymander and retrocession

Foote's election was problematic in a small southern town where most Whites voted the Democratic ticket. His tenure as a Town Councilman was filled with contention and bitterness. The majority of the Town Council members were Democrats, and the 1890s were an era of retribution by Southerners who had been displaced by African Americans during Reconstruction because of their stance during the Civil War. This was a dangerous time for African Americans who had made great strides during the 10-15 years following the end of war.

Fred Foote found himself in a hostile environment of constant marginalization at every turn during his time on the Council. In 1887, the final step was taken when the majority of the Town Council voted to gerrymander out of the town the section where most of the African American population lived. One third of Falls Church was retroceded back to Fairfax County, which effectively meant that African Americans had no say in town matters. Additionally, their once strong block of votes was marginalized because African Americans were now a small portion of the much larger jurisdiction of Fairfax County. Foote didn't live long enough to see the end of this process, passing one year before it was finalized by the state legislature in Richmond.

## Schools: Separate and unequal

One bright spot occurred in 1888 when the Society of Friends (Quakers) built the Falls Church Colored School with support from the Providence District of Fairfax County. Land was donated by James Lee, and a two-room schoolhouse was erected. The school was just a building without running water and with outhouses for toilets and a pot belly stove in the middle of the building that provided the classes heat in winter.

It was very different from the Jefferson Institute, the school for Whites in Falls Church, built in 1882. This school was a two-story brick structure with six classrooms, indoor plumbing, and central heat. When the White students received new textbooks, the old textbooks were passed down to the Black students. The books had missing pages and expletives written by the White students, who knew their old books would end up in the hands of African Americans.

## Falls Church passes a segregation ordinance

In 1915, the movie _Birth of a Nation_ produced a surge in membership of the Ku Klux Klan across the country. Here in Falls Church, we had our own rise in racial tensions with the proposal of a segregation ordinance designed to relegate Black people to a small section of town. Not only about segregated housing, this ordinance also effectively dictated where Black people could own land. The areas that were designated for Whites only basically meant they were "Sun Down" areas. In other words, you better not be caught in them after sundown if you were Black. The area designated for "Colored Only" constituted just five percent of the town's land mass.

#### CCPL and NAACP

On January 8, 1915, Edwin B. (E. B.) Henderson called a meeting of nine men who were considered the pillars of the Black community in Falls Church, which was held at the home of Joseph Tinner, a stone mason, known for his adeptness as a public speaker. These gentlemen formed an organization called the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL). They opposed restrictions on the African American population and started a letter writing campaign, sending letters to all the Town Councilmen as well as local churches and businesses, asking where they stood on the proposed segregation ordinance.

![Joseph Tinner photo](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-EBH-Joseph-Tinner.jpg)Joseph Tinner, stone mason and Civil Rights Leader (1875-1928)

In addition, the CCPL wrote to Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, asking for help from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) , and permission to form a branch of the Association in Falls Church. (Unfortunately, the bylaws of the NAACP required that in order to form a branch, 50 signatures were necessary. For a small farming community in a Southern state, that was a dangerous proposition). Henderson appeared before the Town Council and pleaded with its members not to approve the segregation ordinance, but the measure passed. That summer, a referendum was put before the town on the issue of creating the segregation districts. It, too, passed.

The CCPL then brought a lawsuit against Falls Church in Fairfax Circuit Court, an action that effectively placed an injunction on the enforcement of the ordinance. Henderson invited the judge to observe the districts that were proposed, after which the judge decided he would not rule on the matter because there was a similar case scheduled to come before the US Supreme Court. In 1917, _Warley v. Buchannan_ was heard in the Supreme Court, which ruled that creating such ordinances was unconstitutional, thereby nullifying the ordinance in Falls Church.

## Lee Highway

The US Supreme Court ruling was a clear victory for the CCPL. But it wouldn't last. The CCPL did become a branch of the NAACP, and there was much activism throughout Northern Virginia, starting with the formation of branches in Leesburg, Arlington, and Alexandria. But with the 50th anniversary of the Civil War, the call for Confederate monuments and a highway to honor Robert E. Lee put a damper on this progressive activism. There was talk of a Robert E. Lee Highway stretching from one end of the country to the other, from the East to the West. It might not have been as popular in other localities, but here in Lee's Virginia, and particularly in Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax County, the message was loud and clear.

There were mass meetings of concerned African Americans. James Weldon Johnson, the field agent for the NAACP, came and spoke. But little deference was given to the concerns of Black people during this era in America. In 1922, the route once known as Fairfax Court House Road, which stretched from Leesburg Pike, past The Falls Church, the Rolling Road, and what is now South Maple Avenue, was renamed Lee Highway. Lee was made a US highway, Route 29. The road cut directly through land that was owned by African Americans, the land taken for it by eminent domain.

## Our schools, our shame

The Falls Church Colored School was shuttered during World War I due to the lack of teachers. After the war, Mary Ellen "Miss Nellie" Henderson was approached to reopen the school. She was married to E. B. Henderson, whose family traced its roots in Falls Church to before the Revolutionary War. The Hendersons were both teachers in Washington, DC; however, back then when a woman married, she was no longer able (or allowed) to teach in the nation's capital. At first Mary Ellen resisted the request, saying she had just had a baby, but the community promised to help care for the child. The school reopened in1919, and Miss Nellie remained its principal for the next 30 years.

A model teacher in Washington, DC, Mrs. Henderson's standards were high. She approached the Fairfax County School Board on many occasions about the deplorable conditions under which she taught at the Falls Church Colored School. Finally in 1938, she used the Fairfax County Public Schools' budget to disprove the faulty logic of _Plessy v. Ferguson_'s "separate, but equal" clause. In a study titled "Our Disgrace and Shame," Mrs. Henderson showed how for that year, only 2.6% of the school budget was allocated to educating Black students, while 97.4% of the funding went to the schools educating White students.

Armed with this information, she formed an interracial committee to advocate for better schools for African Americans. Her efforts led to the replacement of the old, dilapidated Falls Church Colored School and the building of the James Lee Elementary School, the first modern school for African Americans in Fairfax County Public Schools.

## A vibrant Black community in Falls Church

The center of town in Falls Church was always a mix of Black and White, old and new. Fred Foote's store next to The Falls Church Episcopal Church was bought by his cousin Eliza Henderson, who passed it down to her daughter-in-law, who ran it for a third generation into the 1940s.

On the north side of Lee Highway stood the Falls Church Town Hall and jail and the town cobbler, Thomas's Shoe shop, whose proprietor knew everyone's shoe size and made shoes for both Black and White citizens. Robinson's Barbershop was between the cobbler and the Falls Church Bank, helping make this area the center of commerce for the little town, which we now call The Little City.

![Thomas Shoe store at the intersection of Broad and S Washington](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-EBH-Thomas-Shoe-Store-and-Star-Tavern.jpg)From the Mary Riley Styles Library Collection

Although strictly segregated, the African American community along Annandale Road was a vibrant community with two churches, Galloway United Methodist and Second Baptist Church. There were also social organizations such as the King Tyree Prince Hall Masonic Lodge, the Eastern Stars, the House of Ruth, and the Odd Fellows Lodge. Behind the Saunders's home was the local watering hole, the Blossom Inn Beer Garden, which doubled as a convenience store during the day where children attending the Falls Church Colored School bought their candy.

Dr. Harold Johnson, a professor at Georgetown University Medical School, provided excellent medical care for this community. And first-rate dental care was offered by Dr. Montgomery, whose office was on Annandale Road. Although it might not seem much by today's standards, at this time the African American community had all they needed to create a lively social structure for African Americans in Falls Church.

Starting around the 1890s, Merton E. Church sold lots to African Americans so they could build homes in the Southgate community. In the beginning, there were no public services there, including mail, trash, water, and the like. Viola Hudson, a dynamic woman, was the force in the community who would not accept second-class citizenship and led the charge to finally bring these basic services to that community.

## Zoning and eminent domain

Eminent domain and zoning African Americans out of their property became a powerful tool in the government's tool box to displace Black people in the early-to-mid-20th century. Whenever there was a need to build a road or something, "for the public good," the first place considered was the path of least resistance. It has been a common theme throughout the United States —  whenever a highway, or a school, or a hospital, or some facility that would serve the public good was needed, the cheapest land, the weak outcry from a marginalized population became easy pickings and a first resort for these projects.

Later after World War II, when large residential developments were starting to pop up everywhere in the Northern Virginia suburbs, the need for a shopping center or a new high school commonly resulted in encroaching on land previously owned by African Americans.

Red lining, a practice established by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and used by lenders and insurance companies, made it difficult, if not impossible, for Black people to qualify for FHA loans. And, in many of these new developments, the deeds had covenants that restricted the property from being sold to Black people. This era of massive development, between 1945 and 1970, meant buying a home and building middle class wealth for White families in the suburbs, but not for African Americans. Black families were locked out of the largest shift in wealth accumulation in America.

## **Integration: A double-edged sword**

Integration, or desegregation, in Northern Virginia came slowly. The Harry Byrd Machine vowed to set up roadblocks to the US Supreme Court decision in _Brown v. The Board of Education_, invoking the "Massive Resistance" movement to block the integration of schools in Virginia. Ultimately, Falls Church City Public Schools (1961-62) acquiesced to the court ruling more quickly than did Fairfax County Public Schools (1965-66). [Mr. John A. Johnson](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/), Falls Church City School Board chair, met with both E. B. and Mary Ellen Henderson, regarding the issue, and was open to integration as early as 1955, but resistance from other members of the school board and pressure from Richmond kept the idea from taking hold and growing here in Falls Church City until the early 1960s.

When desegregation of the schools finally came to Fairfax County in 1965, the local James Lee Elementary School was completely shuttered. Three years later, a young Black youth running from the police along Annandale Road was killed by the police vehicle. Consternation among the residents of the community led to protests along Annandale Road. The protest were effective in pressuring  the Fairfax County government to reconsider. The community needed something for the youth in the James Lee community, and the empty school was reopened as the James Lee Community Center.

## The importance of knowing our history

Interest in this history was reinvigorated with the founding of the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, Inc, in 1997. The Foundation is responsible for building monuments, conducting oral histories, painting murals, constructing a heritage trail, and erecting historic markers in the area. The Foundation successfully encouraged the local school system to name its middle school for Mary Ellen Henderson, the principal of the Falls Church Colored School. The Foundation also hosts an annual music festival to entertain and help carry our message of community well being here in Falls Church.

Although Falls Church hasn't always been a welcoming community to all its citizens, knowing and telling the truth of our history is important so that we are not doomed to repeat the mistakes and missteps of the past. My hope is that we move ahead to forge a more harmonious future for all citizens, regardless of our differences, whatever they are, whether they are based on race, nationality, religion, creed, or sexual orientation. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., _"We will either learn to live together as brothers, or die together as fools."_ I would prefer the former.

# Lost Horse Advertisement near Falls Church

## Transcription

TAKEN up by the Subscriber, living near the Fall's Church, in Fairfax County, on the 25th Day of October last, an Iron Grey Mare, about 13 Hands high, and 3 Years old, with a large Star in her Forehead, a white Spot on her Back, a natural Pacer, Ham dock'd, but not branded plain enough to be perceived. The Owner may have her of me, paying as the Law directs.

John Hurst.

## Notes

This advertisement from the Virginia Gazette in 1755 is one of the earliest documented references to "Fall's Church" in Fairfax County, predating the American Revolution by over twenty years. The church referenced was likely The Falls Church, which was established as a wooden structure in 1733 and later rebuilt in brick in 1769. This indicates that the area was already known as "Falls Church" in local usage well before the community formally adopted the name.

The advertisement follows a common colonial format for lost or recovered livestock, with John Hurst following legal procedures to announce a found horse and offering its return to the rightful owner upon payment of fees as prescribed by colonial law.

Notable details include:
- The spelling "the Fall's Church" with the possessive apostrophe
- Reference to Fairfax County, which at that time was much larger than its current boundaries
- Detailed description of the horse using period terminology ("Ham dock'd" refers to the horse's tail being shortened or docked)

# Construction Advertisement for Brick Falls Church

## Transcription

To be LETT to the lowest BIDDER, on Thursday the 1st Day of January next, if fair, if not, the next fair Day, at the Falls Church in Fairfax County,

THE Building of two Brick Churches, one at the Place where the said Falls Church stands, the other in the Town of Alexandria, to contain Twenty Four Hundred square Feet each. The Walls to be of such a Heighth and Strength as to admit of Galleries.

Any Persons inclining to undertake the same, are desired to meet at the said Church with their Plans, for the Vestry to determine upon.

The Churchwardens will be enabled this ensuing Spring to advance to the Undertaker of each Church £. 200, or upwards, to enable them to carry on the Work, on giving Bond with Security.

WILLIAM ADAMS, } Churchwardens.
JOHN DALTON,   }

## Notes

This 1766 advertisement documents a pivotal moment in Falls Church history - the planned construction of the brick Falls Church building that stands to this day. The wooden structure built in 1733 was to be replaced by a more substantial brick church. This advertisement reveals several important historical details:

1. The church was already known as "Falls Church" by 1766
2. The construction was to be awarded through a competitive bidding process
3. The identical brick church in Alexandria was likely Christ Church 
4. William Adams and John Dalton served as churchwardens
5. The building specifications called for 2,400 square feet with galleries
6. The vestry had significant funding (£200) to advance for construction

This document is particularly significant as it relates to the brick church that was completed in 1769, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. George Washington is believed to have served as a vestryman of Truro Parish during this time period, and may have been involved in the planning and oversight of this construction project. After completion, this building would become an important landmark during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.

# Falls Church: History of a Virginia Village

## Source Information
Author: Tony P. Wrenn
Date: December 1971

## Description
This document preserves the content of Tony P. Wrenn's historical work "Falls Church: History of a Virginia Village," which chronicles the development and evolution of Falls Church from its early settlement to its modern incarnation as a distinct Virginia community.

## Content

### INTRODUCTION

The name Falls Church derives naturally from a geographic phenomena and from a man-made structure. Located on the line between Tidewater and Piedmont Virginia, the town is near both the Great Falls and the Little Falls of the Potomac River.

The Potomac below Little Falls is tidal - above Little Falls it is beyond the reach of the tides. Since the falls were a barrier both to river navigation and overland transportation, early habitation of the area and a series of trails around the falls were a natural development.

English settlement of the area, beginning in the seventeenth century, brought with it here, as elsewhere, the established Church of England. The contract for the first church in the present city was let in 1733 and completed by October 1734. The present church, begun in 1767, was completed two years later. The church was called the "New Church" until 1746 when another church was built on Rocky Run. That then became the "New Church" and the church at the falls the "Upper Church." After 1757 it is usually referred to as "The Falls Church."

Just as it was natural that the church should take its name from the geographic features which created the need for a settlement at that particular point, it followed that the town which grew up around the church should be called after it. When the village was incorporated by Act of the Legislature on March 30, 1875, it became officially "The Town of Falls Church." Falls Church remained a town until shortly after World War II, when it became an independent city.

To a large extent the history of Falls Church is a history of transportation in Northern Virginia. Indian trails led to settlers' roads. These became rolling roads, and finally turnpikes. In the mid-nineteenth century the railroad pushed track through Falls Church, and shortly before the end of that century, the electric trolley arrived. New settlers, business and growth followed closely behind each improvement in the transportation system. With the unfortunate death of the trolley system in the mid-twentieth century, and the railroad somewhat later, the highways which had succeeded the trails and turnpikes were left to bear the brunt of ever increasing business and growth, so that many of the problems of the present city may also be traced to transportation.

Like other towns, Falls Church did not exist in a vacuum, but was shaped by its neighbors and by events in surrounding areas. The formation of Truro Parish; the establishment of Fairfax County and its county seat near The Falls Church; the establishment of the District of Columbia and the moving of the Federal Government to Washington; the retrocession of Alexandria County from the District to the State of Virginia; the location of Falls Church in a Civil War no-man's land; the establishment of Arlington County; and the growing suburbs of Washington all played a part in Falls Church history and all are covered here to some extent.

In 1971 Falls Church retains a healthy mix of historical background, three-dimensional historical remains, and ongoing development. These give the city a sense of continuity and of community. The intent of this study is to add to and buttress that mix - not simply to recount the past of a town, but to give it a sense of time and place by linking it to history which survives in streets and areas and buildings and people.

Insofar as possible, we have allowed the contemporary records to tell their own story, believing that in that manner the flavor and feel of the history of Falls Church can best be recaptured.

### PRE-EUROPEAN HISTORY TO THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

Prior to the arrival of the Englishman John Smith, in 1608, no European is known to have seen the territory which makes up Falls Church. In that year Smith sailed up the Potomac as far as the "marshes," or Falls. Smith was received variously with either warmth or hostility along the River and at several places ventured inward along the paths and trails of the Indians.

The Indians Smith met in the area of Falls Church were probably Algonquins, titular members of the Powhatan Confederacy. There were Siouxan tribes in the area as well, especially the Manahoac, normally to the north and west of the Falls, while the Algonquins, particularly the Doags, were to the south and east. The territories certainly overlapped, and both tribes ranged through the general area. At least one permanent Indian campsite is thought to have been located within present day Falls Church, on the Crossman Farm, at Lee Highway and Columbia Street.

Though the Indians who occupied the area were small in number, their use of the area around the Falls was intense, and just as streets in Boston, Massachusetts, are said to have followed the cow-paths made by early settlers' cattle, much of the transportation system in Northern Virginia followed the early paths and trails of the Indians. Fairfax Harrison suggests that:

"He who takes his imagination with him over the roads of Old Prince William will warm to a romantic story. Consider what these roads have known. Long before the white man came, there were frequented forest trails leading through the heart of the territory from those natural northern gateways which we call Noland's Ferry, Snicker's Gap, and Ashby's Bent. We all remember that Confederate and Yankee generals once stood on the saddle of the Blue Ridge beneath the giant poplar tree which long marked the county boundary in the last mentioned of those gateways, but we do not all perhaps realize that when that tree was a sapling the buffalo made his way thither seeking the pastures of the Shenandoah. During the mid-seventeenth century the Susquehannock Indians, crossing the Potomac at the mouth of the Monocacy, came hither to establish a plain path all the way across Virginia to the Yadkin villages, where they traded for skins on behalf of the Dutch at Manhattan. Later, and for half a century, the trails the buffalo and the Susquehannocks had opened were the familiar haunts of the far journeying Iroquois, ever extending the sphere of influence of their famous Long House into the South. As these Indian trails gradually became roads, they felt the moccasin-shod foot of the earliest pioneer pushing north into the bluegrass lands of the hills..."

At least one of the Indian trails which played a prominent part in opening the Falls Church area to settlement was the path running from just below Alexandria to Vestal's [Snicker's] Gap. Known by various names during the occupancy of the Europeans, it ultimately came to be known as the Leesburg Pike in the nineteenth century, but it was traveled and described by Europeans as early as 1699. Within present day Falls Church it was met by another trail which led from the Little Falls. The street following the old path still bears the name Little Falls.

These trails could not be adequately exploited by the European settlers until the Indians had been subdued. Pacification came in the Falls Church area with the "Susquehannock War" in 1675-77, after which the Iroquois gradually moved to the north.

Even before this, however, the English colonists were already planning for the use of the Falls Church area and including it in governmental units, though these meant little in terms of settlement of the area until after the close of the seventeenth century. Northumberland County, whose indefinite boundaries stretched northward to the Falls Church area, was formed in 1648. Northumberland was further divided, and ultimately in 1664 Stafford County was created, covering all of present Northern Virginia.

Concurrently with the formation of Northumberland County all of the Northern Neck, including roughly everything between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, was granted in proprietorship by Charles II to seven of his followers - The Proprietors of the Northern Neck. After a series of disputes, misunderstandings, and legal maneuvers, Lord Culpeper finally gained undisputed proprietorship to the Northern Neck in 1688, possession of which through the marriage of his daughter, passed to Lord Fairfax in the eighteenth century.

There seems little doubt that the policy by which land was granted inhibited the development of the area. Robert Carter complained in 1695 that in such grants there was no:

"...lapsing for want of seating...for in the conveyances of the said proprietors there is not any limitation upon that accounte, and accordingly a man may hold 50,000 or more acres by a secure title and that without so much as actually seating or building on any part of it."

It was only as the great grants were built or settled upon by their owners and broken up that the ordinary settler, of modest means and seeking small acreage, came to this area and a settlement pattern began to take shape. In general that process did not begin until well into the eighteenth century, but before 1700 at least one settler may have built a permanent shelter in Falls Church. The house he built, known as Big Chimneys, stood off South Maple Avenue near W. Broad Street until the twentieth century. Over the years it served multiple uses, the two major ones being residence and ordinary. A marker, high in one of the massive stone chimneys which gave the house its name, is said to have been carved with the date "1699." Whether Big Chimneys was built before 1700 or not, it was probably the first permanent structure in Falls Church built by a European.

### THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND THE FALLS CHURCH

In colonial Virginia the governmental unit often preceded the settlers who followed. As the settlers belonged to the Church of England and a new parish was created. As the parish was peopled, a new governmental unit followed. With the spread of settlers into the Northern Neck, the governmental units controlling them became progressively smaller in land area and Prince William County was created from Stafford in 1731.

One year later Truro Parish was created covering all of the upper reaches of Prince William County - roughly everything between the Occoquan River and Bull Run, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Potomac River.

On Saturday, June 19, 1742, the Governor and Council:

"ORDERED that the Court-house for Fairfax County be appointed at a place called Springfield situated between the New Church [Falls Church] and Ox Road in the old Road that goes from the New Church to Ox Road near where the Road from the Little Falls joins the said Old Road between Hunting Creek and Difficult Run..."

Chosen because it was near the center of the projected settlement patterns of the new county, the court house site had to be carved out of the wilderness, an unsatisfactory arrangement so that it was later moved to Alexandria, and ultimately at the end of the eighteenth century to Fairfax where it remains today.

The founding of Alexandria had made the move to that city in 1754 a logical one, while the inclusion of Alexandria in the Federal District of Columbia and the assumption of control of Alexandria by the District of Columbia in 1800 required the move to Fairfax. In its first location, near the intersection of Routes 7 and 123, much of the religious and social life which would normally have centered around the county offices actually revolved around The Falls Church instead. This was the nearest establishment of the Church of England, and the building of a court house nearby brought more settlement to the church than it did to the court house itself. The courts and the church were the two nuclei around which eighteenth century life in Virginia revolved, and the church had already been in existence some ten years when the court house was built, so it was the logical center of growth.

The new Parish soon authorized the construction of new houses of worship. One of these was the first Falls Church authorized in 1733. On June 9 of that year the contract for construction was let to Richard Blackburn who:

"...agreed with this Vestry to build a church at the crossroads near Michael Reagans in this parish of the following dimensions, viz: 40 feet in length, 22 feet wide and 13 feet pitch, to be weather boarded, covered, and all the inside work performed and done after the same manner the work on Occoquan Church is done."

By 1734 the church had been completed and on April 12, 1737:

"John Summers... agreed with this Vestry to pail in the yard about the new church after the same manner the yard about the Church at Pohick is pailed in, only the pails to be sawed, to make good and sufficient shutters for the windows of the said church, and to make and erect two good and substantial horse blocks."

With the actual building of the church the development pattern of the community was in effect established. The church brought new settlers to the crossroads and remained the center of the village for the rest of the eighteenth century.

In 1742, Fairfax County was formed from Prince William, covering what is today Arlington, Loudoun, and Fairfax counties, and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church.

By the middle of the century there were probably several dwellings near the church, though none of them now exist. Shortly after that time the church structure, known first at the "New Church" then as the "Upper Church", came to be known as The Falls Church. That name first appears in the Vestry Book on November 28, 1757, and after that is used consistently for "the church at the crossroads near Michael Reagans," or the "Upper Church."

Within thirty years of the construction of the first church, it was already in disrepair, and the site was being questioned.

"At a Vestry for Truro Parish held at the Falls Church March 28, 1763. Present: Henry Gunnel, Wm. Payne, Jun. Church Wardens; William Payne, Chas. Broadwater, Thos. Wren, Abraham Barnes, Dan McCarty, Robert Boggess and George Washington, Gentlemen, Vestrymen, who being there met to examine into the state of the said church, viz: whether it was in need of repairs and likewise whether the same should be repaired or a new one built, whether at the same place or removed to a more convenient one. Resolved, it is the opinion of this Vestry that the old Church is rotten and unfit for repair, but that a new Church be built at the same place."

This meeting at The Falls Church was the first vestry attended by George Washington, who had replaced William Peake on the Truro Vestry in 1762. The meeting was marked not only by Washington's initiation to the Vestry, but by two momentous decisions for the future town. The first of these was the decision to build a new church, but the second and more important, was to build it on the same site. Shortly after, in 1765, Truro Parish was divided once more, and The Falls Church and the congregation in Alexandria became part of Fairfax Parish, where both remained until the twentieth century when separate parishes were created for each.

James Wren of Falls Church was appointed to the Vestry on November 15, 1766, and at the January 1, 1767, meeting submitted a plan for the new church structure at Falls Church which he not only designed but proposed to build as well. The Vestry had ordered the advertising of two brick churches, one at Falls Church and one at Alexandria. The undertakers were to meet at The Falls Church on January 1, 1767 "and bring in their plans." At the meeting the plan submitted by Wren "was made choice of" for both churches.

Little is known of Wren's early life and training. He was born about 1728, and died at Long View, near Falls Church, in 1818 [now 2606 Ogden Street]. He established a home on the tract known as Winter Hill, and built his house and a tavern in the 300 block of East Broad Street. Wren's became one of the best known taverns in this part of Virginia. Though Winter Hill has disappeared, the Birch House, 312 East Broad Street, one of the early buildings on the Winter Hill tract, still survives.

Wren was evidently a carpenter and joiner for several records of binding apprentices to him exist. On October 2, 1755, Thomas Wren was apprenticed to him to learn the trade, and on April 7, 1763, John Wren apprenticed himself to James for the same reason. Evidently he was already well established in the trade before he was appointed to the Vestry, and must have already gained some renown as a carpenter. His designs for the Falls Church, Christ Church in Alexandria, and the Pohick Church reveal a knowledge of style and symmetry unusual for a carpenter in mid-eighteenth century Virginia, and few others have as many surviving buildings of merit. Wren must have owned architectural style books and probably had studied other structures in the area. He was married in Stafford County in 1753, probably at Aquia Church, which had been built two years earlier. There are many similarities in finish between Aquia and the three churches we know Wren to have designed, so that if he did not actually work on that church, he certainly knew it and learned from it. There is no question of his design of the other three churches however.

Specifications for Wren's Alexandria and Falls Church structures, adopted at the January 1767 meeting, stated:

"The churches at the Falls and Alexandria to be 28 feet from the foundation, that is 3 bricks and a half to the sleepers, 3 bricks to the water table and two and one half from thence. The quoins and arches to be rubbed brick; the pediments to the doors rubbed in the Tuscan order."

The specifications further enumerate type and style of windows, hardware, a cove ceiling, and an altar piece, pulpit and canopy to be finished in the Ionic order.

Evidently, in addition to designing the church and supervising its construction, Wren made the brick as well. The clay pits and kiln still could be seen as late as 1940, about 300 yards from the church on the Old Fairfax Road.

The structure must have been sufficiently completed for use by December 20, 1769, for at a meeting on that date, the building was accepted by the Vestry. Decoration of the interior continued, however. George Washington gave one pound toward that end in March, 1770, and in May Wren submitted a bill of eight pounds for "writing the commandments and making a table for the communion."

Work on a new glebe house was completed in 1775, just in time to witness the beginning of the Revolutionary War. In October 1776, the first Virginia General Assembly held after the Declaration of July 4 in Philadelphia, exempted:

"The different Societies of Dissenters from contributing to the support and maintenance of the church as by law established."

The Anglican church never again enjoyed the exclusive financial support of the citizenry, and in the years following it suffered losses in actual support as well. The gradual decline begun at this time was not to be reversed until the nineteenth century, though the church was not totally separated from the state until 1784.45 That year the Vestry was relieved of its responsibility to care for the poor and for orphans. Provisions were made for the election of overseers of the poor instead, though the Vestry and minister of the church were recognized as a corporation capable of holding church property and administering church affairs. In the future, Vestries were to be elected by the church members rather than by all housekeepers and tax payers in the parish.

Not a great deal of information exists on Falls Church during the Revolutionary War. George Washington continued to serve on the Vestry during the period, and did not resign until after the War was over, in 1784. Charles Broadwater is said to have used the church structure as a recruiting station for Revolutionary soldiers. 46

Broadwater was certainly one of the most colorful citizens of eighteenth century Falls Church. He had been a Sheriff in Fairfax County, an officer in the Virginia Militia in the French and Indian Wars, and a Vestryman of Fairfax Parish. 47 He had advanced to the rank of Colonel by the time of the Revolution.

At a meeting of the freeholders of Fairfax County on July 18, 1774, Broadwater and George Washington lately elected. . .Representatives to serve in the General Assembly," (were) directed to attend the Convention at Williamsburg on August 1st, and present me fangun written by Colonel George Mason. 48

On May 15, 1776, with the same Charles Broadwater and John West, Jr., also a member of the Vestry, representing Fairfax County, a Virginia Convention voted unanimously to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia to seek a Declaration of Independence.

In the summer of 1776, the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the Congress in July, was read to the citizens from The Falls Church as it was from many other churches following its adoption. 49 The immediate area around the church seems to have weathered the rest of the War and the era of the confederacy in relative quietude. But whatever matters influenced the life and thinking of the citizens of the Falls Church area between the Revolution and 1790, the next decade was dominated by the establishment of the national capital.

The Act which led to the establishment of the District of Columbia on the banks of the Potomac, and on land ceded by the states of Virginia and Maryland, was presented to President Washington for signature on July 12, 1790. 50 Washington immediately took up the question of sites, and in January 1791 chose the present site for the capital. The new city was to be ten square miles, and Andrew Ellicott was retained to survey the site, while Pierre Charles L'Enfant was chosen to lay out the city. 51 Ellicott and his surveyors worked their way through the countryside, setting stone markers at the corners of the district and on a straight line between.

On June 26, 1791, Ellicott wrote, from "Surveyor Camp, State of Virginia," "The country through which we are now cutting one of the ten mile lines is very poor. I think for near seven miles, on it there; not one house that has any floor except the earth, and what more strange it is in the neighborhood of Alexandria and Georgetown. We find but little fruit, except huckleberries, and live in a Camp as retired as we used to do on Lake Erie. Labouring hands in this country can scarcely be had at any rate, my estimate was twenty - but I have had to wade slowly through with six, this scarcity of hands will lengthen out the time much beyond what intended. As the President is so much attached to this Country, I would not be willing that he should know my real sentiments about it. . .This country intended for the permanent residence of Congress, bears no more proportion to the country about Philadelphia and Germantown, for either wealth or fertility, than a crane goes to a stork."

The western corner of the new district was established near the intersection of present day Meridian and West Streets. The stone still exists in a small part jointly maintained by the jurisdictions whose boundaries it marks today - Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the City of Falls Church. One other Falls Church stone also survives. This is the number nine, or Greenough stone, which can still be seen at Van Buren Street and Four Mile Run on the border between Arlington County and Falls Church.

When L'Enfant laid out his magnificent city with streets 100 to 110 feet wide, avenues 160 feet wide, and a ceremonial avenue 400 feet wide, 52 all was located to the north of the Potomac, and away from the site of Falls Church. He thus set into motion a chain of events which ultimately established the northeastern boundary of present day Falls Church, and eventually led to the retrocession of the District land on the Virginia side of the Potomac to the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Jonathan Lovett's survey of the roads between Winchester and Alexandria, completed in 1801. One road is through Centreville and Ashby's Gap, and the other through Falls Church and Leesburg.

Lovett chose as his reference point in the village not the church but Col. James Wren's.

Col.
Wren's Tavern was on the Leesburg road 312 East Broad Street] and Lovett's table of distances lists it as
66 miles, 2 quarters, 36½ perches from Winchester,
"4 miles, 2 quarters, 52 perches"
from the Old Court House.
and "7 miles, 3 quarters, 111 perches" from Alexandria. The tavern
was a well known hostelry in 1801. Thomas Jefferson had stayed there, and recommended it to others. In an April 30, 1801 letter to James Madison on the condition of the roads through Fairlax County, Jetterson noted that he had consulted with Colonel Wren, who knows both roads, he says there is no comparison, that you must absolutely come by Fairtax courthouse, all that road being practicable until you come to Little s lane, which you have to encounter whatever way you come. lefferson recommended that Madison start as soon as vou can see to drive breakrast at colonel Wren's and come on here [Washington] to dinner."

Madison and other members of his government
also used the Tavern during the War of 1812 when they led the British burning of

The Falls Bridge, later known as Chain Bridge, had been opened to business in 1797,01 and a number of Tumpike Companies were formed in the area, spurred largely by local needs. It was the War of 1812, how-ever, and the attendant difficulty experienced by the Government in the movement of troops and supplies which provided the real spur to road building.
When the British advanced on Washington in 1814 and burned the President's House [White House] and other buildings, the escape route for fleeing President James Madison and other dignitaries was through Falls Church. In addition, important supplies and documents either passed through the town or were stored in the area.

his name on the records. This made it necessary for each voting resident to become publicly either a union or a secession supporter. In some precincts in Fairfax County, union supporters voted to reject secession, then, seeing that the vote was against them, had their vote changed to the secession column. 84 In the County, 1,231 men went to the polls 942 of them voted for secession, while 289 voted against - almost a fourth of those voting.
Fort Marcy [still extant] was one of several earthwork forts to be constructed in a semicircle around Washington, from Falls Church on the north to Alex andria on the south, forming the southern defenses of Washington. Fort Buffalo at the present Seven Corners has disappeared, but there are still remains of the Fort Taylor earthworks in an overgrown area adjacent to Oakwood Cemetery at Roosevelt and East Broad Streets.
In Falls Church precinct no votes were changed and the results were somewhat different. Approximately a third of the voters, 26 out of 70, wished to remain with the Union. Included among them was William A.
Blaisdale, the owner of Cherry Hill. Joining him were
W. H. and Andrew Ellison and Dr. Samuel Groot.
Among the 44 voting for secession were William and
B. F. Shreve, George Minor, H. H. Darne, and Lisander, Charles, and Albert Wren. In the West and Dulany families there were sharp divisions with members voting on both sides.
J. G. Barnard, who had participated in constructing the defenses and who had been hastily called to Washington in 1864 when General Jubal Early's Confederate troops threatened the city, noted in his later report that

Among the many who came to the village during the War, probably no one is today better known than Matthew Brady. A fashionable Washington photographer when the War began, he came to Falls Church at least twice in 1861-62, probably looking much as he did when Margaret Leech described him on his way to Manassas in July of 1861:
lugging his huge camera and plateholder. He was a bushy-haired little Irishman, with a pointed beard and big nose, and he wore a long, light duster and a straw hat.

The town charter had been amended in 1879 and

and the County was fixed at that time, with the retrocession of a large group of voters to Fairfax County.
Dr. E. B. Henderson moved to Falls Church in 1910, when there were still vivid memories of the reasons for that transfer. Dr. Henderson had become director of health and physical education in the Negro schools of the District of Columbia in 1904, a post he held for fifty years, and had moved to Falls Church where his wife was already a teacher. In a 1965 oral history session Dr. Henderson noted that
Relations between the two major racial groups in Falls Church have always been very good, but an interesting occurence came several years after the town was organized. There existed in those davs a real two party system. Many of the settlers from the north were Republicans and all the Negroes were Republicans. All the southerners were Democrats and they were the dominant party in Falls Church. To improve the political situation, the colored section was cut off from the town to remain in Fairfax County.
It was not an unusual practice. It was just a simple case of gerrymandering.111a
It was in this era, in 1897, that the trolley line of the Washington-Virginia Railway Company, later known as the Washington, Arlington, and Falls Church line reached Fails Church 112 When combined with the railroad, it offered fast and efficient service to Lees-burg, Alexandria, Fairfax, Washington and scores of intermediate points. These two life lines, the trolley and the railroad, became the dominant forces in shaping the future growth and events of the town.
This transportation system, together with the amenities of the town, and available land, led to its selection for Camp Russell A. Alger, established just outside Falls Church during the Spanish-American War.
Congress had declared war on Spain April 21, 1898, and troops began to assemble at Falls Church. Charles
A. Stewart, in a contemporary account, described the effect of Camp Alger on Falls Church.


## Historical Context
Tony P. Wrenn's work represents a significant contribution to documenting the history of Falls Church. The study likely examines the transition of Falls Church from rural crossroads to established village to suburban community, tracking its growth alongside the development of Northern Virginia and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

# Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside

## Source Information
This document captures content from "Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside," which appears to be a historical account of Falls Church focusing on the personal and community aspects of its development.

## Description
"Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside" explores the more intimate side of Falls Church history, focusing on the families, homes, and daily life that shaped the community. As suggested by the title, the work likely emphasizes the domestic and social aspects of Falls Church's development - the stories shared by neighbors across fences and within homes around firesides.

Other nearby camps included Nameroughquena, across the old Long Bridge from Washington, and Assomeck, below Alexandria. Also near Alexandria was a camp called Namasingakeut. The powerful Dogs and Sus-quehannocks who roamed in this area, probably vied for these sites as a base for their hunting and trading expeditions. One tribe operated an extensive soapstone quarry at Falls Church.?

In recent years bones have been found indicating that some of the terrible Susquehannocks may have been eight feet in height. Smith commented that the local Indians had broad noses flat and full at the ends, and had "great bigg lippes, and wyde mouthes..." He says the Patawomeck Indians camped along the Potomac.
In 1675, the Indian problem came to a climax in the "Susquehannock War." Following this, the procession of local settlers increased. Previously, the Virginia and Maryland sides of the Potomac suffered greatly from Indian aggression. The local Indians crossed the Potomac to attack the settlers in 1675, beginning a war of typical guerilla tactics, including theft and depredation 3
For about a year or more the war was fought in a desultory manner in Virginia and Maryland, with the result that the Indians were permanently driven from the area. A first hand account of the war is to be found in a letter, dated July 13, 1705. from Thomas Matthews (Burgess from Stafford County) to the Honorable Robert Harley, Esquire. English Secretary of
State
In his letter Matthews wrote that "About the year 1675, appear'd three prodigies in that country, which from th' attending disasters, were looked upon as ominous presages." He then speaks of a comet "streaming like a horse taile westwards" every evening for a week, and "fflights of pigeons in breadth nigh a quarter of the midhemisphere, and of their length was no visible end.
" This sight put the "planters under the more portentious
apprehensions, because the like was seen (as they said in the vear 1640 when the Indians committed the last massacre, but not after, untill that present year 1675." The third of the "prodigies" was swarms of "flyes about an inch long, and big as the top of a man's little finger, rising out of spigot holes in the earth, which eat the new sprouted leaves from the top of the trees without other harm, and in a month left us."
rietor gave him one hundred acres of land (one hundred acres more for the migrant's wife, and fifty acres for each child). If a person could recruit five or more additional immigrants, he was given two thousand acres. Any one who acquired one thousand acres in Maryland was entitled to become Lord of a Manor" with feudal rights. In Virginia, "King™ Robert Carter owned three hundred thousand acres. William Fitzhugh owned fifty thousand acres of land. The large majority settled on smaller tracts, and these included artisans and small farmers.

Towns did not grow up, although some small trading posts did. Each plantation was a self-contained unit. Life centered about the plantation, where the planter in his mansion, surrounded by his family and retainers, was a patriarch mildly ruling and entertaining every one. It was the life of the fam ily and not of the great world, and produced that intense attachment to the soil which is a characteristic of Virginians to this day. The public or political character of Virginians corresponded to their private one, haughty and jealous of their liberties, impatient of restraint, symbolized in men such as Mason, Jefferson, Washington, and a host of others.

The land was originally covered with virgin timber except for meadows and corn fields used by the Indians. The forests were sacrificed for tobacco culture. By 1635. tobacco cultivation had become one of the most profitable enterprises in Virginia. The expanding European market assured the planters of a steady demand for all that they could produce.

On
The Road to The Falls
Els church is unique in at least one way. Iris the only Fals Church in the
United States. It was the name of a church before it was the name of a vil-lage; therefore the present city owes its existence to a church rather than to a store, court house, or landmark. It is fitting to give a history of the church to which the city is indebted. At the time the church, later called "Falls Church" was founded, there was nothing in this area except plantations and small farms, and here and there an occasional Ordinary (tavern). The road to the Little Falls of the Potomac was intersected by the road from Alexandria to Leesburg, once known as Middle Turnpike, and now known as Leesburg Pike (Broad Street). It was at this crossroads "on the road to Little Falls* and about three miles distant, that the Falls Church was built In 1730 Prince William County was taken from Stafford County, above Chappawamsick Creek and Deep Run, and along the Potomac River, to the
"Great Mountains." This became known as the Hamilton Parish boundary when that parish was created. By an Act of the General Assembly, May, 1732, Hamilton Parish was divided, effective the following November, into two parishes. One of them was marked or bounded "By the river Ockoquan, and the Bull Run, (a branch thereof,) and a course from thence to the Indian Thoroughfare of the Blue Ridge Mountains." (Indian Thoroughfare was later Ashby's Gap.) That portion which remained in Prince William retained the name of Hamilton Parish, "and all that other part of the said county, which lies above those bounds, shall hereafter be called and known by the name of Truro." Truro Parish was later divided into smaller parishes, which include the Parishes of Cameron, Fairfax, Shelburne (all instituted in colonial days) and the later Parishes of Johns, Upper Truro, McGill, and a portion of Meade. Truro Parish was named for the ancient parish of that name in Corn-wall, England.
Truro Parish was instituted by Act of the Assembly which provided that the sheriff of the County should summon the freeholders and housekeepers to meet and to elect so many of "most able and discreet persons in the said
Parish as shall make up the number of Vestrymen in the said Parish twelve

JoviE most abl and discreet persons" were elected: Charles Broadwater, John Lewis, Rich. ard Osborn, Gabriei Adams. and Edward EmmSohn Herytord, An st atos that anese men together with Dennis MoCarty, John I superriband Edwary Barry, having taken the oaths appointed by Law, and Subscribed to be con.
Barm'ble to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, took their
places in the Vestry accordingly.
aces first vestry meeting was held on November 7. 1732, at which time Edward Barry was nominated and elected derk. John Heryford and Edward
Emms were chosen churchwardens for the next year, and were
"sworn ac
cordingly." The vestry book here begins for the first time, with recitation of the Act of the Assembly instituting the parish. The second meeting was held March 26. 1733, and at that time John Sturman and Giles Tillett were added to the vestry, and also listed are the names of Francis Awbrey (of Awbrey's Ferry) and William Godfrey, not previously mentioned. At this meeting it was decided to build the first Falls Church: "Ordered that the Churchwardens give publick notice to workmen to appear at the next Vestry to be held for this parish to agree for the building of a church at the cross roads near Michael Reagans in this parish."
At the meeting held April 16, 1733, Michael Ashford was declared on oath a vestryman of the parish and "subscribed to the test." At this time an agree ment was made with the Reverend Lawrence DeButts to preach three times a month for one year, "at Occoquan Church, the new Church, or William Gunnell's. (Falls Church) and at the Chappell above Goose Creek for the sum of eight thousand pounds of tobacco clear of the Warehouse charge and abatements, -And the said DeButts doth further agree to and with the Vestry aforesaid, that in case he fails, or is by the weather prevented to preach at any of the places aforesaid, any of the times aforesaid, tobacco shall only be levied for him in proportion to his service." Mr. DeButts preached eight sermons for the parish during the year assigned him, and received 1,970 Is, of tobacco. He moved to Maryland at the end of the year.
The first Falls Church congregation to which DeButts ministered, seems to have been established through the efforts of William Gunnell. Gunnell was a native of Westmoreland County, and settled in what is now Falls Church in 1729. In that year he was issued two patents of land, one for four hundred and the other for two-hundred fifty acres, to border on Four Mile Run. A portion of this land was just north of where the church was erected. and the second on the south side of the Run, adjoining Thomas Pearson's patent on the west. In the spring of 1730. Gunnell applied to James Keith a minister of Hamilton Parish, to serve the congregation he had established in his home, consisting of Thomas Pearson, Michael Reagan, and others.
Services were held occasionally by Mr. Keith, and the congregation became known as "William Gunnell's Church." Mr. Keith served until the coming d Mr. DeButts in 1733, and received 10,544 pounds of tobacco for his services Keith was a colorful figure and was the maternal grandfather of Chief Justif John Marshall.
From 1733 (building of the first church) until 1765-69 (building of the present brick church) the history is often confusing owing to a difference of name for the church. First appearing as William Gunnell's Church," it was known after 1733 and until about 1757 as Upper Church," to distinguish it from the "Lower Church" of the parish (or "Occoquan Church," the original Pohick Church). At the time that Truro Parish was created from Hamilton Parish, the small beginnings of these two congregations
were
already in existence, as was the congregation of the "Chappell above Goose Creek," (near the Big Spring on the road to Point of Rocks outside of Lees-burg in Loudoun Count.)
The records concerning the first Falls Church, a wooden building, are given in the vestry book. On June 9, 1733, Colonel Richard Blackburn agreed with the Vestry of Truro Parish (consisting of John Sturman, Dennis McCarty.
Michael Ashford, William Godfrey, Giles Tillett, Gabriel Adams, Edward Barry, John Hereford and Edward Emms) to build this first Falls Church:
Whereas Mr. Richard Blackburn has this day agreed with this Vestry fo build a Church at the Cross roads near Michael Reagans in this Parish of the following dimentions; Vizt: Forty feet in length, two and twenty foot wide, and thirteen foot pitch, to be weather boarded.
Covered, and all the inside work perform'd and done after the same manner the work upon Oddduid Pohick Church is. done, for the sum of thirty three thousand five hundred pounds of tobacco.
William Godfrey and Michael Ashford were "to take care that the work upon the church be well and sufficiently done and performed." Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman in his George Washington (Vol. 1, page 54) gives the above quotation from the Vestry Book and states: "It is quite probable, though it cannot be stated positively, that this was the first church ever attended by George Washington."
Michael Reagan gave the land for the Falls Church, but failed to give a deed to the Vestry. He later sold his property to John Trammell. On March 20, 1746, by deed recorded in the Fairfax Court House, John Trammell transferred "by deed of bargain and sale to the Vestry of Truro Parish in Fairfax County" a certain parcel of land containing two acres "where the Upper Church now is, to be laid off in such manner as the Vestry shall think proper, to include the said Church church-yard, and spring, and all appurtenances to the said premises." Trammell received fifty shillings sterling for the land.
The name Falls Church first appears in the old Vestry Book on November 28, 1757, when John Lumley, Clerk at "Falls Church" and Alexandria was ordered paid 2,000 lbs. of tobacco for his services. Prior to this entry the church was called "Upper Church." It is interesting to note that at one time the church mav have been referred to as "Little Falls Church." Bishop Meade refers to the church by this name.?
The contract awarded on June 9, 1733 is the earliest record concerning the building at Falls Church. By order of the vestry dated October 13, 1734,
John Trammell was paid 320 pounds of tobacco for "grubbing a place for a church." Under the same date, the Vestry ordered that Richard Blackburn be paid 16,750 pounds of tobacco "for his plans for building a church." and Joseph Johnson was ordered to "read at the chapels," for which he was to receive 1,300 pounds of tobacco. By this date the new building was at least partly in use. Another building was being constructed for the church at Goose Creek, and became known as "Goose Creek Chapel." On June 10. 1733, Capt. Francis Aubrey was paid 2,500 Ibs. of tobacco for building
the chapel.
Richard Blackburn, the architect of Falls Church, was a prominent Prince William resident, and a son of Col. Thomas Blackburn, an early settler.
His daughter, Julia Anne Blackburn, married Justice Bushrod Washington, who inherited Mount Vernon from General Washington. Jane Charlotte Blackburn, niece of Julia Anne (Blackburn) Washington, married John Augustine Washington, last private owner of Mount Vernon.
Colonel Richard Blackburn is noted in the records as a "builder of skill."
He designed the original house at Mount Vernon, now part of the present mansion. The Blackburn home, Rippon Lodge, built in 1725. and named for his ancestral home in Rippon, England, still stands today in what is now Prince William County, and is owned by a descendant, Richard Blackburn Black.
Rippon Lodge is a story-and half frame building with a gabled roof and three dormer windows. The dormer windows project over the balustraded roof of a recessed porch which has six small Doric columns. In the interior. the hall and dining room have richly carved paneling. In the upper hall is an aperture in the north wall which formerly led to a secret stairway. This stairway connected with a tunnel extending from the basement to a ravine.
In the yard is a brick office which Blackburn used, and a building called the guardhouse with iron-grilled windows. In this structure Thomas Blackburn quartered soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
The Reverend Charles Green was the first resident clergyman appointed to the Falls Church and the other churches of the parish. He was settled in 1737 and served until 1764. Green is of special interest because of numerous marginal notes which he made in the Vestry Book. Dr. Green was recom mended to the Vestry by Captain Augustine Washington. The following is the Vestry Record of August 19, 1736:
At a Vestry held for Truro Parish this 19th. day of August, 1736, present: Jeremiah Bronaugh, Church Warden; Dennis McCarty, Augustine Washington, Richard Osborn, John Sturman,
Wm.
Godfrey, James Baxter, Edward Barry, and Thomas Lewis, Vestry-men. Mr. Charles Green, being recommended to this Vestry by Capt. Augustine Washington as a person qualified to officiate as a Minister of this Parish, as soon as he shall receive orders from his Grace the Bishop of London to qualify himself for the same.
It is therefore orderedby this Vestry, that as soon as the said Green
The following names are of the first Vestry of Fairfax Parish: John West, Charles Alexander, William Payne, John Dalton, George Washington, Charles Broadwater, George Johnston, Townsend Dade, Richard Sanford, William Adams, John Posey, and Daniel French. The life of the new parish after the first division was but four months.
There is no evidence that the Vestry ever met for organization. The revision of the parish boundaries having taken place in May, Washington was elected a Vestryman of Truro Parish again in July. The Falls Church and the church at Alexandria (Christ Church) fell within the bounds of the new parish, where thev remain to this day. It was left to the Vestry of Fairfax Parish to complete the new edifice at Falls Church, which was done by 1769.
Details concerning the completion of the church are found in both Vestry Books. On February 3rd and 4th, 1766, at the home of William Gardner (at which time Washington was present) the following was recorded: "It appearing from an order of the Vestry bearing date the 25th day of March 1763 that there was a deficiency in the work which ought to have been done to the Falls Church by Mr. Chas. Broadwater and that persons were appointed to view the same and report and no report appearing upon the records of this parish it is ordered that the Church Wardens do inquire into the same and report accordingly."
Again, on July 10, 1766:
"At a Vestry held for Truro Parish, July 10, 1766, Mr. Edward Payne one of the Church Wardens having reported to this vestry that he had applied to the persons formally appointed to view the work which ought to have been done on the Falls Church by Mr. Chas. Broadwater and that they denied having any order to view the same and refused to concern themselves: Or-dered: That Thos. Price do view the work done to the Falls Church and report what deficiency appears in the same and that Mr. Edward Payne do apply to the vestry of Fairfax Parish to appoint a workman to view the same and that the said do report as aforesaid and that Mr. Edward Payne attend the viewing on behalf of this parish and to apply to the said vestry to appoint one of their members to attend the same on behalf of their parish." A meeting was held at the Glebe on February 23, 1767, (at which time George Washington was present). The following was reported: "A report being made to this vestry by Jas. Wren and Thos. Price two workmen empowered by a formal order of this vestry to view the work done to the Falls Church and to report what deficiency appeared in the same etc., by which report there appears to be a deficiency of 9 £ 14 s. 6 p. Ordered: That the Church Wardens of this parish apply to Maj. Chas. Broadwater the undertaker of said work for the sum and account with the vestry of Fairfax Parish for their proportion of the same when it is received. Ordered: That a vestry house be built at the new church.

The cost of building the Falls Church was £600. It was begun in 1761 and being complete. turned over to the Vestry in December, 1769. As 10 the materials used, Bishop Meade' writing during the 1850's states that the proportions of lime and sand in the mortar was the very reverse of the proportion of this day. and which accounts for the greater durability of al clent walls. The shingles were to be of the best Cypress or Juniper, and? warters of an inch thick, instead of our present half inch." Bishop Mead wrote. "A gallery never was erected in the Little Falls Church." However
the first building may have had a gallery. In 1740 three of the notables of the parsh asked permitits was to be or in lxcliste use of their families. west end of the church. This was to be for the exclusive use of their families.
The rector was one of the petitioners, though he signed "Charles Green.
Doctor of Physick."
There is a tradition that the bricks in the church walls were brought from England, and brick was often used as ballast. However, it is well known locally hat the bricks in the Falls Church were made by Colonel James Wren and William Wren, at their kiln. Although "bricks from England" is a pleasing radition, it is pointed out by numerous authorities that it is not altogether probable. Only a very few were imported by the colonies. Nearly everywhere
" Virginia can be found excellent deposits of brick clay, Thus the material was cheap and near at hand. The ships out of England were small, and every available inch of space was packed with manufactured and much-needed stems. The "bricks from England" theory in all probability came to popular thought by the fact that the trade phrases of the makers were "Dutch" and "English" style brick. The Wren kiln was about three-fourths of a mile east of what is now Dunn Loring, one block south of the W. & O.D. Railroad on Shreve Road.4
The Vestry ordered that George Washington pay to Alexander Henderson the sum of £8 being the balance of £ 9 - 14 s. 6 p. received from Maj. Chas.
Broadwater "for a deficiencv on the Falls Church." This was the conclusion of a drawn-out discussion. Washington's name appears less and less in the Vestry Book. On February 24, 1784 (in the same year that the civil functions of the Vestry ceased) it was reported: "At a vestry held for Truro Parish at Colchester the 22nd day of February 1784, John Gibson, gent., is elected for a member of this Parish in the room of his Excellency, General Washington who has signified his resignation in a letter to Dan'1. McCarty, Esq." The meeting of Fairfax Parish, held December 20, 1769, was attended by:
Townsend Dade, Church Warden; James Wren, Church Warden; William Payne, John Dalton, Charles Broadwater, Richard Sanford, William Adams, Daniel French, Edward Dulin, Thomas Shaw, and Henry Gunnell. "It is agreed by the Vestry that Mr. James Wren has completed the work on the Falls Church. agreeable to his contract and that his bond be delivered to him, and that they have received the same for the use of the parish. Ordered:
That Mr. James Wren and Townshend Dade do Allott the seats for the parishioners according to dignity. It is ordered that the old church be sold immediately and be removed by the last of February, a distance sufficient from the new building and the purchaser to give bond and security payable next June, come tweive months, and if it is not removed by that time that the Property be vested in the Parish again."
The old building which seems to have been in use right up to 1769, was sold to John Brawner for 7 pounds, 10 shillings. It stood somewhat southWest of the present building.S
The Vestry of Fairfax Parish met twenty-seven times between December
30. 1769 and March 24. 1771, and the business at hand was more or less

At the time of the First World War it was a common sight to see herd of cattle moving along the Leesburg Pike through Falls Church toward Washington. The largest slaughter house in this vicinity was at Rossi. and was conducted on a profitable basis for many years. Local farmers would arise about four o'clock in the morning, and, with four or five neighbos to help, would drive the cattle to be slaughtered. They arrived in Rossl about nine o'clock
Times have changed rapidly and all we see today to remind us of our once rural area is an occasional plow horse and wagon.
In early colonial times, the life of the colony centered around the parish church. Here the social and religious affairs of life were attended to. The location of a church was determined by a main road, and the location selecti was usuallv accessible to water. There were sometimes two or three churches in each parish, and an occasional "chapel of ease." The latter was located in a remote neighborhood and served from one of the churches. Church location was controlled by a desire to make the meeting place central. principal plantations, and the main road offered a carriage-way for the faith. ful. Once a neighborhood was selected, the exact location was determined by a good spring of water, as the parishioners came over hot and dusty roads in summer, and often man and beast refreshed themselves after traveling half the length of the county. The spring near "Big Chimneys" was convenien to the Falls Church

The name Middle Turnpike was applied becaus it lay between the Little River Turnpike, from Alexandria westward, an the Georgetown Turnpike, from Georgetown to Dranesville, where
the Georgetown Pike. It is interesting to note that the minutes of the Town Council of Falls Church, mentioned this as Middle Turnpike until that part of it within the town limits was named Broad Street. Broad Street has long been known locally as the Leesburg Pike.
Leesburg Pike (Route 7) is said to be one of the oldest roads in America in continuous use. It was originally an Indian trail about two hundred and thirty miles long, extending from Tidewater (in the vicinity of Williamsburg) to what were known as "the valleys beyond the mountains," or beyond the Blue Ridge. It passed through the counties of New Kent, King William, Caroline, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Prince William, crossing the Occoquan at Colchester into Fairfax. From Colchester it passed by way of Accotink, Washington's Old Mill, over the fords at Little Hunting Creek and at Great Hunting Creek, into Alexandria.
From Alexandria the Indian trail followed two routes, varying from one to twelve miles apart as the branches passed on their way to the mountains.
One of these passed through Fairfax County by Falls Church and Dranes-ville. through Loudoun County by Leesburg and Clark's Gap in the Catoctin Mountains and by Hillsboro to Key's Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
It was over this branch that General Sir Peter Halket's historic Forty-fourth Regiment of British Regulars, a part of General Braddock's army, marched, in April, 1755, on the disastrous expedition against the French and Indians.
The other part of this Indian trail passed from Alexandria through Fairfax one mile southwest of the present court house, through Loudoun County by Aldie near the Bull Run Mountains, to Snicker's Gap in the Blue Ridge.
A considerable extent of this branch is also known as Braddock's Road, 1 from the fact that a part of Braddock's wagon train passed over it.
It was over this road that George Washington and George William Fairfax journeyed to the Shenandoah Valley to survey the lands of Thomas, Lord Fairfax. In 1753, at the age of twenty-one, as a messenger from Governor Dinwiddie to the French Commander (with a commission of Colonel), Washington passed over it again on his route to Great Meadows.
Mr. J.O. Martin wrote of this road:
.. Dolley Madison, wife of the President, fled along this same road to Leesburg, when the British burned the White House at Washington, and over this same road was borne the body of Nellie Custis, George Washington's adopted daughter, who died in the Valley of Virginia, near Berryville, at an advanced age, and who was laid to rest at Mount Vernon." Miss Ada Walker wrote the author concerning Mrs. Madison's route:
*I was told that Dolley Madison fled over Chain Bridge, spent the night at Smoot's and went on from there to Leesburg Pike.
Leaving Langley Mrs. Madison went to Falls Church by Little Falls Road, according to a local tradition. It would seem out of the way for Mrs. Madison to have used the Little Falls Road, but it may be that this was the only road leading to the Pike that was not being searched. It is known that the old
"Big Chimneys" at Falls Church was searched by the British, since the President was thought to be there.

What is now known as Little Falls Street was once a tobacco or "Rolling Road." Little Falls Street in Falls Church was once part of the road to the Little Falls of the Potomac, and crossed the Leesburg Pike (Broad Street) about in front of the present day Odd Fellows Hall. The road meandered through the vacant field near the Bowling Alley. This road passed Big Chim-nevs Tavern, and connected with the road (Fairfax Street) beside the old Falls Church. Fairfax Street, often called "old back road," or by the more dignified "Courthouse Road," by older residents, passed, near Hillwood Avenue behind the old Birch home, connecting with Wilson Boulevard.
Great Falls Street, which intersects Little Falls Road in Falls Church, is another old road. A well-known local tradition, coming from several independent sources, maintains that George Washington surveyed this road as a route to the Potomac Canal
Shreve Road at West Falls Church follows a colonial access road which was used by the Wren, Darne, and Lindsay families. It was not until 1869, however, that it was laid off and under public control, although it was extended for public use as far as Backlick Road (now Lee Highway) below Mills Crossroads (Merrifield). Shreve Road was named for William Henry Shreve of "Mount Pleasant" (the old Lindsay home) who presented a petition to the Fairfax County Court in October, 1869: 12
Ifor] a county road from a point on the Middle Turnpike road about one fourth of a mile north of the crossing of the Alexandria Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad to a point on the road leading from Falls Church to Fairfax Court House and passing through the lands of Daniel H. Barrett, Lewis Sewall, Albert Wren, Elizabeth Wren, Robert Darne, and J.W. Gaylord, being about two and a half miles in length.
This petition was signed by William H. Shreve, J.C. DePutron, Archibald Sherwood, Seth Osborn, William H. Ellison, Charles H. Bramhall, Charles
VIEW IN FALLS VILLAGE, VA.
By the recent withdrawal of the Rebel Army, Falls Church has again come into our possession, and is now the headquarters as General Smith, who commandsone division of our army. On the advance of the National troops on the 29th of September, an un. fortunate collision took place between Baker's California regiment and Baxter's Pennsylvanians, each regiment mistaking the other an enemies. The error was not discovered until several volleys
had been fired, and many killed and wounded.
Another sketch on the same page is entitled "Panoramic View of the vi lage of Falls Church, Mason's Hill and the Surrounding Country. taken from the works now building by the National Troops on Munson's Hill." Given in this sketch is a view of the Union Troops erecting a new fort, Masons In this sked pickets. Rebel pickets attempting to shell General Wadsworths Headquarters, Falls Church, and the Rebel pickets on the ridge. All of this is listed under the picture. The following account (under "Illustrations'
tells of the Panoramic View:
PANORAMIC VIEW OF FALLS CHURCH AND THE SUR
ROUNDING SCENERY
Munson's Hill, which was occupied by the rebels in their recent advance, and imperfectly fortified by them, is now held by the National troops, who are engaged in entrenching it in a formidable manner. It commands a wide view to the southwest in the direction of Manassas, including Mason's Hill. the Village of Falls Church, and many other points which the events of the war have made famous.
The evacuation of Munson's Hill was an event of considerable importance to the U.S. Government. This can be seen in a letter written by a corres pondent to the Washington Star, dated from Munson's Hill, September 29, 1861 and appearing in that newspaper on the following day:
Your correspondent came up to this famous locality this afternoon, and found things much changed since his last visit, when the pickets on either side were industriously popping rifle-ball courtesies and sailets tons k cover in the corn fields. between this place. and Bailey's Cross Roads, three quarters of a mile distant. the road (Leesburg Turnpike) leading to the hill was lined with visitors in carriages, on horse-back, and on foot, pushing boldly along to get a close look at the much talked of eminence. Among the visitors just leaving as I arrived was Secretary Seward.
The New York Thirty-seventh regiment was in occupancy of the hill-at least such portion of the regiment as was not straggling or unis tee meishborhood committing depredations. The deeds
54
of this regiment (formerly MeCunn's) done on yesterday will
doubtless receive an investigation at the hands of Gen. McClel-lan. They were certainly of the most disgraceful character. Several dwellings, with barns and outhouses, were set on fire and wholly consumed. Amongst these was the house and barn of Rev.
Mr. Lipscomb. Valuable furniture, pianos, large mirrors, feather beds, etc., were destroyed wantonly, and in one instance the officer of a cavalry regiment was so much incensed by these outrageous acts of vandalism that he compelled the miscreants to suspend their villanous (sic) work at the point of the pistol.
This (Thirty-seventh) Regiment will need some active discipline to make it any credit to the service. On yesterday Lieut. Col.
Burke found it necessary to shoot private William Moran through the head for insubordination. The men of the regiment were murmuring their discontent at this prompt punishment, into the ear of every visitor, and were not at all loth to use such phrases as that poor Moran was murdered for doing nothing at all.
Later in the day I saw an officer (a captain) of this regiment endeavor to raise a squad, first by entreaty, next by imperative orders. to go with him to put a stop to the depredations of their comrades.
Three or four of them finally obeyed with a very bad grace, and the inquiry, having previously passed among them, "Shall we go?" The "fort" on Munson's Hill I find to be perhaps 300 yards long in the circuit of its parapet, the whole being nothing more than infantry breast-works. having however a rather formidable "Quaker Gun," in the shape of an ash log with a dab of black paint at the butt to represent the muzzle. Such other and more valuable guns as they mav have had here had been carefully removed by the Confeds ; when they withdrew their pickets previously. At the earth-work to the rear of Munson's Hill the retreating Confederates had left six sections of stove-pipe mounted in the six embrasures, and some rather formidable looking (at a distance) earthworks upon Mason's Hill proved, on the occupation of that point by our troops, to be just about of the same bogus nature.
The stars and stripes which have displaced the "stars and bars" here, now float from a small pine tree nearly upon the apex of the hill. There is a quantity of straw on the westerly slope of the hill, but nothing to indicate that the enemy has ever been here in any force.
The bivouac fires of our troops can now be seen two or three miles in advance of this point towards the enemy's House. The Garibaldi Regiment is bivouacked at Bailey's Cross Roads, and the New York 8th (German Regiment) by the Arlington Mills.

SCOUTING PARTY NEAR FALLS CHURCH
These evervday incidents in war are generally so similar in detail as to be monotonous in the description. although in reality few things send the blood with a livelier gallop through the heart then to accompany one of them, either as artist or Special Correspondent The value of life is never so palpable as when the next step may bring us upon the muzzle of a rifle. or a hand to hand encounter with a desperate son of the south. The annexed sketch represents a small party of cavalry scouting in the vicinity of Falls Church. the scene of the late unhappy skirmish, where nearly 30 of our gallant men were either captured or slain. We are glad to learn That General McClellan contemplates issuing an order forbidding these private ventures into the Fox's den. If a correct list were drawn up of all who have been murdered in these imbecile rushes into danger. the community would be horrified at the extent of
the losses.
Of the many tales which have been handed down to this day, the most interesting is that of a humorous capture in an old chestnut tree, first told the author by the late Willis L. Gordon. Mr. Gordon said that the story was told him by Frank Williams, one of Mosby's men. He stated that the old tree was located on the road to Falls Church near the old Merry home just beyond the Dunn Loring Road, near the present day Providence Baptist Church.
The author did not think he would find documentation for this story, but Leslies gave the following account in their issue of October 26. 1861 at page 353. under a drawing by the artist in the field in the paragraph:
A REBEL TREED
Capture of Lieutenant H.J. Segal of the Insurgent army near Falls Church. by Lieutenant-Colonel Winslow and Captain Shat-tuck, of the New York 37th from a sketch by our artist attached to General M'Clellan's command
The following appears separately:
TREEING A REBEL NEAR FAIRFAX
Our artist has sent us so amusing an account of the capture of Lieutenant H.J. Segal of the Confederate army, that we regret we can only epitomise the particulars. On Friday the 4th of OC tober, a scouting party of 18 men under Lieutenant Colonel B.
Winslow and Captain L.B. Shattuck, of the 37th Regiment N.Y. V. were out in the vicinity of the enemy's lines about five miles
Falls Church, in the direction of Fairfax. As they were proceeding in silence and caution through a dense wood, they heard the tramp of horses and the jingle of sabre scabbards. The Lieutenant Colonel and the Captain ordering their men to halt went to re-connoitre. In a short time one of them came upon an open space where they saw four rebels seated under a large chestnut tree. by the side of the road, and engaged in eating chestnuts. The Confederates saw him and sprang upon their horses. The officer crying in a loud voice "Charge!" by the time the scouting party had got up the four "Gallant" horsemen were beyond pursuit The men were about gathering up the spoils of the Victory, which consisted of four sabres, two revolvers, four coats and blankets. when they saw a horse tied to a tree by the roadside. A further search revealed its master perched upon the lower limb of a large chestnut--whither he had climbed with his sabre to lop off the fruit. A dozen rifles pointed at his breast soon brought him to reason, and he surrendered himself a prisoner. When he got down and felt safe, he began to 'blow with true Southern chivalry; and, when brought before General McDowell, cooly boasted that at the battle of Bull Run he had aimed repeatedly at the General. but had always missed. General McDowell smiled, and said that he would send him somewhere where he would not have another
chance for some time.
Mr. Gordon said that in the early part of this present century he and his wife were riding in their carriage up the pike during a hard storm which had come up after they had left their home. They passed the Dunn Loring Road, and decided to pause under the tree until the worst seemed over.
The great branches of the old tree crossed the road, and offered ample pro-tection. As they pulled away, (having gone about fifty feet), a bolt of lightning split the ancient landmark into pieces
The following article concerning Munson's Hill is taken from page 292
of Leslie's for September 21, 1861
MUNSON'S HILL, NEAR WASHINGTON
During the last few weeks, Munson's Hill, a prominence about five miles from Chain Bridge. has become a spot to which all eyes have been directed. It is on the northern side of the Lees-burg turnpike, about one mile from Bailey's Cross-roads, where our pickets are stationed, and about three miles this side of Falls Church. which is in full possession of the enemy. It commands no road excepting the Leesburg turnpike, the Columbia turnpike being sheltered by thick woods up to the crossing. Its defenses are unimportant, being simple breastworks of considerable extent, but not ditched, and not embrasured for artillery. Those who saw the deserted works at Fairfax Court House and Centerville will understand just how little these are worth, for they are of exactly the same order. The elevation of the hill is not great, and its summit can be approached to within a few hundred yards from the

From the four mile Run the rebel outposts cross directly to Munson's Hill, on the slope of which they descend to within a half mile of Bailey's Roads. From this point down to Benton's Tavern they hold the Columbia turnpike, and thence stretch across in almost a straight line to near the mouth of Occotink Run, the last place at which our pickets meet them.
The following is a copy of the report of Colonel J.E.B. Stuart to Genera Longstreet:
Headquarters, Munson's Hill, August 28, 1861.
General:
I inclose a list of killed and wounded (1 killed and 6 wounded).
I have no time for a detailed report on the affair of yesterday. but I acquainted Rev. D. Ball, chaplain of my regiment, as well as Major Skinner, with all the particulars, and requested them to inform you last night, which I hope will answer for present. As soon as it was fair light this morning I had a piece of rifled cannon.
Washington Battery (Artillery), brought clandestinely in position to bear on Bailey's Cross-Roads and fired four shots. distance being by the shots 1,350 yards. The shots took effect admirably, dispersing the entire force at that point, and developed what it was my object to ascertain- that they had no artillery there. Mun-son's Fill is a fine place for a battery, and is more capable of defense than Mason's Hill. The fire of artillery dispersed also a long line of skirmishers, who ran precipitately without being in the slightest danger from its shots. The 1st Regiment is at Falls Church. and I have directed its commander to hold himself in readiness to move up to my support, or act to the left as circumstances indicate. Two companies of that regiment are ordered to occupy the ridge along Upton's. I sent back Beckman's section of artil-lery, as the men were pretty well used up from fatigue and hunger. and I am now going to send back to Mason's Hill Major Johnson's command, and relieve those companies of your command here. who have been out so long, and send them back to Falls Church.
I believe this a fine line teetense: mean the line passing through is and Mason's Hill. Every inch of the road is visible from here tIBailey's Cross Roads. The force now here and at Falls Church consider sufficient for the present. and the best school of prac-lice possible for our troops. I consider the enemy's design not I meet us outside their trenches in force pretty well developed.
Please send this to General Johnston for me.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant.
J.E.B. Stuart, Colonel, Commanding.
J. Longstreet. Brigadier-General.
ps. The scattered fragments of the force at Bailey's Cross-roads reassembled, and I have the place in position to stir them up again whenever the group is in sufficient force to warrant the expenditure of our ammunition.
J.E. B.S.
In the September 28. 1861 issue of Leslie's at page 310, is an item concerning the defenses at Bailey's Crossroads and at Munson's Hill. The picture. at page 311. is entitled: "Bailey's Cross Roads. Virginia- the advanced posts of the Federal Pickets, Munson's Hill one mile in the distance_-from a sketch by our special artist with General McClellan's command." The article follows:
BAILEY'S CROSS ROADS AND MUNSON'S HILL
Court House and the Leesburg turnpike, about five miles to the South-West of Long Bridge. It is evidently regarded by General McClellan as important strategically, and has been held by him with great tenacity. Never of high architectual pretensions, the few buildings that remain show the dilapidation and ruin incident of war, and make the place less attractive than before. It is but about a mile from the rebel position on Munson's Hill, which is in full view
During the summer of 1862, incidental to the recapture of Munson's Fill, there was an engagement and bombardment. The affair began at the Union position at Fort Head (Tyson's Cross Roads). The residents of Falls Church were forced to flee for safety. As Wadsworth's shells fell around the old colonial church, the citizens. in carts and on foot, fled to the Dulany farm, later the home of Silas Tripp, now Greenway Downs. Here they were forced to remain several weeks. Troops in the abandoned Village turned pigs out, forced their way into dwellings, and ruined gardens. Several citizens took their cows with them to Dulany's, and the milk spoiled because of the lack of means to keep it cool. They cooked on an old cookstove with the help of an ancient colored servant of Mr. Dulany. The men put the stove out in the pasture, and it was in use all day.

GRAND REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL ARMY AT WASH.
INGTON. SEVENTY THOUSAND MEN ON THE FIELD.
The review held by General McClellan on Wednesday, the 20th of November, presented a spectacle never witnessed on this side of the Atlantic, for on that day nearly 70,00 patriot soldiers stood in arms ready to meet the enemies of their country, who combine the two-fold characters of rebels and brothers.
The spot chosen for the review was the open plain adjoining
Bailey's Cross Roads, and the adjacent hills, Mason's and Munson' We have described and illustrated these localities so often that we shall content ourselves by adding that Bailey's Cross Roads are situated eight miles from '
Washington, in the direction of Fair-
fax Court House, at the junction of the Columbia turnpike and the Alexandria and Leesburg turnpike. Between the Cross Roads and Munson's Hill, a mile and a half distant towards Falls Church, is a plain two miles in length, which was prepared by clearing off the fences, filling up the ditches, etc., for this grand display.
At half-past nine o'clock the General commanding, attended by all his staff officers, left his headquarters, escorted by a column of 18.000 regular cavalry. The array was most imposing as this splendid cortege moved through the streets, the cavalry marching by platoons until it reached the bridge, where it was compelled to march by columns of four, and afterwards defiled along the road leading by Arlington Heights to the review ground.
McClellan was plainly attired. As he rode in advance of his numerous retinue he was loudly cheered.
In the upper and lower divisions, Gen. McCall's and Gen Heintzelman's from which a march ofsome eightor ten miles had to be made, the troops were astir at from two to three o'clock in the morning, and were on the march long before daylight. All of the seven divisions on the Virginia side of the Potomac were represented in the review, but enough were left in each to supply double the usual picket force to guard the camps, and a reserve in addition strong enough to repel any attack in force the enemy could make.
As early as nine o'clock the head of the column of Gen. Blenker's
division the headquarters of which are nearest to Bailey's began to arrive at the grounds from the Washington road. Soon after den. McDowell's advance guard appeared on a road entering the grounds from the same direction, but farther to the west. Next time the head of Gen. Franklin's column, approaching from the Alexandria road; and soon after the division o
Gen. Smith began
to enter the grounds from the direction of Falls Church. Gen.
Fitz John Porter was next on the ground, bringing his forces by still another road. The troops now poured in from all directions. those under Gen. Heintzelman following Gen. Franklin's division, and the column of Gen. McCall succeeding that of Gen. Smith, and continued without cessation until half-past eleven o'clock.
The scene now was most exhilarating more than 20 Generals, with their staffs, numbering above 150 horsemen, were dashing hither and thither arranging their divisions which presented a total of above 70,000 men, including seven regiments of cavalry. numbering nearly 8,000 men.
At a quarter past 11 o'clock the President of the United States entered the grounds in his carriage, followed by the Secretary of State, also in his carriage, and by the Secretary of War and Post-Master General, accompanied by Mrs. General McDowell and by two daughters of General Taylor on Horseback. The party were escorted to a slight elevation near the centre of the area, marked by a white flag, where they were soon joined by General McClellan and his staff. The cavalry escort was formed in line on the left. The seven regiments of volunteer cavalry, and the entire artillery present, were placed on the outer margin of the grounds. The infantry were formed into columns by divisions in
ignated for that purpose.
In the meantime the President and Secretary of State, Secretary of War and Assistant Secretary of War, alighted from their carriages, mounted horses and prepared to accompany General McClellan in his review of the lines. This occupied about an hour and a half. Then commenced the march of the troops past in review. The honor of leading the column was assigned the First Rifle Regiment of Pennsylvania Reserve, or the Bucktails, which was with General McClellan in Western Virginia. The divisions then passed in the following order:
First-General McCall's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Mead, Reynolds. and Ord Second--General Heintzelman's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Sedgwick, Jamison and Richardson.
Third--General Smith's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Hancock, Brooks, and Benham.
Water was scarce during 1898 because of the large numbers of troops stationed here. The Army hauled water from Washington in large white. painted barrels and one of them was placed in front of Mankin's Notions & Dry Goods Store.
Soldiers stood guard around the clock to prevent anyone from poisoning the water. Many wells were sunk at Dunn Loring, where the troops came by train, if they did not get off at East Falls Church. They also had a post at Dunn Loring.
The little red brick Post Office building (now a cleaning establishment) was built several years prior to the war by Mr. Charles E. Mankin. During the war it was found necessary to enlarge the building because of the volume of mail coming to Camp Alger, and the back wing was added.
When the troops were recalled at the close of the war, Falls Church quieted down to a more normal pace, but was for the first time what one writer called
"cosmopolitan Falls Church." Many local girls married soldiers, and ties were made with other states. The village of Falls Church lingers today in the memories of former Camp Alger soldiers. Typical of these is Congressman Barrett O'Hara (R) of Illinois, who called on this author for information concerning the location of the camp, as it was the first time he had made a trip here in many years.
At Camp Alger was the home of a fine Negro, fondly called "Ike." Isaac Norment was a graduate of Oberlin College, as was his wife. During the war they opened their home to General Butler, and it served as his headquarters.
The Village of Falls Church in 1892
The following account of Falls Church as it appeared in 1892 is taken from the unpublished autobiography of the late Charles A. Stewart.)
...My wife and I first went to Falls Church in Sept. 1892 and lived there about a year, making some very pleasant acquaintances and a few friends that ever after remained faithful. It was in the summer of 1894 that I built a six-room cottage at East End, as it was then called, and became from the fall of that year a permanent resident of the town. The town of Falls Church at that time had about 1,100 inhabitants and the only means of transportation to Washington except by horse back or horse drawn vehicle, was by the steam cars on a branch of the Southern Railway extending from the junction with the main of the R.F. & P.R.R. near Alexandria to Round Hill at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Upon the outbreak of World War Two, the communitv responded once more with the same vigor and patriotism. Among the men who lost their lives were Corbin Braxton Bryan III, Daniel C. Budd, William Ulysses Chinn, Thomas J. Cunningham, William S. Fought, Rov L. Gilbert. Warren
L. Hawley, John M. Koutsos, Norman E. Leppert, Lindon R. Marshall, Paul F. Martin, Raymond Jacques Martin, Reuben C. Moffat, Joseph W.
Patterson, Jr.. Philip E. Pergande, William P. Sheers, Ralph E. Smith, Linwood F. Spencer, Benjamin S. Stalcup, Victor T. Turrou, Edwin M. Ward, Ir, and James V. Whitmer. Of the 98 reported dead from Fairfax County, 22 were from Falls Church.
During the early part of the war Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed at the home of his brother Milton Eisenhower (the old Rice house "Tali Wood." at 708
East Broad Street). In his book, Crusade in Europe, on page 24, President Eisenhower mentions the house as the house he had not seen in the dav-light. Ann C. Whitman, Personal Secretary to the President on April 4, 1955, stated in a letter to the author
The President spent some time in Dr. Milton Eisenhower's home in Falls Church during 1941. It was a particularly hectic period in the President's life, and he does not recall many of the details of his existence, outside of the strenuous and long working hours.
After 1917 Falls Church lost most of its small town character and reached City status at the close of World War Two. It is difficult to give an adequate description of Falls Church prior to 1917, and after 1898. Here is an account written in 1907:
Falls Church, one of the most beautiful suburban communities in Virginia, is situated on the boundary line between Alexandria

Envelopes came into general use in 1840, and prior to that time letter were folded and sealed with wax.
The earliest known stopping place on the mail route in Falls Church was
Mt. Hope the old Coe-Duncan house on Oak Street near West Broad sweet. Af this same time the Big Chimneys Tavern was a stopping pace for mail riders. The Post Office at Falls Church after 1850 was in the see Tavern. The first Post Master at Falls Church, Charles Upton, of "Upas Hill," was appointed by the President on June 11, 1849.
Charles Horace Upton was a native of Salem, Mass., and a graduate o Bowdoin College. He came to Falls Church in 1837 and engaged in" cultural and literary pursuits." He was Post Master for eleven days! The second Post Master, Dr. Simon J. Groot, was an early physician in Fals Church. Upton continued to live near Falls Church, and in 1861 was electer as the first Republican representative to Congress from Virginia. He later was Consul General to Switzerland, and died in 1877.
The Falls Church Post Office served about one hundred twentv-five families in its infancy. This service was later expanded to meet the need of a growing community. At about the same time as the Johnstown Flood the Potomac River rose, and mail delivery was interrupted. A group of Falls Church men, in cluding M.E. Church, J.W. Brown, Eli Northrup and Post Master, Chats
E. Mankin, took turns in rowing the flooded Potomac for the mail bag.
The Post Office was moved during the 1880's from the Star Tavern 10

There was a special place at the fireside for Mammy. She was an insin tion: life did not function without her. In the corner by the fire. in the bs spot, was Mammy's chair. Here in slave times she nursed her "white ai dren," gave them a growing philosophy of life, and prepared them for the place in society a place she usually determined.
The Negro Mammy of yesterday was a basic influence on the everyda life of Falls Church, She held a respected place in the family, and her word was law. Usually a woman of superior intelligence and character, Mamm was chief among the servants (they were called slaves in legal documents!
When "Big Chimneys" was dismantled during the early 1900's. the bids from the huge end chimneys were purchased by the Tinners and used in new Negro homes. These new chimneys were smaller, but the bricks were

Many intelligent Negroes. former slaves. aided in the despon-Silustment following the War Between the States. They were always part af the community. even in slave times, and continued to build in the new society. One reason for the outstanding contribution of our Negro citizens was the close relationship between them and their white families. This is indicated in a deposition made by John R. Minor, of Minor's Hill, age 80
years, on January 5, 1895:1
Up until the late war, when the Negroes were freed, white women and children especially used to often stay at the house of Negroes over night, and sometimes for several days and nights. The Ne groes were generally their old servants, or well known to the fam-ilv. The children were often left with them for several days and nights at a time, especially with their old mammys, and some. times when children would get out with their parents they would

I remember old Frederick Foote was thought a great deal of by the white people and so was his wife, and children used to very frequently go to their house and stay all night. When he belonged to my uncle, Major Phil Minor, he had the entire charge of my uncle's place for months at a time. My uncle had a very fine place in the country (at Falls Church) but spent most of his time in the City of Washington, and as Fred was a very trusty and reliable servant, he left him in charge of everything. A great many white people used to go there when Fred and his family were there by them-selves. The custom prevailed up until the late war.
This old-time Falls Church resident introduces us to some of the best known early citizens of the Negro community. Frederick Forrest Foote, Jr. as a member of the Town Council from his appointment, August 1, 1881, until his death in 1889!

Following the Emancipation Proclamation, Frederick Foote joined the Union Army, and later received a pension. By action of the 48th Congress (Bill S.1494) relief in the amount of $1095.00 was granted Mr. Foote for supplies taken from his farm for use by the Union Army. This bill was introduced February 11, 1884. He worked for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the night-shift to earn money to purchase his farm. In 1864 he purchased 33.5 acres of land at what is now 7 Corners Shopping Center for 500.00.
He enlarged this to forty acres, selling some late in life. By his Will, Mr.
Foote directed that the land never be sold, but must remain in the Foote family. When taxes got out of proportion, his children, Margaret Jackson.
Virginia Jackson, and Frank Foote, during the 1950's, obtained release from the Will by a law suit. They sold the land for $750,000, and the 7 Corners Shopping Center was erected on it.
Frederick Forrest Foote. (called Senior), was a son of the older Frederick Foote mentioned in the depositions. When he died in 1889, the Town Coun all passed a resolution of honor, had it engrossed for the family, and members of the Council served as pall-bearers. Mr. Foote was not only community-minded, but owned a large grocery and provisions store on the corner of Broad and South Washington Streets (later site of Kents Cleaners). Mr.
Foote was also a long-time shoemaker in Falls Church.
Mr. Foote's wife, Mary F. Foote, died in 1928. Their two children, Fred,

Mr. Foote was never affiliated with any church, and it was well known in the community that he would not lie, and kept his word. He did not smoke. drink or gamble. In later years he was a strong supporter of civil rights causes and was for many years a member of the NAACP.
Another well-known Negro family were the Coates. Old John Minor re called Charles Coates, ancestor of all by that name in Falls Church:

Aunt Fanny Robinson was a practical nurse and midwife who delivered several generations of local children. She lived with her husband, Mitchel Robinson (who, for some reason, was never called uncle), at Merrifield.
Mr. Robinson farmed for Judge Riley. Mrs. Charles E. Gage recalls that Aunt Fanny was tall and thin, with gray hair, parted in the middle. She had a sweet and gentle voice, and was greatly loved. Her husband was good and honest.! The last baby delivered by Aunt Fanny was the late Brooks Oden.
Aunt Caroline Kerfert |Kerfoot| was another trusted and beloved citizen.
A former slave, Aunt Caroline worked for most of the better known citizens of Falls Church. She was a good worker and particular about the families who hired her. She was an employee of Mrs. William H.G. Lynch for many years. Aunt Caroline never married, and it is thought she had no relatives in this country. As one old resident put it, her many friends made up for the lack of them. It is difficult to piece together the story of her long life. She was said to be the daughter of an African Chief, and brought to this country before the War Between the States. During her life-time, Aunt Caroline practiced her "religion," that of voodoo, spirit worship and animism. She arose with the sun, to worship, and also had a ritual for the sunset and full moon. If a rainbow or full moon appeared. Aunt Caroline put on a fresh white apron, and would go into the middle of Broad Street for her "spirit-uals." Swinging a small silver pail over her head, she would sing and chant womething that sounded like: "Hello Mr. Dave. hello Mr. Will.* Her spirit worship did not prevent her regular attendance at the Methodist Church.

During the war and just before, the slaves were allowed to attend services in the rear of the old Episcopal Church at Falls Church and we occasionally heard preaching by some Negro who had been permitted to preach. Before the war there was quite a belief in the power of magic and hoodooism or voo-dooism. I have been taken by my mother to visit the practitioners of this art to find out things my mother wanted to know. Even today there are some people about here who believe in the power of magic. One of the Negro preachers who traveled in my day before the war was a man named Hawley.
Shortly after the war began, a man named Reed, who lived on the present site of the Virginia Home for feeble minded persons. taught school for the benefit of many of the Negroes who would come to his home. He also taught Bible lessons at a Sunday School. He was Captain of the Home Guards. One night Mosby's men came into town and because of Reed's relations to Negroes. took him out into the pines about the house and shot him and two other men who lived with him.
In 1865 Thomas Green and "Bill' Stuart came into the town after service in the Army and began to hold prayer meetings along with George Rumbles, and Nathan Rumbles. The first two men were Baptist, and the others Methodist.

## Historical Context
This work contributes to our understanding of Falls Church not just as a geographical or political entity, but as a living community composed of families and individuals. The "fence and fireside" approach captures both the public interactions between neighbors (the fence) and the private family life (the fireside) that together create the fabric of a community. This social history perspective complements the more formal political and infrastructure-focused histories of the city.

The Story of Falls Church
The community located just 10 miles from the nation’s capital and today known as Falls Church
boasts a history rich in culture and diversity.

The People to 1700
Native Peoples and Their Land

of Virginia

For thousands of years, native peoples lived in the Falls Church vicinity including a tribe called the
Dogue near the Potomac River. They were aligned with the Powhatan Confederacy, led by Chief
Powhatan (Wahunsenacawh), father of Pocahontas (Matoaka). The people in this area grew corn,
beans, squash and tobacco, collected wild plants, and fished for sturgeon and other migratory
species. They hunted deer, bison, bears, wild turkey, small game and birds. They traded with other
tribes and later, settlers, traveling via waterways and connecting trails, which were the earliest
routes and became integral to the region’s history.
European Colonists
By the late 1600s, increasing hostility and conflict
caused by European settlement drove the native
peoples from their traditional lifestyle and lands. Some
assimilated into the community. Many moved and
settled in other locations. The Europeans used the
same water routes and the extensive trail system
established by the natives as their basic means of
travel, commerce and settlement. The newcomers first
settled near the larger rivers and creeks. A log cabin
with two large brick chimneys was likely built in Falls
Church in 1699 by an independent farmer. Known as
“Big Chimneys,” the house was the first known
European structure in the area. It stood until the early
20th century near today’s Big Chimneys Park, located at
Annandale Road and Maple Avenue.

Africans In Virginia
In August of 1619, a British ship sailing under a Dutch
flag brought the first Africans to North America.
Originally captured by Portuguese traders and held in
Angola, roughly twenty Africans, from west-central
Africa, were forcibly abducted and transported to what
is now Hampton, Virginia. The tragedy of the
transatlantic slave trade continued for centuries. Early
records of Falls Church and nearby areas document
that both free men and women of color and enslaved
people of African descent were part of the Village of
Falls Church as early as the mid-1700s. These early
African Americans were skilled in farming, weaving,
metalwork and other crafts, making them valuable
contributors to the local economy.

Tobacco and the Early Economy

Native people introduced tobacco to the Europeans soon
after their 1607 settlement in Jamestown, Virginia. As the
English tried various means to sustain their new colony,
the plant became a popular cash crop. Tobacco was used
as currency to pay taxes collected by local churches.
Cutting, curing and transporting tobacco for shipment was
labor intensive, fueling the transport and sale of enslaved
African people as field workers. Away from the rivers,
“rolling roads” of wood slabs allowed large barrels or
casks called hogsheads to be pulled by oxen to the
warehouses, inspectors and ports. Enslaved Africans and
indentured Europeans often built the ox roads that were
used throughout the area. A historic sign on Annandale
Road marks the remains of one such road.

The Falls Church and Community
The Falls Church Episcopal. MRSPL

Plaque installed at The Falls Church, 2017

Most Virginia colonists were members of the Church of England, also known as the Anglican or
Episcopal Church. In 1724, the first church in the area was established near the Potomac River at
Pohick, followed in 1734 by a second church near the Potomac River Falls, soon known as “The
Falls Church.” In 1748, the influential George Mason was named a vestryman, and in 1762, 30year-old George Washington was also named to the vestry. Washington and his neighbor George
William Fairfax led efforts to replace the wood structure. The current church, built between 17671769, was designed by James Wren. Both churches were likely built with enslaved labor. The
church that gave the City of Falls Church its name was the center of local life and served as a
Revolutionary War recruiting station. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read from its
steps.
Near the Nation’s Capital
The history of Falls Church has close ties to the nation’s capital. After the American Revolution, a
capital city was planned along the Potomac River, near the home of George Washington. Major
Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, a free African American mathematician and astronomer,
surveyed the boundary in 1791, placing the west corner stone for the District of Columbia on
Meridian Street. A second stone stands on what is now Van Buren Street. During the War of 1812
with the British, American gunpowder and arms were moved from Washington to the Dulany family
farm in Falls Church for safe keeping. President James Madison and his wife traveled separately on
congested local roads to escape the burning of Washington by British troops. Dolly Madison’s
carriages held the White House silver and George Washington’s portrait, saved with help from Paul
Jennings, an enslaved servant. President Madison stayed at Wren’s Tavern in Falls Church.

Virginia Village 1815-1861
Turnpikes and Tolls
Falls Church’s location was not only close to the
nation’s capital, it was also an important stop along
the route from Alexandria’s port on the Potomac
River to Leesburg and the western mountains. The
Leesburg Turnpike Company was established by
the Virginia General Assembly in 1809 to construct
a road from Leesburg to “a point on the Little River
Turnpike” to improve travel and commerce. In 1818,
merchants in Washington City won the right to
connect a second pike to Georgetown via the
present-day Chain Bridge. The Leesburg Turnpike –
now State Route 7 – was later paved through Falls
Church, and finally opened in 1838. One of its six
toll gates was built in Falls Church near Wren’s
Tavern.

The Village Grows
By the 1830s, Falls Church was a growing,
prosperous village, a marketplace and a service
stop for travelers. Blacksmiths and wheelwrights
were numerous, and by 1828, Falls Church was
home to five inns and ordinaries, including Wren’s
Tavern, dating to circa 1785. Providing food, drink
and lodging, the inns and taverns were centers of
political discussions and social gatherings. The
village became a hub for commerce, with farms and
orchards providing produce for the local market,

Alexandria and Washington City. Northerners
attracted by the cheap farmland and warmer climate moved to the area. Cherry Hill Farmhouse
(1845), the Lawton House (1854), the Birch House (1840s), and several other homes built along the
turnpike still stand today. Better roads also improved regional communication, earning Falls Church
a post office, located in the Star Tavern.
Church and Community
From its earliest days, Falls Church has been a welcoming place for people of many beliefs.
In the 1770s, Methodist church members established the Fairfax Chapel (site is in Oakwood
Cemetery). Bishop Francis Asbury, founding father of the American Methodist Church, and Harry
Hoosier, the first African American Methodist minister, visited Falls Church often. By the 1800s,
Methodists replaced the Anglicans as the area’s largest congregation. During these years,
Presbyterians met in private homes. The Civil War brought many changes to the village, including
damages to The Falls Church and the destruction of Fairfax Chapel. Columbia Baptist Church,
established in 1856, allowed people of color to worship in the balcony. Abolitionist leaders
encouraged the establishment of the African American Galloway Methodist Church (1867) and the
Second Baptist Church (1871). The war split the Methodists into separate Southern and Northern
congregations. St. James Catholic Church began in 1874, followed by the Congregational Church in
1885.

National politics influenced Falls Church. In 1858, Harriet Foote Turner, a local free woman of color,
led 12 enslaved people to freedom in Canada by posing as their owner. In the 1860 Presidential
election, some residents voted for Abraham Lincoln, rare in Virginia. During the 1861 referendum to
leave the Union, more than a third of the local citizens voted secession despite intimidation. After
Virginia joined the Confederacy and Union troops “invaded” the commonwealth, friends and
neighbors were forced to choose sides. Black and white Union supporters formed a local Home
Guard. Some African Americans joined the U.S. Colored Troops. In June 1861, Thaddeus Lowe
used a hot air balloon to report Confederate troop movements in Falls Church, the first such U.S.
military use. In November 1861, Julia Ward Howe was inspired by a visit to Union Army camps near
Falls Church to write the words to the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”
Between Two Armies

Falls Church lay just outside a line of forts protecting the Union capital. In July 1861, thousands of
Union soldiers marched through the village to engage Confederate forces who won the first battle at
Manassas along Bull Run. Seeing so many Union soldiers retreating in disarray through the village
unnerved some residents, who quickly fled. Roughly 20,000 Confederate troops occupied Falls
Church for the rest of the summer. In late September, the Confederates pulled out, and Union
troops regained control of the area. After a second battle at Manassas in August 1862 and the
September battle at Antietam, Maryland, hundreds of wounded and sick soldiers were brought to
makeshift hospitals in churches and barns. Tent camps sprouted up and fences became fuel for
campfires. The graveyard at the Falls Church became the final resting place of soldiers from both
sides.
Fear and Resistance
The Union Army occupied Falls Church from fall 1861 to the end of the war, but
residents also feared Confederate partisans. By 1864, Confederate Col. John
Singleton Mosby’s Raiders were actively staging night raids while an interracial
Home Guard of Civilians kept watch over the village. On October 2, 1864, 75
Raiders rode down the turnpike after dark, killing two Home Guard members,
including freedman Frank Brooks, a free African American. They took two
captives, including John Read, an abolitionist Home Guard member who with

Church residents suffered losses of buildings, fences, livestock, crops and other
property. After the war, the Southern Claims Commission processed requests for
payment of damages to Union loyalists including several free African American families.

Coming of the Railroad

West Falls Church Railroad Station. MRSPL

Railroads began to spread across the eastern seaboard in the 1830s, providing fast and reliable
transportation for goods and passengers. The local railroad received its charter in 1847, and by
May of 1860, trains ran between Alexandria and Leesburg, including a station at West Falls Church.
A trip that required a half-day’s journey by horse took only 35 minutes by train and cost 50 cents.
The line closed during the Civil War and later reopened, with a second local station built at East
Falls Church in 1870. The line was renamed the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. The
W&OD ceased operations in 1968 and its right-of-way is now a recreational trail stretching 45 miles
from the Potomac River to Purcellville, Virginia.
Reconstruction and the Town
Following the Civil War, black and white residents rebuilt their lives.
Many who fled during the war returned, and newcomers arrived seeking
cheap land, a better climate and government jobs. African Americans
created a thriving community by purchasing land despite price gouging,
successfully fighting for and gaining municipal services to establish
businesses and churches. Through the leadership of Joseph Riley, the
Town of Falls Church was incorporated in 1875, enabling local control
of taxes, roads and schools. A school for white children was built in
1882, but the Falls Church Colored School was not built until 1888, and
then only after a determined appeal by African American civic leaders.
Frederick Foote Jr., a respected black merchant, was elected to the
town council for four terms (1880-1889). One year later, the town
council voted to eliminate the influence of black voters by giving up onethird of the town to Fairfax County.

The late 1800s was a time of modernization.
The center of town was made up of thriving
businesses owned by black and white residents
and patronized by all. During this period, Village
Improvement Societies (VIS) were formed in
many places, including Falls Church in 1885.
The community celebrated the first Arbor Day in
Virginia in 1892, prompting residents to plant a
canopy of trees along paved roads. The Falls
Church Telephone Company began operations
in 1888, and electric trolley service reached
East Falls Church in 1897. Residential
development increased, with the first
subdivisions constructed in 1891, followed by
electricity in 1898. Educator Mattie Gundry
formed the Virginia Training School in 1899,
where she taught mentally disadvantaged
students skills to enrich their lives. The same
year, the Falls Church Library Association
created the first public library under the
leadership of Mary Riley Styles.

The Spanish American War

Alger, 1898. MRSPL

The sinking of the USS Maine at Havana, Cuba, ignited the
Spanish American War in 1898, dramatically changing life in
Falls Church. Southwest of town, Camp Alger was built to
train 30,000 troops, including African Americans of the 10th
Cavalry Buffalo soldiers. The East Falls Church train station
became a bustling center full of recruits, camp suppliers and
visitors. Crowded army trains, drum noise, wagon and
carriage traffic and carousing soldiers disrupted local life.
Among the visitors was President William McKinley, who
arrived with an entourage of cabinet officers and foreign
dignitaries to review 15,000 troops. They rode 200 horses
into town, creating a cloud of dust that rendered visibility
nearly impossible. In July of 1898, an outbreak of typhoid
prompted the closing of Camp Alger by September.

Civil Rights and Segregation
By 1900, Falls Church was the largest town in Fairfax County. A
1904 map of the town shows 125 homes, 55 stores and offices,
seven churches and 38 properties that could support farms and
orchards. In many ways, Falls Church was progressive. But in
1912, Virginia passed legislation allowing communities to impose
segregation. In 1915, the town council proposed an ordinance
mandating African Americans live in specific confined areas of
town. Local black citizens E.B. Henderson, Joseph Tinner and
seven other men formed the Colored Citizens Protective League
to object. The group ultimately became the first rural branch of the
NAACP in the nation. They strategized and hired legal counsel to
establish the unconstitutionality of the ordinance. Although they
were successful in preventing its implementation, many public
facilities remained segregated.

The Great War and Postwar Progress
When the nation entered World War I, local officials pushed for the reopening of Camp Alger near
Falls Church, but the War Department selected land south of Alexandria that became Fort Belvoir.
Five of the 314 men from Falls Church who were drafted died in military service. The war ended in
November 1918 coinciding with the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, which infected 500 million
worldwide and killed 531 in Fairfax County. With men at war, women in Falls Church took on new
roles, joining the women’s suffrage movement, and eventually earning the right to vote. In 1921,
Falls Church elected two women to town council: Mrs. P.H. Smyth and Mattie Gundry, who served
three terms and was the first woman to serve on the board of directors of the Falls Church Bank.
Mary Ellen Henderson and Viola Hudson were civil rights activists and women’s rights reformers
whose efforts resulted in achieving equal facilities for black students at the Falls Church Colored
School and public services for the black community.

The Emerging City 1920-1950
From Horses to Highway

Plans for Lee Highway, ca. 1922. VDOT
Local roads were winding and narrow, cheap to build and maintain as they followed the contour of
the land for horses and wagons. Automobiles required straighter, paved roads to allow for their
increased speed, safety, visibility and mechanical vulnerability. In 1919, the association for planning
national highways proposed Lee Highway as a coast-to-coast road. The first portion was completed
by 1928 and provided a paved road from southwest Virginia to Washington, D.C. A local
businessman, Merton E. Church, whose company paved the road with concrete from Falls Church
to the Fairfax courthouse, was largely responsible for routing the highway through town. It improved
the regional transportation network and benefitted development, but its construction disrupted
businesses and bisected the property of many residents, including the thriving African American
community.
Growing Pains
Between the two World Wars, and in spite of the Great
Depression, Falls Church prospered. It grew in
population as a suburban community for the nation’s
capital, with many residents working in governmentrelated jobs. In 1924, Virginia established a separate
school district for the town. Two years later, Madison
Elementary School opened, and the Jefferson Institute
became a four-year high school. Both schools were for
white students only. It was not until after World War II
that modern schools were built for black children. In
1930, the town built a municipal water system to serve
the growing community. East Falls Church residents,
dissatisfied with the town’s priorities, and voted to rejoin
Arlington County in 1936. That same year, the airconditioned State Theater opened, making the town a
popular local destination. Increasing car ownership
helped end local trolley service in 1939.

World War II and City Status
During World War II, 25 Falls Church servicemen died or went
missing. In 1945, Virginia abolished the independence of the town’s
schools, placing them under Fairfax County jurisdiction. This decision,
along with concerns about property taxes, municipal water,
transportation and town planning, led to a drive for independent
status. Falls Church became a city in 1948, with the population
topping 5,000 and rising due to the postwar “baby boom.” Civic and
social organizations flourished. In 1949, the City once again operated
its own school district with 927 students. That same year, James Lee
Elementary School for African American students was built in Fairfax
County. Like most of American society, the community and schools
remained largely segregated, excluding blacks from social and cultural
services. African Americans founded their own service groups, such as
the Mother’s Council, Masons and Eastern Star.

1950 And Beyond
A Small Independent City
By the end of the 20th century, the City’s population had tripled. Its housing and neighborhoods
have become a notable mix of preserved pre-1910 houses and newer residential construction with
affordable housing as a continuing challenge. Commercial development and transportation
improvements from the 1950s to the 1980s (Seven Corners, Tyson’s Corner, Capital Beltway,
Metro and Route 66) have emphasized Falls Church’s links to the greater area. These changes
also enhanced the community’s vitality and improved residents’ access to shopping, businesses
and cultural institutions.
Continuing the struggles and successes of the early 20th century, African American residents led
efforts to obtain full civil rights. In 1961 for example, a diverse coalition of City activists successfully
ended segregation in Falls Church schools, becoming only the second Virginia community to do so.
The City’s cultural diversity broadened in the last decades of the 20th century as peoples from Asia,
Central and South America, many seeking refuge from wars and other conflicts, became the latest
neighbors in the area. In 1964, Eden Center, the largest Asian-themed shopping complex on the
East Coast, opened in Falls Church.
The City has been recognized as an All American City by the National Civic League in 1962 and
continues to be named a state leader in Tree City USA recognition annually through the National
Arbor Day Foundation. During unprecedented growth and change, the City continues to maintain its
identity and provide high quality schools, environmentally friendly greenspaces, quality housing and
small-town character.

# All-American Crossroads

## Source Information
Author: Jeanne Rust

## Description
This document preserves the content of Jeanne Rust's historical work "All-American Crossroads," which examines Falls Church as a significant junction of transportation routes and explores how its position as a crossroads shaped its development and character through history.

## Content
Falls Church, Virginia, was just a little crossroads, six miles from the future site of the nation's capital, when it began to develop in the first part of the 1700's. Caught up in the web of American history early in life, Falls Church watched soldiers march through its streets to the French and Indian War; it participated in the Revolutionary War, gave refuge to President Madison during the War of 1812, saw action in the Civil War, and was host to troops during the Spanish-American War. During the course of its history, Falls Church has been threatened by war, by lack of water, by gun powder, and by metropolitanitis; but, it has survived, been ahead of its time in many ways, and been judged an "All-American City." Its perseverance and initiative go back to the time when Falls Church came into existence because of a good fishing hole!
One of the finest fishing holes in all Northern Virginia in the olden days was the Little Falls of the Potomac.
Indians from many tribes, wearing bear or buffalo skins on their bodies and turkey or goose feathers in their hair, fished from the rocks or their canoes for the big fat sturgeons that swam up the Potomac and stopped momentarily at the rocks of the falls. Sport and pleasure reigned. The usual catch for an evening was 30 sturgeons!
Whole tribes of Indians lived at the mouth of Pimmit
Run. Indians came from the northern ridge of Maryland, from the inland trails of Virginia, and by canoe up the channels of the Potomac to fish, swap stories, and trade.
Others found that the breadth of the Potomac at this point (only 72 feet wide) made crossing over from one
side thick to learn the indianen the white man care, he was quick to learn the Indian's way of getting around Crossing over from Maryland into Virginia, the Indian, and later the white man, found that he had two or three trails leading inland from the falls. One of these was Little Falls Road. About five miles inland, Little Falls Road joined another trail, which followed along a natural ridge from Belhaven (Alexandria) to Leesburg. These two trails became rolling roads for tobacco and the Ridge Road (Route7) became so important that many other roads led to it. Among these were Wilson Boulevard, the Fairfax Courthouse Road, the Sugarlands Rolling Road, and the Falls Rolling Road. At Belhaven, the Ridge Road joined the Potomac Path which led even farther south to the Rappa-hannock. The Potomac Path, the Ridge Road, and the Little Falls Road are considered some of the oldest white man's roads in America.
The intersection of the Little Falls Road and the Ridge Road became an early crossroads of frontier life. A store and a tavern soon sprang up to take care of the traveling hunters, traders, drovers, surveyors, and land speculators.
Colonists hurried to take out patents to use the land for future development.
Among these was Thomas Pearson who patented 660 acres on the south side of Four Mile Run, which included Munson Hill. His son, Captain Simon Pearson, took out seven patents in the Falls Church area during the years
1724-1731. One of these patents included the western half of the City of Falls Church and two miles westward where he established his manor house. This house was a large dormered building with a sweeping roof. Situated on a hill against a background of large English boxwood, it could be seen from Route 7 (see cover).
In 1729 William Gunnell received a patent for 400 acres north of Falls Church and 250 acres on the south side of Four Mile Run.
Michael Regan who had a patent for 179 acres later sold his land to John Trammell and little can be found in the records about Michael Regan. John Trammell took out a patent for 248 acres, which included his home site, now known as "Cherry Hill," and later bought Regan's land.
Thomas Harrison received a patent for 271 acres. He was the son of Burr Thomas Harrison, a scout of one sort or another, who fished on the lower Potomac in the early days of Indian hostility and brought back the message (from a Maryland Indian) that the Senecas had been hired to kill the Virginia colonists. The people fled from their plantations in alarm. Harrison's report turned out to be false but the scare slowed down the development of the Hunting Creek area for years. Thomas Harrison was following in his father's footsteps as a scout, when he heard about the good fishing at the falls and decided he wanted a place there. He got his 271 acres and passed the word along to George Harrison who patented 208 acres.
The Harrison patents adjoined each other and were eventually bought out by Colonel James Wren, who established a large plantation and mansion house known as
"Winter Hill." He also was owner of an ordinary which proved to be a very popular stopping place and center of colonial activity.
Synonymous with the names of Burr Harrison and Simon Pearson was that of Captain Charles Broadwater.
He was a merchant mariner who made trips back and forth from England to Virginia. He soon settled down in Virginia, however, after he wooed and won the rich widow West in a fast-orbiting courtship. He patented 430 acres at

and urine, which were ingredients used for dyeing. Children sat on the covered dye pot and adults sat on a settle in front of the fire. Guests ate corn, potatoes, turnips, and pumpkin at the table with the family, sitting on stools or benches. They slept upstairs in the attic on loose floor boards covered with straw, rags, or their own blankets. If the owner was well-to-do, the ordinary had a parlor which doubled as a bedroom and had lean-to's or separate sheds for tanning, drying meat, etc.
"Big Chimneys," which was built in Falls Church in 1699, was one of these. As time passed, its log cabin exterior was painted white and vines and roses climbed up its immense chimneys and over its moss covered roof, giving it the appearance of an English cottage. Boxwood and flowers covered its grounds and a wooden fence kept out roaming cattle. Little bird houses were carved in the front gate posts, which supported wisteria vines. The brasses on the door were kept polished and the handmade glass windows sparkled behind Dutch shutters. The parlor, with its low ceiling, had one wall of scenic wall paper and a black walnut mantel. The entire side wall of the kitchen was a fireplace and Dutch oven. The house was surrounded by dependencies, including a smoke house and wash house.
A date stone in one of the twenty-foot chimneys had the date 1699 carved on it. About that time, the Little Falls Road ran in front of "Big Chimneys," intersected with the original Ridge Road south of the ordinary, and meandered on its way to Ravensworth. Being located within a stone's throw of the intersection of these two main roads, "Big Chimneys" was assured a daily supply of weary travelers.
Another ordinary was located on the west side of Falls Church on the Ridge Road near Pearson's house. It was also a story and a half log building, similar in appearance to "Big Chimneys." It had a robust and lively clientele.
At the same time Simon Pearson was having his trou-bles, the big tracts were beginning to break up and small farms were being occupied by indentures, who in turn were hiring convicts to work for them. As these questionable characters came into the upper regions of the colony, the Assembly temporarily stopped creating counties. and instead started creating parishes, which divided the land but did not give voting rights to the holders. The vestrymen of the parish had to act as county court judges. They had to take care of moral misdemeanors, administer to the poor, discipline vagrants, and procession land (decide boundaries for tithing). If they did not fulfill these duties, they were dismissed,
The parishes tried to set up meeting places wherever the people showed their desire to worship. William Gun-nell, who had moved inland from Alexandria, persuaded the Assembly that a group of people who had been worshiping in his home needed a meeting place. Michael Regan, who was in the group, offered to give two acres of land.
The Assembly looked the area over, decided that the church should not be far from Alexandria but should be fairly near the falls. The intersection of the Little Falls Road and the Alexandria Ridge Road (Route 7) seemed to be the ideal place from the standpoint of accessibility, future growth, and need. A wooden church was built near the intersection on two acres of Michael Regan's land and the Assembly thought of it as the new church or upper church. The people, however, thought of it as the church near their beloved falls and it was inevitable that the new church should eventually be known as the Falls Church and that the community which grew up around it would go by the same name. It was in this way that the community of Falls Church came into being (See plat).

Graves behind the tavern and blood stains on its floor told stories of drunken brawls, duels, and murder.
As the wealthy landowners moved up to occupy their plantations, which had been run by indentures, a society of gentlemen evolved within the Falls Church area. The gentry included the Pearsons, Regans, Gunnells, Tram-mells, Wrens, Harrisons, Broadwaters, Minors, Robertsons, and Adamses. Their mansion houses and plantations were in and near the Falls Church area. They owned or rented slaves, rode in fine carriages, and dressed in velvet and satin. Mrs. Broadwater "held court" seated in her chair of state, with a maid on either side waving peacock fans. A royal governor established his royal hunting lodge in Falls Church. The families living there inter-married with each other and with wealthy landowners, like the Brents and Wests, farther south. Land passed from father to son and from one family to another through marriage. The sons continued the traditions their fathers had followed before them and acted as burgesses, vestrymen for the parishes, and patriots. Captain Pearson's son, Simon, was an unfortunate exception.
His future looked great and he was headed for the House of Burgesses when he met and married Milkey Trammell. He found after a few years they couldn't get along but divorce seemed out of the question since it took an Act of the Assembly to get one. So, he and Milkey (Milcah) parted and Simon went his separate way, living with another young lady without benefit of divorce or re-marriage. He left his dwelling to her and their son but his first wife proclaimed her dower interest in the house and land for their son. When George Washington bought some of Pearson's land, the legal tangle of Pearson's relationship with these two women was a stumbling block for many years and his private life became public prop-erty.

The two acres of land which Michael Regan gave for the church were near the ordinary, "Big Chimneys," and near the supplementary warehouse for tobacco that fed into the warehouses at the falls and Alexandria. Plans began to take shape and in the excitement either a deed to the land was forgotten or Regan died (or moved away) and Trammell bought his land. About ten years later when it was discovered that the church had no deed to the land, John Trammell sold the two acres to the Vestry of Truro Parish for fifty shillings sterling, and gave them a deed.
In the meantime (1733) Richard Blackburn, who is commonly thought of as the architect for Mt. Vernon, built a small wooden church, forty feet long and twenty-two feet wide, making the inside as much like Pohick Church as pos-sible. In 1748 George Mason was elected to the vestry and by 1749 the vestrymen decided to have an addition built to the church. Charles Broadwater was hired to build the addition. In 1762 George Washington was appointed to the vestry and soon afterwards the vestry decided to build two new brick churches, 2,400 square feet in size, with high ceilings and galleries. One was to be built in Falls Church to replace the wooden church and the other (Christ Church) was to be built in Alexandria. The plans were drawn and executed under the supervision of James Wren, descendent of the famous English architect. The old wooden church, which was not worth repairing, was sold and moved away.
The new church was constructed with bricks from Wren's kiln and since there is evidence of an old kiln near the church, it is possible he constructed a supplementary kiln near the church to expedite the building of the brick structure. The walls and ceilings of the church had three coats of plaster; the interior of the church had the finest panelling, cornices, and molding available; the altar, pulpit,
9and canopy were enhanced with Ionic columns. Everything was the best man could provide.
When the church was completed the vestry undertook to buy a glebe for its rector. In these days "the glebe" was very important to the minister for he had to help support himself by raising produce on his land. In 1770 the church wardens of the Falls Church and Christ Church bought 516 acres east of the church for their rector and had a "Man-sion House," kitchen, dairy, meat house, barn, toilet, ete., built on it. The house (home of Mrs. Frank Ball in Arling-ton) was hardly finished before many changes came about due to the outcome of the Revolutionary War and among them was Jefferson's effort to separate the church from the state. A law was passed confiscating the glebes for the poor. When the vestry finally cleared their title to the glebe, they sold it and acquired a rectory opposite the
church.
At the time that Washington was attending Falls Church (reportedly, his first), he was also constantly on the road from Alexandria to Leesburg, surveying and attending to public business. General Braddock's men took the Ridge Road to Ft. Dugesne and camped in the Falls Church yard on their way. When the Revolutionary War broke out, the church became a recruitment center under the direction of Charles Broadwater. Later, the Declaration of Independence was read from its steps. When LaFayette visited Falls Church in 1824, he respectfully tipped his hat to the church as he passed. He spent several hours at "Big Chim-neys." The church at this time was almost deserted. Animals and tramps wandered in and out through its open doors and broken windows. The professors and students of the Virginia Theological Seminary became concerned and began to hold services in the church. Soon, enough interest was aroused to repair the church. Captain Henry Fairfax, who was the grandson of a former rector, financed the res-
10
toration of the church and a tablet commemorating his help was placed on the front wall of the church.
It is possible that the influx of people to Falls Church during this period helped revive the church and the area.
When the United States Government was moved from Philadelphia to Washington in 1800, there was a gradual influx of workers to Falls Church. Washington at that time was a swampy and marshy area. Hotels were so scarce Congressmen had to sleep in rooms where four to eight people stayed. Falls Church was only six miles from Washington; the climate was ideal and the land was rich and well drained. Also, at that time, Virginia had ceded a part of her land to be used for the national government and there was a possibility that the government would eventually reach out into the area of East Falls Church. When stone markers were placed at one-mile intervals for the new boundaries, two markers were located in Falls Church. Among the people who came in at this time were the Reeds, Osborns, Munsons, Baileys, Ives, Klocks, McCauleys, Coes, Bartletts, Thornes, and Almond Birches all from the north. Equally important to the revival of the area were the Southerners who moved into Falls Church. They included the Elliotts, Mills, Febreys, Sherwoods, Fishes, Thompsons, Murrays, Paynes, Nelsons, Lynches, Lightfoots, Sewells, Taylors, Scotts, Darnes, Gotts, Donaldsons, Morans, and Dulanys.
There were three churches: Episcopal, Baptist, and Methodist. A new tavern called "Star Tavern" was built.
It had an ingenious green, glass, candle-lit star on top of a pole at its entrance a forerunner of fluorescent-light ad-vertising. Taylor's Tavern was probably built around this time, also. It was constructed near the site of an old Indian trading post at Seven Corners. Both taverns were more livable than the earlier ordinaries and each had a front porch on which were posted all the latest news, prices, wanted lists, etc.

asked him if there was anything the writer wanted him to tell his friends. Poe's eyes rolled back in his head and his chest heaved, as he took a deep breath and gasped, "Never-more."
When the Civil War came, Falls Church's young men joined both sides. In one family two brothers served for the South and two brothers served for the North. People in the town were involuntary hosts to both sides. Yankee troops riding through the town would draw up to a house, stop to rest and feed their horses, then raid the vegetable garden, orchard, and pantry. They might be just gone when a Confederate group, looking for Yanks, would stop to eat and to rest and feed their horses.
At the beginning of the war, after the First Battle of Manassas, Rebels were all over the area (see picture) and particularly on Munson Hill. General Longstreet was headquartered at the Lawton House in Falls Church and J. E. B.
Stuart could look down from his strategic outpost at Munson Hill and count the tents of Yankee troops spread over the Potomac Valley and around northeast Falls Church.
People in Washington could see the Confederate flag flying from the top of Munson Hill. The Northerners sent up the balloon, "Union," to appraise the situation. The Rebels fired at the Balloon and it soon disappeared, but not before telegraphing back that "Falls Church and its girdle of encampments was a superb scene." Stuart played up the deception of his strength by building bonfires at night and having his soldiers parade in front of them. He and his men built fake breastworks on Munson Hill, painted big logs black at one end and placed them in such a position that, to the Yankees at a distance, they looked like forty-four pound guns (see picture). He even got two observation, balloons, inflated them, and placed them in full view.
The young Yankees took great sport in sneaking down to the cornfields below Munson Hill and shouting insults at

As the war wore on, Col. John Singleton Mosby made many raids into Falls Church- capturing spies, shooting some, and hanging others. A legend that Mosby hanged a Yankee spy from a large pin oak tree in the 300 block of West Broad was handed down from one generation to another until the tree became known as "Hangman's Tree." It was a local landmark until 1968 when due to lack of care it died, was cut down and hauled away.
The Yankees took their toll of spies from Falls Church, too. The Scott sisters, who had been instrumental in capturing a Yankee captain, were taken to prison. Lida Merry, a young boy, was employed, imprisoned, and shot at by

both sides. Mosby, himself was shot by Yankee cavalrymen near Falls Church.
Army pay rolls and family fortunes were buried in and around Falls Church never to be recovered. Homes and churches were ruined by troops and their horses. The Falls Church was occupied by Federal troops who used it as a hospital and later a stable for horses, tearing up its floors and kicking out its windows. Its font was stolen but fortunately retrieved by the quick-thinking lady who was asked to mail it out of town. The fence around the Falls Church was used for firewood. The other two churches received much the same treatment. Fairfax Chapel was completely destroyed by Union troops who used its bricks to make chimneys for their winter quarters. A bureau drawer was used for a trough for horses at "Cherry Hill." Furniture was stolen from various homes. Gardens and orchards were ruined. Houses were burned. Taylor Tavern was riddled in a tragic volley between two Union forces who thought they were fighting the enemy. Railroad ties and rails were stacked and burned. The whole area was ravaged by the war.
The slaves' background in Falls Church was diverse.
The Methodists did not approve of owning slaves but some owned them anyway and others rented them from neigh-bors. One slave, who had been freed and was interested in preaching, sold his children into slavery to get enough money for a church. Another freed slave was so well thought of he became a member of the Town Council in
1881. His father, during his lifetime, accumulated a great deal of land. Seven Corners was later built on part of his land.
There were many skilled artisans among the negro population. There were stone masons, carpenters, well-diggers, shoemakers, merchants, musicians, and builders.
23
Many of the slaves helped their own masters during the war; one had his ear blown off in an attempt to save his master. After the war, when the slaves were freed (includ ing the children of the Negro preacher) many of them continued to work for their masters and sometimes cared for children in their own homes.
After the war, a real effort was made towards rehabili-tation. The churches were restored, buildings were recon-structed, railroad beds were rebuilt, a public school was started, etc. Soldiers who had fought around Falls Church returned to its pleasant surroundings to live and make their homes. During this period of influx the Buxtons, Kingsleys, Mankins, Crossmans, Churches, Duncans, Gor-dons, Edmonds, Fellows, Flaggs, Hirsts, Lees, Mills, Rusts, Mutersbaughs, Leonards, Ponds, Coppers, Mabens, Stead-mans, Piggotts, Nolans, Rices, Rileys, Nourses, and Browns were among the many people who moved into the area-some from the north and some from the south and some from the mid-west. Another toll gate was opened on the southeast corner of Route 7 and Shreve Road. A saloon was opened but the ladies of the village soon closed it down.
The Falls Church Quarry was opened and stone from the quarry was used when the Falls Church Bank, the Falls Church Presbyterian Church, and the second Columbia Baptist Church were built. By 1875, Falls Church became a town, incorporating land from Fairfax County and Arling-ton, which was then Alexandria County (see Appendix).
The first woman was elected to the Town Council. Before 1900 there were nine churches (Episcopal, Catholic, Pres-byterian, First Congregationalist, two Baptist, and three Methodist), a school for retarded children, a town hall, three stores, a bakery, a black-smith shop, a wheel-wright shop, a funeral parlor, a drug store, a livery stable, an Odd Fellows Hall, and a hotel.
Falls Church was one of the first places in its area to have telephone and electric light service. Four newspapers were started in this period. Electric car tracks were laid parallel to the Washington and Old Dominion tracks and the electric train to Washington gave excellent service, running every half hour from early in the morning until midnight. People planted flowers along the Washington and Old Dominion tracks, which had been first laid circa 1857, and paid twenty-five dollars to have a waiting shed erected at their property line. The train would always stop there and the station was named for them.
Along came the Spanish-American War and Falls
Church again was host to troops. Camp Alger was established near Falls Church. Headquarters for the Signal Corps was at the present site of National Memorial Park and tents for the Provost Guard were located at the electric railway terminal. President McKinley came to Falls Church often during this time and Carl Sandburg was among the soldiers stationed there. He lived in a tent, answered roll call six or seven times a day, built a bunk out of saplings, and drilled along with the rest. Falls Church was kind to the soldiers, opened up its homes to them, and tended to the sick. However, water was so scarce that large barrels of water were hauled in from Washington by the army.
By 1919, Falls Church was considered by some to be a dormant village where you didn't count if you hadn't lived there fifty years. Others felt that it was an intellectual town with an university environment (although there was no university). This group formed the Lantern Club which was a very select group of intellectuals who were supposed to meet once a month for intelligent discussion. Al-though, at first, the club was very successful, it finally faded away.
Gradually, the downtown area is changing; landmarks are disappearing. Yet, communities, like friends, are important and the old adage might apply:
"Make new friends, but keep the old.
The first are silver, the latter gold."
Falls Church is located at the intersection of two of the oldest roads in America. It has the site of the earliest ordinary in the Northern Virginia area and one of the earliest known "old field" schools. It has the first church George Washington attended. It is rich in Civil War history and is the first place where a telegram was sent from a balloon. It was a refuge for one man during his Presidency and for another prior to his becoming President. It was chosen as an All-American City. The historical heritage of Falls Church is as All-American as the city itself.



HISTORIC
FALLS CHURCH
INTRODUCTION
Native Americans traversed two main trails that crossed at a point where one led to Alexandria and the other to a favored fishing spot at the Potomac falls, where the shallow water served as the easiest crossing point into Maryland. One of these trails followed a natural ridge in the geography,
providing easier terrain to traverse between the hills and abundant creeks feeding the fields of the countryside. Where the heavily trafficked trails crossed- now roughly the intersection of Broad Street and Little Falls Street an ivy-encased log cabin sealed with oyster shell mortar and containing enormous towering chimneys on either end staked its claim. A wooden church soon followed nearby. The legacy of that first church near the falls of the Potomac River ultimately gave the evolving village its name.
The community around the church grew with the birth of the US government, even before its seat was relocated from Philadelphia to the opposite shores of the Potomac, a mere six miles away. As vestrymen of Truro Parish- the parish The Falls Church belonged to--George Washington, George Mason, and Charles Broadwater were actively involved in Falls Church activities before the Revolution. Due to its close proximity to what became the nation's capital, the history of the country and this small town were and still are inseparably intertwined.
Despite living in the shadow of big government and being a passenger on its coattails through
time. the town managed to maintain a unique identity with a story of its own to tell containing
sumprIsing twIsts.
Wars have profoundly impacted the town and its evolution, as every war fought has swept citizens of Falls Church along not as mere spectators but often as awkward participants. The town's popular ordinary, Wren's Tavern, was the site of much of this history, from getting visits and a recommendation from Ben Franklin to harboring War of 1812 refugees from Washington and even a visit from passing Pres. James Madison while in search of his wife. One of the founding families associated with one of the most recognizable historic sites and community spaces in the city, Cherry Hill, may not have met had it not been for the arrest of an accused female spy during the Civil War.
Military history was also made in the skies above the village during the Civil War as the war marked a key turning point for the village. Falls Church had been devastated by battles fought on its edges and soldiers tromping through local farms, stealing anything in sight. However, many soldiers who fought in and around Falls Church decided to settle there after the war, causing the first boom in population. Leading up to the Civil War and beyond, several key African American families successfully championed equality in education and stature, with the positive impact of their unending efforts felt nationwide.
Influences of war aside, the founders of the developing town laid a foundation of core beliefs in education and community involvement, which have persisted in modern times. Several early families donated the land and financial resources for early churches and schools. Nature and preservation programs to beautify the village and involve citizens began more than a century ago, resulting in several noteworthy historic trees, which are still alive throughout town.
THE FALLS CHURCHES
There is no better place to start than with the churches of Falls Church, given that the town was named after the Colonial-era church, The Falls Church. Churches oversaw moral codes in the Colonial community, mustered the military, saw to the poor, ill, and feeble, and taxed the landowners in their parishes. Taverns, also known as ordinaries, served as local community gathering places to share news and events and also welcomed travelers with food and a place to sleep.
The vestry for Truro Parish was responsible for collecting tithes from the parishioners and establishing land boundaries. The men elected to the vestry were of the utmost trustworthy and discreet character. Most landowners at that time owned grants from the British crown on their plantation acreage. Tobacco served as the main form of currency of the time, with church builders and pastors being paid in such. Little Falls Street was known as the "rolling road," as merchants wheeled casks filled with tobacco to the warehouses and ports in Alexandria, where it was checked for quality. With the change from Anglican to Episcopalian after the Revolution and the separation of church and state, more churches from other denominations sprang up in Falls Church, most of which are still in existence today.

In order to keep pace with the local industry, the village required top-notch transportation for local merchants and farmers to take their crops into Washington to sell. Town leaders also wanted western goods to easily find their way into town. Therefore, the sometimes impassible dirt carriage tracks required upgrading, and a toll was established on Leesburg Pike.
With the advent of trains in the mid-1850s, tracks were laid through the heart of town, acquiring property through several farms. The train revolutionized travel for local citizens and further improved with the addition of an electric trolley line. However, the mass production of automobiles marked the beginning of the end for the financially unstable railway and further evolution of the roads connecting what had previously been remote villages requiring a day's ride to reach.
Ultimately, the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority acquired the land the tracks ran through and turned it into a recreation path. Falls Church was the first city to pave over the tracks to see how residents would use it. The Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD) trail svstem now carries more people than it ever did during its heyday as a railroad. What the trains did do, however, was turn sleepy Falls Church into a main commuter suburb of Washington, allowing more people to discover its fresh air and open land while maintaining federal jobs in the city.

Leesburg Pike was made into a corduroy road by laying logs across it, and the earliest tollgate in the area was set up to help pay for the improvement. In this 1874 sketch, Nancy Williams is shown collecting the toll. Local agricultural economy depended on reliable roads. The turnpike, chartered in 1813 and completed in 1839, carried most of the freight between Alexandrias pot and inland markets until railroads assumed the role in the 1850s.
The East Falls Church and West Falls Church (or West End) stations were only a mile apart.
Wood-burning trains preceded the coal engines. Residents planted flowers along the tracks and paid $25 to erect a waiting shed at their property line, after which the train would stop there and the station would be named for them. During the Civil War, the tracks west of Vienna were destroyed by the Confederates. The military took over the railway from Alexandria to Vienna, re-lettering the only remaining locomotive, Clarke, the U.S. Military Railroad. The train only met battle once, when a cavalry ambushed the military train outside Vienna and it became accidentally uncoupled by a cannonball. The engineer fled at full speed towards Falls Church, leaving the cars behind. The Confederates withdrew, believing the train would return with reinforcements, but it did not. The outnumbered Union troops wearily trudged on foot back to Arlington after the Confederates burned the remaining abandoned train cars. (Both, NVRPA.)

BLAZING THE
CIVIL RIGHTS TraIl
ing early bsequent
While the trails and dirt-packed crossroads transformed into turnpikes and railway networks, another trail was blazed in the Falls Church community. Thanks to the strength and local efforts of both free and enslaved African American citizens of Falls Church, the path to equality was fought and earned locally and carried influence nationally.
A local Columbia Baptist pastor's belief that his black followers should have enough education to enrich their lives ultimately led to his death at the hands of Mosby's Raiders. However, the Baptist pastors left the community empowered enough to create their own churches. Enslaved men braved death to escape and fight for freedom during the Civil War, returning to Falls Church as free, land-owning citizens.
Many of the descendants of those first families still reside in the city, which was transformed thanks to the nationally reaching efforts of the Tinner and Henderson families. The times were not without struggle, and the town and county leaders did not always put the interests of the African American community first, at one point gerrymandering the boundaries of the town to shift the bulk of Lincoln supporters outside the town voting district.

Upon his return from war, George Brice arranged with absent local landowners still away at war to farm their property in exchange for a portion of the crops. Soldiers destroyed most of the crops Mr. Brice raised, and after the war, the Brices filed a claim for compensation of the lost crops. It is unclear if they were ever compensated. Harriet Brice's Southern Claims testimony from 1871 read as follows: "I am the wife of the claimant.

A former slave, Frederick Foote St. purchased about 39 acres from the Minor family following the Civil War with money he had earned working as a blacksmith for
Union troops.
A respected black
businessman in the community, Foote served Falls Church for 10 or more years, first as town sergeant from 1876 to 1880 and then as a town councilman from 1880 to 1889. Foote's land, originally known as Fort Buffalo, was freed for development only after Foote's descendants convinced a court to invalidate his last will and testament, which had forbidden them to allow his 39 acres to leave the family, in 1956. The land became Seven Corners, one of the region's first suburban malls, and a little country orchard transformed overnight into the large Seven Corners shopping center.
On December 14, 1914, the town council adopted the Virginia Senate act approved on March 12, 1912, providing for designation of segregated districts for whites and hlacks. Joseph
B. Tinner (left), E.B. Henderson, and others spoke on the subject.
The ordinance was enacted, and the council's segregation committee was instructed to prepare a map showing the boundaries of segregation districts. (MRSPL, Joseph B Tinner.)

African Americans continue to be counted among Falls Church's notable citizens, and Tinner Hill, settled by blacks after the Civil War, is home to descendants of those original families today, including the Tinners and the Hendersons. The settlement was a short distance south of the town limits, described in Charles Stewart's A Virginia Village in 1904 as "consisting of probably a hundred cottages with a population of between four and five hundred. They have a school building and three churches." Joseph Tinner became an important figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the encouragement of Edwin Bancroft "E.B?» Henderson. Henderson and Tinner founded the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) with Tinner, a great speaker, serving as president. The CCPL succeeded in defeating the segregation ordinance and advanced numerous civil rights endeavors. The organization later became the first rural branch of the NAACP.
Due to their activism, the Hendersons became the target of threatening phone calls, letter, and a burning cross on their front lawn. Despite the threats against them, their efforts not only affected their community but also helped shape the nation. Mary Ellen was principal of the Falls Church Negro School and later the James Lee Elementarv School, which provided quality education to Falls Church -area minority students until local schools were desegregated. Older pupils were bused to school in Manassas. E.B. and Mary Ellen bought and moved into this Sears kit house on land on South Maple Avenue in Falls Church where they raised their two sons. At one point, the house had a barn a distance behind it. Lee Highway was built between the house and barn, so E.B. moved the house closer to Maple Avenue and added a carport.

VILLAGE TO
TowN TO CITY
Pastoral tobacco plantations on hundreds of acres of British-granted land patents slowly gave way to divisions of property into smaller farms as the initial families settled into Falls Church.
The community growing up around the brick church and Wren's Tavern bonded. Still relatively sparsely populated through the Civil War, families began finding Falls Church a hishly desirable location to settle in after the war, including many soldiers who passed through the town during their tours.
Federal employees who wanted to live outside the boundaries of Washington, DC, saw Falls
Church as the perfect country village full of fresh air and abundant trees on gently rolling hillsides, ideal for residences and close enough to get to their jobs. The commuter suburb began evolving around that era. As the community grew, so did the yearning for its own governing body separate from Fairfax County, particularly since the population in Falls Church outnumbered that of any other Fairfax community at one point. Several characters stand out as the anchors and catalysts in Falls Church's path to independence, namely Joseph S. Riley and Merton Church.


## Historical Context
Jeanne Rust's examination of Falls Church as a crossroads community provides valuable insight into how transportation networks influenced community development in American towns. Falls Church's unique position at the intersection of major travel routes contributed significantly to its growth patterns, commercial development, and cultural identity.

# Black Population in Fairfax County

The legislative reforms which led to an election reform with universal white male suffrage instigated little discussion in local publications when compared to the slavery controversy which existed from the time of the Revolution through the early decades of the nineteenth century. Early travelers wrote that local men deplored the institution of slavery, but continued to keep their own slaves. As Elias Pym Fordham wrote in his travel diary of 1817, "almost all of them [Virginians] deplore the existence of slavery; though they think it must be continued, now it is introduced . . . but they (that is the young men) draw the dirks, which they usually wear... . . "[^1] When Anne Newport Royall wrote of her stay in Alexandria and the surrounding county she said that "the slaves of this place bear every mark of good treatment; they look happy and are comfortably clothed, though not half so fine or richly dressed; indeed the white people of this place lack a great deal of being dressed equal to the blacks of Huntsville [Alabama] or Lexington."[^2]

There are many cases in the courts, including Fairfax County courts, where blacks sought to be freed or to certify their freedom, but laws were enacted to make it more difficult for the slave to obtain his freedom. In 1798, an act excluded abolition society members, but not slaveholders, from juries hearing freedom suits[^3] This law combined with the fact that freedom suits were almost always prosecuted in the county courts "where the common county justices preside, and those justices often considerable slaveholders; under these circumstances the claimant must appear as clear as the sun at noon before it would be admitted for tryal." This "destroyed almost every suggestion of hope that any person . . . can obtain liberty by due process of law."[^4]

Gabriel's Insurrection was an attempted slave revolt organized near Richmond which was planned to affect the entire state. This uprising, thwarted at the last moment, plus the revolt in Santo Domingo, Haiti, caused a strong reaction against liberalization of the laws among many, but brought the problem to the forefront for many others. By 1803 the southern abolition societies had nearly disappeared, and further expansion of schools established for black children was discouraged.

There were contrary forces working in Fairfax County, however, which did not make it typical of the entire state. Large slaveholders were common in Fairfax County, but not to the extent found in more prosperous counties in the state. By the early nineteenth century, the Quakers and Methodist Society were quite active in this region, encouraging the education and sometimes emancipation of slaves. Particularly influential was the Adams family, who had been converted by Bishop Asbury in his travels, and who preached at the Fairfax Chapel between 1798 and 1810. Mrs. Ann Lawyer Adams is said to have-been particularly active in converting others, and her husband Col. William Adams, who died in 1809, gave freedom to over twenty slaves. Typical of others within the county, and incurring the wrath of some, was Col. James Wren, architect of the Falls Church, Christ Church, and the Fairfax County Courthouse, who once was a very active churchman and served on the vestry for more than twenty years. Colonel Wren was also a convert to Methodism, and two of his daughters married men in the Adams family who were active Methodist ministers. Sarah Wren, his wife, made provisions for some of her slaves to be freed when they came of age and were educated, and freed all her slaves after her death. It has been argued that persons such as Sarah Wren and William Adams had nothing to lose by freeing their slaves after their death, since they were able to use their services during their own lifetime, and those freed were often old. This is true in some cases, but in the instance of Sarah Wren her former slaves had accumulated enough money so that they were able to purchase some of their mistress' household items and personal goods from her estate. This probably means that the former slaves had been allowed to earn and to keep their wages, while still technically slaves.[^5]

Other persons who were kept as slaves within the county were able to enjoy at least a semblance of a normal life and live as a family group. This is noted in the inventory of William Fitzhugh's estate where a good number of the total 232 slaves were listed by family group. That is, the name of the person, his age, and that of wife and children were grouped together, with the value of the entire family noted:

```
Ben Douglas age30_..... $350
Scharlotte i bs ae re 250
Sintha TA etn. ook 250
Lucy 68 make 150
Franky Dir cian hes 100
$1,100
```

Most of those listed as a family group had a last name, an unusual practice, and some were listed with their occupations such as smith, carpenter, cook, or tanner.[^6]

The law of 1806 forbidding any freed slave to remain in Virginia more than twelve months was later amended to permit local courts to give manumitted slaves permission to continue to live in Virginia if they had performed some act of "extraordinary merit," or if they were persons of "good character, sober, peaceable, orderly and industrious." These amendments of 1815 and 1837 stood throughout the antebellum years.[^7] The initial statute of 1806, however, caused a reaction in other states where freed slaves were apt to go and these other states followed by enacting similar laws, such as those found in Maryland, Kentucky, and Delaware. Within twenty-five years, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee had passed similar laws. The result was, of course, that a freed slave had no place to go except to the north or to the far west, if he or she could find a way to get there.

Some slaves did not wait for their masters to offer freedom, or for the courts to certify their liberty; they bought it with their own hard work. Many slaves bought their liberty with money they earned while hiring their own time. George Drinker explained the decline of slavery in the Northern Neck as partly the result of the "practice among lenient slaveholders of setting a moderate value on the time of slaves and suffering them to hire out at the best terms they could get."[^8]

The Common Council of Alexandria passed a bill in 1806 which would "prevent migration of free negroes and mulattoes, into the corporation of Alexandria and to prescribe the mode of registering the same and to enforce the payment of their capitation tax."[^9] This bill was obviously passed by those in Alexandria who feared that the urban atmosphere might be attractive to persons hiding from the strict Virginia law, while still finding work. The Gazette almost daily carried advertisements of businesses offering employment opportunities for blacks, even though of a menial nature.

The Fairfax County court records quite effectively recount the varying moods of the white citizens in the judgments brought before the court. Many advertisements were placed in the local newspapers, including the Alexandria Gazette, for runaway slaves; the rewards ranged from ten to one hundred dollars, depending on the economic situation of the times and the value of the slave to the holder. Because a slave was apprehended did not mean that he would be returned to his owner, as the records point out.

In 1800, a runaway, or even a free man, was often returned to the former owner at the court's expense. For instance, when "John Bell, a free mulatto, was committed to the gaol of this county, on suspicion of being a runaway being this day brought before the court and on hearing it is ordered that he do return to the state of Maryland and that the gaoler charge the expense of his keeping to the county."[^10] At the same time, if the black man could not or did not produce the right papers, and no one claimed the person as a slave, he was liable for court costs. "James Conner, Gaoler, brought before the court a negro man slave named Will who was committed to the gaol of this County as a runaway and the said negro having remained in for upwards of two months and no person appearing to claim him, and it appearing to the court that he has been advertised according to law, it is the opinion of the court that he ought to be hired out for the payment of his gaol fees at a sum not less than 20% per month."[^11] By 1807, the same situation could apply to a black man only suspected of being a runaway, accruing prison fees of $24.05 in two months. In such a situation the jailer was "ordered that he hire the said negro immediately at public auction for the shortest time that any person will pay the amount aforesaid and that the said negro was hired to Wm. Payne for one year for the amount aforesaid."[^12] After this man's year of servitude was over, the problem was usually the payment of prison fees, often a considerable sum for the times. If the fees were paid, the man was freed. Money was the key, and if the black was able to earn and keep ready cash, then he usually would have a chance to remain free. Some whites did leave sums of money to their slaves in their wills, as did Sarah Wren.[^13]

# Native Inhabitants and Early Development

When Englishmen first came to the site of Fairfax County, the Algonquin inhabitants of the area were of the Necostin (or Anacostin) and Dogue (or Toag or Taux) tribes. The Necostins lived at the mouth of the Anacostia River on the Maryland side and along the Virginia shore and Analostan Island (Theodore Roosevelt Island). The Dogues lived on Mason Neck and the Maryland shore of the Potomac. Both tribes were part of the Powhatan Chiefdom which in earlier years had gathered most of the Virginia Tidewater and Piedmont Indians into a loose alliance. By the seventeenth century, however, the tribes in the Potomac region were gradually pulling away in favor of alliances with the Iroquois nations of the north.

Indian life flourished along the river and the many small streams. The Indians of the Potomac Tidewater were fishermen and corn growers. Their tools were made of stone, wood, bone, and fiber. Throughout Northern Virginia, the sites of Indian villages and hunting camps still can be found, generally near streams or outcrops of flint or quarts or deposits of pottery clay. They offer abundant evidence of the Indian presence.

Throughout the seventeenth century, the virgin forest that covered the Piedmont and the Appalachian mountains was the historic hunting preserve of the Iroquois Nations, and their war parties held the Tidewater Indians in fearful respect. And even the English traders and settlers, anxious though they were to expand westward, would not venture into the forests and highlands of the Iroquois hunting grounds. Thus, the Englishmen of 1720 were almost as ignorant of what was beyond the Blue Ridge as Captain John Smith had been in his day (Harrison, Landmarks). *Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution*

# The Patowmack Canal

George Washington and his neighbors who were interested in developing western lands actively promoted the idea of constructing a canal around the Great Falls. In 1785 they organized the Patowmack Company to undertake this pioneering project. Work began on the locks at Great Falls in 1793 and by 1802 the entire series of canals and locks was substantially complete. President John Adams presided at the opening of the canal for navigation in 1802. Down the river, through the locks, and on to Georgetown and Alexandria came cargoes of furs, flour, whiskey, and lumber packed in flat-bottomed barges called gondolas.

# The Chain Bridge

The importance of having a bridge across the Potomac at the Little Falls was recognized early, and in 1797 the first bridge at that point was built by the Georgetown Potomac Bridge Company. It was a covered wooden structure designed by Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Massachusetts. A combination of weathering and heavy loads caused its collapse in 1804. Another one was immediately constructed, using wooden arches carried by a wooden truss, but within six months it was carried away.

The original Chain Bridge, shown here, was the third bridge built at that site. It was designed so that its 128-foot deck of oak planks was suspended from chains made of four-and-a-half foot links anchored in massive stone abutments, based on a design patented by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. This bridge lasted until 1852, and it was an essential link in the road system by which wagon transports and herds of animals moved from the Shenandoah Valley to the auction houses of Georgetown in the first half of the nineteenth century. *Drawing about 1805; courtesy of United States Commission on Fine Arts*

# Civil War in Fairfax County

As Union troops occupied Alexandria and the northern part of Fairfax County, and Confederate units formed in the western and southern parts, civilian life was a victim of the confusion and speed with which events moved. Outside the areas guarded by Federal troops, pockets of Union sympathizers were harassed by secessionists and driven from their homes.

In areas occupied by the Federals, civilians suspected of secession political activity or spying were arrested. The drawing above from Harper's Weekly shows "the Misses Scott" and their father being escorted to prison in Washington and illustrates the fate of many civilians suspected of rebel activity (Steadman, Falls Church). *Courtesy of Melvin L. Steadman*

Within days after Virginia seceded, Union troops occupied strategic hills and crossroads in Fairfax County to protect the city of Washington. Eventually an extensive system of fortifications was built along a large arc stretching from south of Alexandria up to Chain Bridge.

In the summer of 1861 the crossroads community of Falls Church marked the outer rim of the territory occupied by the Union defenders. Shown here are Union cavalry pickets at The Falls Church. *Courtesy of Falls Church Historical Commission*

During the summer and fall of 1861, McClellan organized, trained, and drilled the new Army of the Potomac. Parades and inspections were held regularly, and led one Pennsylvanian to write home: "When the Major or Brigadier General are favored with the visits of some particular friends of course a big parade must [be held]." This is as necessary as dessert is.

1861 exceeded all others. That day in the fields between Munson's Hill and Bailey's Crossroads approximately 100,000 men passed in review for McClellan, President Lincoln, and other distinguished visitors from Washington.

Later one enlisted man from Massachusetts declared: "This is a day long to be remembered by thousands of people as one [on] the 'sacred soil' of Virginia."

These parades, as well as the other training, gave the new soldiers and officers a chance to assess each other's qualities, sort out the misfits, and develop an esprit de corps that had been missing before. There also were opportunities for small units to patrol and probe the strength of the nearby Confederate [forces].

The Civil War saw the introduction of new military technologies, including aerial reconnaissance. In Fairfax County, Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe, Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, conducted several observation balloon missions to gather intelligence on Confederate positions. The balloon "Intrepid," shown here during an ascension near Vienna, Virginia, allowed Union commanders to observe troop movements and fortifications from heights of up to 1,000 feet. 

These balloons represented the first military aeronautical unit in American history and provided the Union Army with a significant tactical advantage in the early stages of the war. Vienna, where this ascension took place, was strategically important due to its location on the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad and had been the site of one of the war's earliest skirmishes in June 1861.

# Falls Church 22042: A Modern Postal Village

## Source Information
A talk given by Nan Netherton at St. Patrick's Episcopal Church, Brush Drive, Falls Church, Virginia on Friday, April 23, 1993.

## Description
This document contains the transcript of Nan Netherton's 1993 lecture on Falls Church's development as a "modern postal village" - examining how the postal code 22042 helped define the community's identity and boundaries in the modern era.

## Content

Many of the early English landowners of the 1600s and 1700s were men of consequence who acquired large parcels of land. What is now Fairfax County land was in the 1700s first within Stafford County, then within the boundaries of Prince William County, and after it was established in 1742, within Fairfax County. 

Thus one can understand why Catesby Cocke was able to serve successively as clerk of the courts of Stafford, Prince William and Fairfax counties and reside and own land in the same place the entire time. He was an energetic speculator in Northern Neck Proprietary lands and acquired a total of 1633 acres in Fairfax County between 1731 and 1749, most of it within the 22042 area. [Beth Mitchell. Beginning at a White Oak... Grants and Patents] 

For William Fitzhugh, 21,996 acres called "Ravensworth" were patented in 1694. He was a lawyer, commander of the Stafford County militia, a Stafford court justice, and an agent for the Northern Neck Proprietors. Other early surnames in the modern postal village area shown on Beth Mitchell's Grants and Patents Map include Pearson, Harle, Emms, Broadwater, Trammell, Gunnell and Harrison.

There are several watercourses in the vicinity; Holmes Run is the most important stream. Its waters were dammed to form Lake Barcroft, once a reservoir for the Alexandria Water Company. [Netherton, et al. Fairfax County, 1978] Its name changes to Cameron Run and finally to Great Hunting Creek before the waters of Holmes Run and its several tributaries empty into the Potomac River.

In the late 1940s, '50s, and '60s, subdivision building was booming as the growth of the Federal government brought thousands of veterans, their families, and other employees to fill the available work force slots. [Netherton, et al. Fairfax County, Virginia: A History. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, 1978] 

Eakin Properties built the Sleepy Hollow subdivision; other developers built more modest dwellings at Westlawn, Bel Air, Jefferson Village, North and South Woodley, Broyhill Park, Tyler Park, Ramondale, Beech Tree Manor, and Walnut Hill, to mention some of the names.

Holmes Run Acres was a subdivision built on the east side of Gallows Road, south of Route 50, Arlington Boulevard, in 1950, by Gerald and Eli Luria. Several different styles and sizes of contemporary homes were designed by architects Nicholas Satterlee and Francis Lethbridge. The stream valley recreation area running through the community was named Luria Park after the developers.

More than 40 years of monthly Holmes Runner newsletters have been collected and bound and placed in the Virginia Room at the Fairfax Public Library for use of county residents, and future historians and sociologists who want to learn about life in one active community over that time period.

But we have been talking about developments of the past 50 or 60 years. What about earlier times? Native Americans lived right here in many different sites for centuries before the Europeans arrived to stay in the 1600s. 

While the mixed-use buildings, including the Marriott Hotel, were being constructed at Fairview Park in 1985, at Routes 50 and 495, Fairfax County archaeologists were given permission by the developers to spend a full year to recover Indian artifacts from the A.D. 200-1500 site while construction went on around it. Human habitation of the immediate area has proven to have existed almost 2,000 years ago through the work of local archaeologists at this excavation.

# Wren Bio on Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside
## The Big Chimney Tours

## Source Information
This document captures content from Tony P. Wren's biographical work on Falls Church history, specifically focusing on the "By Fence and Fireside" themes as related through the lens of the Big Chimney landmark and associated tours.

## Description
This work appears to be Wren's exploration of Falls Church history through a series of "tours" centered around the Big Chimney, a significant local landmark. The "By Fence and Fireside" subtitle suggests an intimate approach to history-telling, collecting stories shared across neighborhood fences and around home firesides. The work likely combines architectural history with oral traditions and community memories.

Jonathan Lovett, a Quaker Surveyor of Loudoun County, made a map, in Sep-ember 1801, showing the roads from Winchester to Alexandria. When he arrived at Falls Church, he gave it another name: "Col. James Wrens." At that time Wren was not only one of the most prominent citizens of the area, but Wren's Ordinary (Tavern) was a noted stopping place, recommended by Thomas Jefferson.?
Lovett noted that the distance from Winchester to Colonel Wren's was 66 miles, 2 quarters and 36½ perches. It was 4 miles, 2 quarters and 52 perches from "Old Court House' (Tyson's Corner) to Wren's; and 4 miles, 2 quarters, and 73 perches from Wren's to the "Forks of the Road on the levels" (now Bailey's Cross Roads).
Very little has been written about Colonel James Wren. His connection with the life of Falls Church and Northern Virginia is yet to find its place on the printed page.
Any man is a product of his family environment. This is especially true of Colonel Wren, for good architecture was in his blood, as the old folks used to say. His roots include Sir Christopher Wren, distinguished English Architect.
The earliest known ancestor of Sir Christopher Wren was one Cuthbert Wren, who died in 1558. He was a haberdasher with a corner stall "next unto Cheap-Crosse." His ancestors came from Denmark and settled in County Durham, England, in the 15th Century. Cuthbert Wren settled at Monk's Kirby, Warwickshire. The name is found in old records as Wren, Wrenn, and Wrenne. Present day descendants in Virginia use Wren and Wrenn, the latter being most popular.
Francis Wren (1553-1624), a son of Cuthbert Wren,' was a London Mercer. By his wife, Susan, he had at least three children: Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely; Susan Wren, married William Holder the mathematician; and the Rev. Christopher Wren, father of Sir Christopher Wren.
John Wren's name appeared on the Tax List made in 1782 by Josiah Watson in Fairfax County. At that time he paid tithe on eleven whites and six slaves.» He appears on the Loudoun County Tithe List in 1783 with John Urton, Overseer, and paid for three Negroes (five tithes in all). In 1786 he paid in Loudoun County for himself and Negroes: James, Peter, and Frank, 28

The land is here further described as being on the northeast side of the main road leading from Leesburg to Alexandria. This deed made an exception of one acre which Wren sold to Colonel Thomas Ludwell Lee. Witnesses were: John Littlejohn, Benjamin Edwards, and John Fry.30 On February 11, 1796, John and Hannah Wren sold to Colonel Thomas Ludwell Lee one acre on Goose Creek for a mill.

Witnesses were: Charles Binns, Jr., Thomas Swann, and William A. Harding.31 On October 26, 1793, Mrs. Jane Carter, Landon Carter, Jr., and Robert Carter of Bull Run, and others, sold to John Wren, then of Fauquier County, a tract of 277 acres of land on Goose Creek.

(13) (Colonel) James Wren, the Architect of Falls Church, was born about 1728. a son of John Wren (1) and Ann (Turner) Wren. He died at his Falls Church home
*Long View," in 1815. Colonel Wren established a large plantation, "Winter Hill" on that tract which includes the present site of Dulin Methodist Church. His mansion house was on the site of the present-day Ankers House in the 300 block of East Broad Street. The Birch home at 312 East Broad Street was an early building on the
"Winter Hill" tract.
The first record of Colonel Wren is on a Poll (nature not indicated), one of many names, January 10, 1751 (King George County, Deed Book 3, page 469). He is listed thus: "James Wren-107." On May 17, 1753, there is a record, an Indenture of Ap-prentice, between David Bronaugh and Thomas Bronaugh (cousin of said David) both of King George, and James Wren, also of King George. The said David Bro-naugh apprenticed the said Thomas Bronaugh to Wren, to be taught the "trade Suince (Science) or Occupation of a Carpenter and Joiner." Recorded September 6, 1753.67
On October 2, 1755, Thomas Wren was bound to James Wren, as an apprentice, until age 21 years, to learn the trade of "Joiner and Carpenter."6s On July 6, 1758, Kilby (Kilbree) Wren, son of John Wren, late of Hanover Parish, ing George County, and James Wren, of Truro Parish, Fairfax County, joined in ndenture of Apprentice. Kilbree Wren was apprenticed to James Wren, "to be ht the trade science or occupation of a Joiner & Carpenter which he the said es Wren now useth .. " for five wears. The signature of Kilbree Wren gives the frect spelling of his name. Witnesses were: Nathaniel Harrison, Thomas Bro-naugh, and William Brent. 69
On October 4, 1758, there is a deed of record between James Wren and William Wren of Hanover Parish, King George, to Zaccheus Wharton, for 60 acres (corner to Thomas Turner). This has already been given in detail.
John Wren, with the approbation of the Court, bound himself to James Wren on April 7, 1763, to "Learn the Trade of a Carpenter and Joiner." This, too, is detailed
elsewhere.
The first reference to Colonel James Wren in the Fairfax County land records is a deed dated June 15, 1756, in which James Scott conveyed to Wren (then of Truro Parish) the land Wren was living upon. The land is described as 200 acres adjacent to John and Gerrard Trammell. James Wren, Catherine Wren, and their son. Charles

Brent 7 Her father, Charles Brent, made his will in Overwharton Parish, Staftos, Brenty, on August 28, 1755, and this was probated April 13, 3756. In the will he mentions his children: Charles Brent, Hugh Brent, William Brent, George Brent, ment Brent, Ann Brent, Catherine Wren, and his wife, Hannah Brent. He also mentions his friend and neighbor, Peter Daniel. Brent left his daughter, Catherine Wren. three Negroes: Sarah, Moll, and Hannah; also one equal part of all his household goods and stock, "including what she hath already received to be part of the same." Witnesses to the will were: John Anderson, Clement Cheverel, Mary Cheverel, Sarah Daniel, and Mary Carter.
About 1771/74, Colonel Wren remarried (no record available). Colonel Wren married (third) in Alexandria, D.C., on March 4, 1804, to Sarah Jones?* George Deneale was Bondsman at the time of this marriage.
Colonel Wren was listed as a Vestryman and Church Warden for Fairfax Parish on December 20, 1769. His election to the Vestry was on November 15, 1766, to replace Edward Blackburn, a former Vestryman. This election serves as additional evidence of his loyalty and interest in the Anglican Church. As noted earlier, Wren designed Falls Church and built it. His plan was also used in Christ Church at Alex-andria, and Pohick Church.
Although Wren was the Architect of Christ Church, it was built by James Parsons.
Wren did, however, letter tablets on either side of the "three windows," and the chancel of Christ Church, for which he was paid 8 pounds in 1773. The bricks for the Falls Church were burned in his brick kiln on Shreve Road, near "Long View," which tradition states he owned in proprietorship with his brother, William Wren.
As an Architect, Wren had been influenced by works in print in his day, and its thought by this writer that he may have come under the influence of William Buck land who designed George Mason's "Gunston Hall." In 1759 Buckland completed work on the Truro Parish Glebe which much later (under provision of the Act of
1802), was purchased by Wren. S
Colonel Wren was Commissioner of Provisional Law for Fairfax County durin the Revolutionary War, and the D.A.R. records also call him an Artificer and Sot dier. Certificates are on file in the Virginia State Library at Richmond (under Public Claims) showing that Wren received rye "for the use of the army," from his son.
James Wren, Jr., on October 16, 1780. He signed both certificates under this dale as "Jas. Wren, Commissioner." Wren was appointed Lieuterant of the Fairfax Counts Militia and took Oath April 16, 1787.76 It is known that he held the commission of Captain during the early part of the Revolutionary Conflict. Samuel Barker Dark in his deposition made February 2, 1833,7, states that he unfistedin Fairtax Count
on July 10, 1775, under Captain James Wren, and took part in the defense of Alex.
Wren purchased several tracts of land in the Falls Church area as he extended his interests in social and political affairs. He must have been a well educated man, with 1 good business sense, judging from the following extract of a letter he wrote from Winter Hill on November S, 1797, to his son-in-law, Simon Adams:
"Mr. Talbot (another son-in-law) informs me that you are selling goods fast, but must remind you that selling is one part of the business and receiving is another, and you had but a small capital to begin with, so that in the end you may find it a disagreeable business if you are not very cautious who you trade with. I cant help but remind you of old John Muir's opinion 'that a man had better cry over his goods than after them." "
Wren owned land in Loudoun County, and the Tithe List for 1780 (page four) gives reference to the Quarter owned by Colonel James Wren "of Fairfax" and he paid four tithes, on John Hubbard (probably his Overseer) and three Negroes: Jack, Mary, and Winny. The Tithe List for Loudoun County (1782, Part I), gives this information: "Colo. James Renn (Fairfax), David Allen, Overseer." Negroes named Jack, Moll, and Winny were living at this "Quarter" tract in Loudoun in 1782. He paid six tithes in 1785, and John Win (Winn) is listed as Overseer. Apparently this land was the 200 acre tract in Cameron Parish (near the Fairfax border) on Difficult Run, which he purchased on February 21, 1774.78 The deed of that date was from Benjamin Cockrill of Loudoun to James Wren of Fairfax, in consideration of
80 Pounds, current money. Witnesses to the deed were Robert H. Harrison, Bailey Donaldson, Edward Dulin, Philip Adams, William Elley, William Gunnell, and William Payne.
On May 28, 1787, James and Mary Hurst conveyed to James Wren land in Fairfax County on Four Mile Run. Boundaries included: Pearson, Harrison & Reagan Trammell, and along the Run to Gunnell's corner (on the North side of the Run).
This tract contained 145 acres, 35 perches, and was originally granted to George Harrison. Witnesses were: George Minor, Henry Darne, and Thomas Grafford. 19
On February 23, 1788, James Wren, Gentleman, took oath as a Commissioner of Tax for Fairfax County, and his Bond was countersigned by Colonel George Minor.80 He was appointed Sheriff of Fairfax County by Governor Henry Lee, and his Commission was dated November 13, 1792. His Bond in the amount of 20,000 pounds current money was dated November 19, 1792, and addressed to the Gentleman Justices of Fairfax County: David Stuart, William Herbert, and Richard Conway.
The Bond was countersigned by: Benjamin Dulaney, William Payne, George Minor, and R

deline else is known of Colonel James Wren, excepting that he served as a Justice

The only house owned and lived in by James Wren, which is standing,"
* is "Long
View" on Shreve Road. This house was erected in 1770, and became his home after his second marriage. His son, John Wren, later lived at "Long View" after the death of his step-mother. "Long View" has changed little over the years. The original front was from what is now the Lee Highway area, and the house was approached by an avenue of cedar trees. The family cemetery was to the left of the entrance.
Stones which were standing as late as 1949 have disappeared, but twelve graves with dornick stones are still to be seen. A twisted piece of box, burned many times, but still coming back, marks the grave of Colonel Wren. Also buried in the cemetery are Mrs. Robert Reid and children, Sarah (Jones) Wren, members of the family of John Wren, and also descendants of Robert and Verlinda (Wren) Darne.$6 Mr. John Robert Darne (always known as "Jack" Darne), was the last member of the Wren family buried there. Mr. Darne was a great-grandson of Colonel James Wren. "Long View" is now the home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bretschneider.
One of the last records made by Colonel Wren was a deed in connection with the final settlement and sale of the old Glebe of Fairfax Parish, made a few months before his death. At that time, April 25, 1815, Wren was too feeble to sign his name. and signed with an "x.

Wren also loaned her the use of Charles the blacksmith and his tools for three years f he lives so long and at the expiration of that time to be given up and his tools to his wife Sarah Piper not as a slave but as her husband."s Wren also loaned to his wife all the fowls on the home plantation, and directed that she not rent "out any part of the land nor suffer any waste of the timber to be done on the land.
" He direct-
ed also that the land was to belong to his son, John Wren, following the death of his wife, and that her estate which he received at the time of marriage, "be given up to her or her heirs at my death agreeable to Contract by my Executors." Wren gave his son, James Wren, his watch and all his "wearing apparrell," his riding Saddle, and three Negroes (already in his son's possession): Nelly, Kitty, and Lilly. To his daughter, Hannah Adams, he gave three Negroes, Sall (and her two children, lone and Hamon) already in Hannah's possession, and also $200 out of his estate. Wren gave his daughter Mary Dulin two Negroes, Milly and Anna and their increase, these Negroes already owned by Mary, and also $200. Daughter "Catey" Adams during her life was to have right and title "to a small tract of land lying and being in the state of Kentucky, Shelby County," and was loaned three Negroes "which is in her possession named Sarah, Maryann and Reubin," which after her death were to belong to William Adams, her son. Another daughter, Sarah Talbott, was given Negroes Lewes and Anny, already in her possession, and $200.
The main provision of the will was for John Wren, who apparently received more than his brother James. It may be, however, that Colonel Wren provided for James, Jr., during his lifetime. John Wren was to receive the home plantation and all items uned" his step-mother during her life, also "the tract of land I purchased of Mr. as Hurst Except one quarter of an acre I gave to the Methodist Society to build r Church on-likewise one tract of Land I took up adjoining Benjamin Dulany

He also left John two Negroes, John and Julet, already in John's possession, and by a codicil of December 28, 1810, gave him a tract of land purchased from Andrew Rounsaville containing eleven and three quarters acres.
Wren also provided for the heirs of his daughter Betty Hughes, giving her children "Two Negroes named Will and Tonney that I let William Hughes have in the Spring (of) 1806 and at his death they and Jeneys Increase to be equally divided amongst her (Betty's) children. He also gave the Hughes grandchildren $200 to be paid them in equal portions "at their coming of age or day of Marriage." To a favorite grandchild, Verlinda Wren, daughter of John Wren, Colonel Wren left six silver table spoons. He also gave a soup ladle to Virlinda McGruder, daughter of Daniel McGruder. Wren also provided that his debts be paid and "then whatever remains of my Estate that has not been mentioned be sold on Twelve months Credit taking bond and good security and the Money arising from the Sale thereof together
The will of "Sally" Wren, widow of James Wren, was made March 3, 1815, and probated May 20, 1816, showing that she survived him but a few months. 3 By this will she stated that all her slaves were to be free upon her death.

## Historical Context
The "Big Chimney" referenced in this work was likely a prominent local landmark that served as a geographical and historical anchor point for the community. Using landmark-based "tours" as a narrative device was a common approach in local histories of the mid-20th century, allowing writers to create a physical journey through both place and time.

The "By Fence and Fireside" approach connects to the long tradition of oral history in American communities, recognizing that much of what we know about local history comes not from formal documents but from stories passed between neighbors and generations. This work appears to attempt to preserve these informal histories before they were lost to time.

# The Providence Courthouse and Its Related Buildings: 1800-1860

## Location and Construction

The resolution of the General Assembly ordering relocation of the courthouse was not specific as to the site on which it would be built. Accordingly, in May 1790, the court appointed a commission to inspect a site near Ravensworth, within a mile of the crossroads at Price's Ordinary, and to negotiate for purchase of a two-acre parcel.[^23] The commissioners' report was not favorable to the site, however, and negotiations for other land continued until, in May 1798, a group of commissioners was appointed to inspect a site at Earp's Corner (between a road which later became the Little River Turnpike and the Ox Road), owned by Richard Ratcliffe.[^24] The commissioners reported favorably, and Ratcliffe was persuaded to sell four acres to the County for one dollar. A sale was made, and the deed recorded on June 27, 1799.[^25]

Work had begun on the new courthouse some six months earlier, as indicated by the following notice appearing in the Columbia Mirror and Alexandria Advertiser:

> The Fairfax Court House Commissioners have fixed on Thursday the 28th instant for letting out the erection of the necessary Public Buildings to the lowest bidder. As they have adopted the plan of Mr. Wren, those workmen who mean to attend may have sight of the plan.
>
> Charles Little  
> David Stuart  
> William Payne  
> James Wren  
> Charles Minor[^26]

The successful bidders at this event were John Bogue, a carpenter and builder newly arrived in the United States, and his partner, Mungo Dykes. They completed the construction of the courthouse late in 1799, and on January 27, 1800, the Commissioners reported to the County Court that they had received the "necessary buildings for the holding of the Court", and found them "executed agreeably to the contract".[^27]

Within the four-acre courthouse tract, a half-acre was laid off to provide space to build an office for the Clerk of the Court.[^28] This original tract did not provide enough ground for the jail yard and other grounds comprising the courthouse compound.[^29] Accordingly, in March 1800 the Court ordered William Payne to prepare a new survey of the compound, enlarged to accommodate all of the facilities required by the law. The area of this new survey was ten acres, capable of accommodating courthouse, jail, clerk's office, gallows and pillory, a stable, a storehouse and possibly an ordinary.[^30]

The equipping of the courthouse and transfer of the court's records were accomplished by March 1800, so that the Columbia Mirror and Alexandria Advertiser was able to carry a notice its March 29th edition that

> The County Court of Fairfax is adjourned from the town of Alexandria to the New Court House, in the Center of the County, where suitors and others who have business are hereby notified to attend on the 3d Monday in April next.

Thus, the first recorded meeting of the court in the new courthouse was on April 21, 1800.[^31] Meanwhile, in Alexandria, the Mayor and Council adopted a resolution giving to Peter Wagener the title to the bricks of the old courthouse on Alexandria's market square as indemnity for pulling it down.[^32]

## The Courthouse Complex

Among the courthouses built in England's North American colonies, those of Virginia developed characteristics which expressed peculiarly well the prevailing patterns of landholding and manner of conducting local government. Unlike New England, where each small community had its frame meeting house, containing within its walls "all the ideals, political, moral, intellectual and religious of the people who attended,"[^125] the seats of county government in colonial Virginia were centrally located in rural settings. A few county courthouses grew into regional centers of commerce, industry and finance; but most remained independent and apart from any surrounding community, and some may still be seen today standing "as solitary sentinels, symbolic of government."[^126]

It was also characteristic of Virginia that these courthouses were not single buildings, but were complexes of several structures. The typical courthouse compound was enclosed by a brick wall, inside which were a courthouse, a jail, a clerk's office, and, sometimes, a row or cluster of offices for lawyers. Invariably, also, an inn or ordinary occupied a site within the compound or immediately adjacent to it. This style of courthouse may be found through Virginia, dating from earliest colonial times; and, although many fine courthouses are found in the early architecture of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, none of these areas developed the design concept of a courthouse compound.

This design concept was used in the courthouses of Fairfax County at Springfield (1742–1752) and Alexandria (1752–1800); and it was followed in the county's third courthouse which was completed in 1800. The courthouse tract was situated near the geographical center of the County, at the intersection of the Little River Turnpike and the old Colchester Road. The tract consisted of four acres, acquired by a deed from Richard Ratcliffe and his wife Serian. Specified in the deed were structures including a courthouse, clerk's office and gaol, "... and every other building and Machine necessary ..."—the latter presumably referring to gallows, pillory, stocks, and the like. The May 1798 Fairfax County Court Order Book did specify that the courthouse should be forty-by-thirty feet with a twelve-foot portico, the gaol forty-by-twenty, the clerk's office twenty-by-eighteen and covered with slate or tile, a gaoler's house twenty-four-by-eighteen feet, and that stocks, pillory and whipping post also be provided by letting the entire "... building of the same to the lowest bidder."[^127]

In accordance with statutory requirements, space was delineated for the prison bounds. This was done in March 1800, and the area was described in a survey and report of the commissioners, as follows:[^128]

> In obedience to the order of the worshipful Court of this County, hereunto annexed, we the subscribers in company with Col. William Payne, the Surveyor of this County, proceeded this thirteenth day of March Eighteen Hundred, to lay off ten acres of ground for the prison rules of this County, and have ascertained and bounded the same by the following meets and boundaries, ... including the said four acres, the Court house, Gaol, Clerk's office, the brick Tavern, Kitchen, Stables and store house, and beg leave to report the same with the plat thereof hereunto also annexed.—Given unto our hands and seals:
>
> Thomas Gunnell (Seal)  
> N. Fitzhugh (Seal)  
> T. Ellzey (Seal)

Whether all of the buildings mentioned in this report actually existed at that time may be questioned, since the survey plat shows only the courthouse, clerk's office and jail. As to these three, the plat showed the courthouse situated as at present, with the clerk's office almost directly south a distance of about 300 feet, and the jail about the same distance south, but in back and west of the clerk's office. The plat does not show roads or other features of the platted parcel, but the known position of the courthouse in relation to the turnpike supports the suggestion that the brick tavern referred to was located on the north side of the turnpike, the building later known variously as the Willcoxen Tavern, the Union Tavern and the Fairfax Tavern. The other buildings referred to in the report apparently left no traces, for except through an occasional glimpse of them in old photographs of the courthouse, they are not noted in the records of the court.

These buildings formed a cluster which, if it was not all neatly enclosed within the courthouse fence, at least was immediately adjacent to and integrated with the activities centered in the court. In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, the town of Providence grew up around the courthouse, and by 1835 some 50 dwellings and 200 residents were listed.[^129] But the town never eclipsed the courthouse; and, from its commanding position on the gentle hill at the crossroads, the courthouse itself continues to serve as a focal point and symbol of government.

## The Clerk's Office

An office for the Clerk of the County Court was mentioned in the survey of the courthouse lot made in March 1800, and was shown on a location south of the courthouse about 200 feet and east of the jail about sixty feet. According to the survey the office was a relatively small building, one or one-and-one-half stories high, with a chimney at the south end and a door opening on the east side. This office was the depository of all important public records in the county, and therefore was a focal point for much of the activity that occurred at the courthouse throughout the year. A news report in the Alexandria Daily Advertiser of February 10, 1806 called for bids for an addition to the clerk's office and repairs on the "public building," all of which should be in accordance with a plan lodged with Col. James Wren, and constructed of brick "covered with slate".[^130]

During the next forty years, the functions of the clerk grew in both size and importance as he was called upon to serve both the County court and the circuit court. The need for repairs combined with the need for more space required increasing attention to the old building, until, in 1853, it was determined that a new office building for the clerk must be built. Newman Burke, George W. Hunter, Jr. and Alfred Moss were appointed commissioners to oversee the demolition of the old office building and the construction of a new one.

Fortunately, the commissioners' notice to builders, inviting bids on these jobs, was published in the Alexandria Gazette and Virginia Advertiser of July 15, 1853, and provides a detailed description of the materials and construction to be used. It included the instruction that such of the old materials as could be used in the rebuilding should be so used.

Like the courthouse building, the clerk's office suffered damage and deterioration during the war years of 1861–65. When the courthouse compound became a headquarters for Union army patrols, and civilian government either ceased or moved to a temporary seat elsewhere, care and custody of the clerk's office could not be guaranteed. Many of the record books and files were taken to places of safekeeping in private homes. However, many could not be moved in time to prevent them from being scattered, taken, lost or destroyed as soldiers occupied the office building. When the war ended, the task of re-equipping the office and restoring it to usefulness was a major one.

## The Courthouse Plan and Its Architect

The design of the Fairfax County Courthouse followed the Virginia tradition that the seats of civil government should be designed with dignity as well as adequacy for their function.[^139] Consequently, the courthouse building, which in other respects was a plain rectangular two-story brick structure, departed from strict utilitarian design with its open arcade on the ground floor front, and its cupola in the center of the roof, serving as a base for the flag pole and housing the bell which was used to announce the convening of court.

The advantages of the two-story building for innovations in design and decoration were even more evident with respect to the interior. Entered through the front door which opened into the arcade, the courtroom gave the same impression of vaulted space that is associated with the nave of a church.[^140] The space over the arcade on the second floor was enclosed, and presumably used as the jury room. This room was entered from a balcony located across the front of the building (the back of the court chamber) and along each side of the building. At the front of the chamber (as it appeared in the late nineteenth century) was a raised bench, and directly to the left of the judge's seat was a doorway leading into a pair of rooms used by the Court.

No descriptions of the interior of the courtroom as it appeared in the early part of the nineteenth century have been found; but it is probably that the business of the court was transacted, as it had been since early colonial times, at a large table, centered in the main chamber of the courthouse and spacious enough to seat the justices of the County Court and the sheriff, if the business of the day concerned him. One or more separate tables customarily were provided for the clerk of the court and those of his staff who attended the court session. It was also customary to separate the portion of the courtroom occupied by the Court from that occupied by the public, and this was accomplished by installation of a wooden railing or partition. Fireplaces heated the courtroom chamber and a second-floor fireplace heated the jury room above the open arcade. Details of the plastering and woodwork, the lighting fixtures and other hardware are not known, yet it seems certain they must have been of good taste and design, for their selection was in accordance with a plan prepared by James Wren, the designer of The Falls Church, Christ Church in Alexandria, and probably Pohick Church.

Although James Wren's name appears frequently in the public records of Fairfax County during the eighteenth century, his principal legacy was the architecture he designed and helped to build. In the 1760's references to him are found throughout the Vestry Books of Truro Parish and Fairfax Parish.[^141] In 1763 he prepared the plans for construction of The Falls Church, which formed the nucleus of the village which grew up around it. In 1767 he designed the plans for Christ Church in Alexandria. Wren and William Weit were each paid forty shillings in 1769 for plans furnished to the vestry, for Pohick Church.[^142] He had, through design of these and other structures, earned a reputation as the foremost builder and designer of buildings in his locality[^143]—a reputation attested to by numerous contracts, recorded in the Fairfax County Court Order Books, under which young men were apprenticed to him to learn the "trade sciences or occupation of a Carpenter and Joiner."

According to Melvin Lee Steadman's genealogy of the Wren family,[^144] James Wren was born in King George County about 1728, the son of John Wren and Ann Turner Wren. He learned his trade of carpentry and joining there, and about 1755 he moved to Truro Parish, Fairfax County. The first reference to James Wren in the land records of Fairfax County is found in a deed dated June 15, 1756 in which one James Scott conveyed to Wren a tract of 200 acres on which Wren was then living. Ultimately, Wren built a home, now called "Long View," adjacent to the present city of Falls Church, and assembled a substantial plantation, known as "Winter Hill," now within Falls Church City. He also operated, at Winter Hill, "Colo. Wren's Tavern."

James Wren served as a justice of the County Court. He was a trustee of the Town of Turberville which in 1798 was laid off on land near the Little Falls of the Potomac but never fulfilled the hopes of its promoters. Following his military service in the Revolutionary War he held various offices in the County government, including that of sheriff and commissioner of the tax. He acquired extensive landholdings in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties. James Wren was married three times; first, in 1753, to Catherine Brent of Overwharton Parish (Aquia Church); next, about 1771–74 to Valinda Wade, and last, to Sarah Jones of Alexandria in 1804. He died in 1815 and was buried at Long View.[^145]

## The Origin of the Courthouse Design

The architecture which James Wren created for the courthouse—as well as his churches and the numerous private buildings he designed and built under contract or for his friends—reflect the general level to which that art had advanced in colonial Virginia. The styles were adapted from prototypes in England.[^146] Innovations which were made in adapting these styles to American use were, in most instances, attributable to the differences in building materials and the types of skilled labor which were available to the American builder.

The architectural design which James Wren selected for the Fairfax County Courthouse utilized several features which already were familiar hallmarks of public buildings in colonial Virginia, and in particular the colonial capitol at Williamsburg—probably the most impressive public building in Virginia at that time. The use of brick as building material, the use of two stories, topped by a cupola, and, most strikingly, the use of arches, all combined to suggest the influence of this capitol building on the courthouse design.[^147] The courthouse was far from being a copy of the capitol and Wren added to these familiar features several new ones that made the courthouse an architectural innovation in its own right. When it was completed in 1800, the Fairfax County Courthouse was the first example of a new design which architectural historians have called "the town hall style,"[^148] and have traced to English town halls of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Like the Fairfax County Courthouse, these town halls were two-story brick or stone buildings which presented to their front a gable-end, ground-floor arcade (or piazza) covering the main opening onto the street, an entrance set into the end wall, and, frequently, a cupola. The town halls of Blandford in Dorset (1734), and Amersham in Buckinghamshire (1682) illustrate these features with variations of details.

No documentary evidence has been found to show how James Wren evolved his design for the Fairfax County Courthouse; but it seems probable that he knew of this style that was enjoying current popularity in England, and that John Bogue, the "undertaker" who built the courthouse, was familiar with the methods of constructing such buildings, for Bogue had just come to America from England in 1795.

While the similarity of geometric and structural exterior design strongly suggests that the Fairfax County Courthouse had its architectural ancestry in the English town halls of that period, the analogy is weaker when functions are compared. The courthouse for Fairfax County was designed and used entirely as the seat of local government. The commercial activity that was attracted to the courthouse site on "court days" enjoyed no special privileges or facilities in the building. In contrast, town halls in eighteenth century England often served the dual purpose of providing a facility for transaction of public business and carrying on the commerce of the community. The style of the English town halls provided space in the open arcade of the ground floor to house a farmers' and tradesmen's market, and space in the second floor chamber for the town council to meet and do its work.[^149]

The origin of this type of building is not entirely clear. It is difficult to imagine it growing naturally in the political and social climate of the villages which grew up clustered around England's medieval castles and monasteries. At the time when town-and-market halls were common in the central squares of free towns in Italy, Germany and the Low Countries, they were absent in England. Their appearance in England dates from the seventeenth century when town government developed its own identity, and when British political and cultural alliances with the Dutch were established.[^150]

Imported to Virginia as a form of courthouse building, this town hall style became a popular prototype for buildings erected in several counties during the first three decades of the nineteenth century. After being introduced in Fairfax County in 1800, this style appears in the Nelson County Courthouse built in 1807, the Caroline County Courthouse built in 1808, the Sussex County Courthouse built 1825–28, and the Madison County Courthouse built 1829–30. Variations in the layout of the interior appeared in the use of the space over the arcade; sometimes it was used for the jury room, and at other times it was used to accommodate a balcony for spectators.[^151] After 1824, however, a new style of courthouse building may be seen in the public buildings of Virginia counties. Based on the neo-classical lines of the State Capitol, designed by Thomas Jefferson, there came into being a series of courthouses which were suggestive, if not actual, representations of the seat of state government.[^152]

## Justices of the Fairfax County Court

Several notable names appear in the list of justices serving on the Fairfax County Court during this period, including:

**James Wren** - Justice of the County Court and architect of the courthouse, as well as The Falls Church, Christ Church in Alexandria, and probably Pohick Church. Served in various county offices including sheriff and commissioner of tax.

**George Washington** - Served as a justice in 1767-1770, prior to becoming Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and first President of the United States.

**George Mason** - Author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights (which influenced the Bill of Rights) served as a justice from 1764-1789.

**Bryan Fairfax** - From the Fairfax family for whom the county was named, served as justice from 1759.

**George William Fairfax** - Also from the prominent Fairfax family, served from 1764.

# Indigenous Place Names in the Washington Region

## Transcription

"Indian Names.

The memory of the Indians who lived in the region around Washington is preserved for all time in the names of the numerous creeks and rivers. The spelling of these names by the whites has been various, but it is clear that the names of these places as spoken by the Indians sounded to the European [...] very like that expressed by the letters with which we have come to spell these strange and in many instances romantic names.

Near Washington is Dogue creek, which runs through the Mt. Vernon lands and on which George. Washington's mill and the miller's house stood. There are Accotink creek and Accotink bay, the creek also flowing through the Mount Vernon lands, especially through that part of the Mt. Vernon estate which was sold by Lorenzo Lewis, son of Nellie Custis-Lewis, and which about 1850 came to be settled by members of the Society of Friends from New Jersey. Close by Accotink are Pohick creek, Pohick bay and Pohick Church, the church of the Washingtons of Mount Vernon, the Fairfaxes of Belvoir and the Masons of Gunston Hall. A little below Pohick bay, which helps to form Gunston cove, are Occoquan creek and Occoquan bay. It is into Occoquan creek that [...] run flows.

Below Occoquan and flowing through Prince William and Stafford counties into the [...] river are the creeks Maramsco, [...], Quantico, on which the rains of the early city of Dumfries lie, and Chapawamsic. Chapawamsic is a so the name or one of the largest and worst swamps in the vicinity of Washington, and ail these Washingtonians who have traveled through [...] going by wagon road from Washington to Fredericksburg, particularly between Dumfries and Stafford Court [...], will know that no exaggeration lies under the adjectives 'largest' and 'worst.' [...] creek is another of the Indian-named waterways, and so is Accokeek, which flows into Potomac creek, which flows into the Potomac river.

Below Washington in King Georges county there is Passapatanzy, and another [...] run, which empties into the [...] river. There is Metomkin point, the side of Mathias point, and there is [...] creek. In [...] county there is Occupacia creek; in Caroline flow the [...] and the [...], and in Westmoreland are the Pedee, [...], [...] with [...] , and the [...], dividing [...] from Northumberland.

Flowing into the Potomac through [...] Maryland are the [...], the [...] the [...], the Chickomuxen. The Port [...] and the Nanjemoy. There are [...] creek and Kakiah swamp and [...] creek. Chaptico creek and bay pour into the [...], and [...] creek flows into St. Clement bay. There is [...] point in the Wicemico.

Above Washington is Pimmitt run. which courses down through the Virginia [...] and enters the Potomac at Chain Bridge. A little farther along is Seneca run, which adds itself to the Potomac just above Blockhouse point in Montgomery county.

In the region around Washington are the Patuxent and the Patapsco, the Monocacy, Catoctin creek and the Catoctin mountains, Ogequon creek, Shenandoah, Cacapon, [...] creek, Antietam, Conococheague and Massanutten mountains.

This list of Indian names near Washington could be multiplied many times by giving sufficient application to this interest subject."

## Historical Context

This January 5, 1913 article from "The Rambler" column provides valuable insight into the indigenous geographical naming patterns that predated European settlement in the Washington region, including areas near what would later become Falls Church. The article documents numerous waterways and geographical features that retained their indigenous names despite centuries of European settlement, highlighting the enduring indigenous legacy on the region's geography.

The article specifically mentions several waterways in relative proximity to Falls Church, including:

1. **Pimmitt Run** - "which courses down through the Virginia [...] and enters the Potomac at Chain Bridge" - This stream is just a few miles from Falls Church and represents one of the closest indigenous place names to the community

2. **Dogue Creek** - Named for the Dogue (also called Taux) people who were among the indigenous inhabitants of Northern Virginia

3. **Accotink Creek** - A significant waterway in Fairfax County, flowing not far from Falls Church

4. **Pohick Creek** - Another major Fairfax County waterway with an indigenous name

These waterways formed part of the indigenous geographical understanding and usage of the area that would later include Falls Church, connecting the region's history to the peoples who inhabited it long before European settlement.

## Significance to Falls Church History and the Little Falls Connection

This documentation of indigenous place names provides important context for understanding the pre-European history of the Falls Church area and strengthens the connection to the "Little Falls" geographical designation:

1. **Pre-European Naming Patterns**: The article demonstrates that indigenous peoples had established names for geographical features throughout the region, including streams, creeks, and falls, which were later adopted (with varying spellings) by European settlers

2. **Falls as Landmarks**: The presence of named runs, creeks, and rivers throughout the region suggests that distinctive geographical features like falls would have been significant landmarks and likely had indigenous names as well

3. **Connection to "Little Falls"**: While this article doesn't specifically mention "Little Falls," it establishes that natural features in the region typically retained names with indigenous origins or connections, suggesting that "Little Falls" may have been recognized as a significant geographical feature by indigenous peoples before European settlement

4. **Layered Naming History**: The article reveals how place names in the region reflect multiple layers of history - indigenous names adopted by early European settlers, which sometimes gave way to later European designations (like "Falls Church")

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This article on indigenous place names provides valuable supporting context for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Deep Historical Roots**: The name "Little Falls" connects to a deeper layer of regional history that predates the church and community, placing it within the context of indigenous geographical understanding

2. **Naming Evolution Precedent**: The article documents how European settlers both adopted indigenous names and introduced their own naming patterns, establishing a historical precedent for the natural evolution of place names over time

3. **Geographical Truth**: The emphasis on waterways and geographical features as the basis for place names supports the argument that "Little Falls" reflects the area's actual geographical reality and historical identity

4. **Cultural Reconnection**: Reconnecting with the geographical name "Little Falls" represents a form of historical acknowledgment similar to the article's recognition of the indigenous naming legacy in the region

When added to our existing timeline, this 1913 reference enriches our understanding of the layered naming history of the region, showing that the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" not only reflects the documented Civil War-era naming evolution but also potentially reconnects with an even deeper layer of regional geographical understanding.

# Review of Truro Parish Vestry Book History

## Transcription

"We take the liberty of making the following extract from the Introduction by Mr. Goodwin:

'No Parish in the Colony had a Vestry more distinguished in its personnel, or more fully qualified for their positions, than the Parish of Truro. Of its earlier members indeed little has come down to us but their names inscribed on almost every page of the scant records remaining to tell of the settlement of these upper reaches of the 'Northern Neck,' and the establishment of religion and civilization in what was then but a wilderness. But later her Vestrymen are found ranking among the first gentlemen of Virginia in position and influence. Eleven of them sat at various times in the House of Burgesses. Two of them, the Fairfaxes, were members of 'His Majesty's Council of Virginia.' Another of her Vestrymen was George Mason, one of the first among the founders of the State and the great political thinker of his age, while still another was declared to be the 'Greatest man of any age,' the imperial George Washington.'

'The work of recovering and preserving the records was begun by the late Rev. Dr. Philip Slaughter, who, a few years before his death, was so fortunate as to discover the whereabouts of the old Vestry Book of Truro Parish which had been lost to sight for three quarters of a century. Advancing years prevented him from giving the work the revision and corrections he had intended, and the incomplete manuscript was entrusted to Rev. Dr. Samuel A. Wallis, then Rector of Pohick, and at the request of the latter Mr. Goodwin prepared the history for publication. His work in this regard displays the master hand. The manuscript was wholly re-written, and embraces more copious extracts from the records of the Vestry than were originally incorporated. Mr. Goodwin's pen has contributed in large measure to the great value of the work, and it is a book that should be in the library of every citizen of the county. It is sold at the very reasonable price of $1.50, and can be obtained by addressing Rev. Edward L. Goodwin, Fairfax, Va.'

In tracing the history of the old churches in Fairfax, the names of scores of the old and well known families are mentioned. Thousands of their descendants are living to-day, every one of whom should possess a copy of the work. It is rich in historic data and the best of its kind that has come under our observation."

## Historical Context

This 1908 newspaper review discusses the publication of a history of Truro Parish's Vestry Book, prepared by Rev. Edward L. Goodwin. The review highlights the significance of Truro Parish in colonial Virginia, particularly noting the distinguished nature of its vestrymen, including George Washington and George Mason.

Truro Parish was one of the most influential Anglican parishes in colonial Virginia, serving the areas that would become Fairfax County and parts of Loudoun County. The parish was established in 1732, and its territorial bounds initially encompassed a vast area including what would later become Falls Church.

The publication being reviewed represented a significant historical recovery effort, as the Vestry Book had been lost for approximately 75 years before being rediscovered by Rev. Dr. Philip Slaughter in the late 19th century. Vestry books were essential administrative records that documented not only church affairs but also many aspects of civil governance in colonial Virginia.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1908 article is relevant to the Little Falls, VA renaming initiative for several reasons:

1. **Colonial Church Governance**: Truro Parish was the original Anglican parish that encompassed the area that would later become Falls Church. Understanding the parish structure helps explain the early development of churches in Fairfax County, including The Falls Church.

2. **Historical Connections**: The mention of George Washington as a vestryman of Truro Parish establishes a connection between the broader Falls Church area and important founding figures. This context is valuable for understanding the historical significance of the region.

3. **Administrative Evolution**: The article indirectly documents how church administrative boundaries helped shape early community identity in Fairfax County. The Falls Church itself was initially a "chapel of ease" within Truro Parish before the establishment of Fairfax Parish in 1765, showing how communities gradually developed their own identities.

4. **Documentation of Early Settlement**: The article references the "upper reaches of the 'Northern Neck'" and the "establishment of religion and civilization in what was then but a wilderness," providing context for understanding early European settlement patterns in the area that would include Falls Church and Little Falls.

5. **Preservation of Historical Records**: This 1908 publication represents an early effort to preserve and document the history of the region, demonstrating the ongoing community interest in maintaining connections to its colonial past - a value that also informs the current renaming initiative.

While this article does not directly mention Falls Church or Little Falls, it provides essential context for understanding the colonial church structure from which Falls Church emerged and how vestry governance helped shape early community development throughout what is now Fairfax County. The preservation of these historical connections aligns with the goals of the Little Falls renaming initiative, which seeks to reconnect the community with its authentic historical identity.

# Falls Church Town Life and Social Activities

## Transcription

"FALLS CHURCH. Mr. E. J. Northrup has put up a very handsome sign of the 'Eagle House' across the main entrance to the hotel from the street. Thirsty horses are deeply grateful to Mr. M. E. Church for the flow of water in the long trough in front of his drug store, the supply being furnished by his windmill, which has just been put in operation again. The White Ribbon army met on Sunday when several new recruits were added to the rolls. Dr. W. P. Moncure has moved to our town and already has several patients on his list. He was called to Fairfax C. H. on Friday to visit several sick persons. We have no doubt that Dr. Moncure will get a goodly share of patronage of our people.

The young peoples' meeting on Sunday evening was of unusual interest and was led by Lynn Abbott. Mr. W.W. Kinsley made a very interesting address at the Congregational church on Sunday night. There was a very large congregation present. We understand that Miss Mamie Anderson, formerly of this town, will be married on the 13th instant. Mr. Joseph F. Anderson has sold his house and lot to a Washington gentleman. This property is situated in a very eligible section of the town. Mr. Geo. A. Brunner left on Monday to attend the Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows which met in Richmond on Tuesday. Two of our prominent young men created quite a ripple of interest in the town last week by getting married. The first to step off was Mr. Harry L. Turner, who was married in Washington on Wednesday, the 6th, to Miss Leonora Glaze of that city. The wedding took place at the residence of Mr. R. A. Golden, an uncle of the bride. The wedding is described as a very pretty one, and after the ceremony, the happy couple left for an extended wedding trip, which we understand will cover several months. It is said that the couple purpose making Ohio their permanent home. On Thursday night, the 7th, Mr. George G. Crossman, a popular ladies' man, was married to Miss Nellie Dodge, one of Lewinsville's fair daughters. The wedding took place in the Presbyterian Church at that place in the presence of a large number of the friends of the contracting parties, many from this town being in attendance. After the interesting ceremony, the happy couple came to Falls Church, and the bride was duly installed in a brand new house all furnished and ready for occupancy. The groom is the son of Mr. Isaac Crossman, one of the original founders of the town. The bride is the daughter of Mr. William B. Dodge a much respected and well to do farmer of our neighboring town of Lewinsville. Mrs. Geo. A. Brunner is visiting in Petersburg. Mr. T. S. Luckett and E. F. Sneets are looking very sad these days, the three links are broken. Boys better follow Harry's example. Mrs. General Halpine of Washington City, has been the guest of Mrs. Dr. Graham, at her lovely villa, just outside the corporation, for some weeks past. Mrs. Halpine is a lady of fine culture and accomplishments. Born in England, she has traveled extensively; and now at the approach of Life's evening is the delight of her friends with her genial presence and most versatile mind. Her husband, General Halpine, after serving with distinction in the Federal Army, won additional laurels as a poet under the nom de plume of Miles O'Reilly. Mrs. Groom, of New Jersey, is visiting her sister, Miss Sue Riddle. Mr. Yale Rice is building a fine large barn. S. L. Thompson is the contractor. Master Willie Brown, son of J. C. M. Brown, is ill with pneumonia. Mr. G. G. Gaither will attend the Odd Fellows' celebration in Baltimore Wednesday next. Mrs. O'Brien has returned from a protracted visit to Baltimore. Miss Mona Newlon has opened a dressmaking establishment in the town. Falls Church sends congratulations to the new town of Fairfax C. H. Pioneer Lodge had an attendance of 52 on Tuesday night, and the following program of exercises: Chorus—Misses Cora Rathbun, Nellie Hawxhurst, Persis Proudfit, Susie Crossman, Aida Boernstein. Reading—Carl Rathbun. Instrumental music by Mrs. M. M. Erwin. Song Solo— Miss Lillie Porter. Remarks by Mayor Hiltier, John McDonough and Dr. G. B. Fadeley. Messrs. H. W. Lloyd and Mr. Kirby, we understand, will soon open a machine and plumbing establishment in the town. W. T. Sprangle has been appointed District Lodge Deputy for Pioneer Lodge No. 1. Star of Hope Lodge of Good Templars of Washington will visit Pioneer Lodge on April 26th."

## Historical Context

This April 15, 1892 article in the Fairfax Herald provides a detailed snapshot of daily life in Falls Church nearly three decades after the Civil War. By this time, Falls Church had transformed from a strategic military location and contested territory during wartime to a thriving town with all the hallmarks of late 19th century American community life.

The article reflects several important aspects of Falls Church's post-war development:

1. **Commercial Growth**: The town now had multiple businesses including a hotel ("Eagle House"), a drug store, and plans for a "machine and plumbing establishment"

2. **Professional Services**: The article notes a new physician (Dr. Moncure) moving to town and a new dressmaking establishment

3. **Religious Life**: Multiple churches were active, including the Congregational church, hosting regular services and youth meetings

4. **Social Organizations**: The community had active temperance societies (White Ribbon army), fraternal organizations (Odd Fellows and Pioneer Lodge), and regular community gatherings

5. **Town Government**: References to "Mayor Hiltier" and "the corporation" indicate that Falls Church had established formal municipal governance

6. **Real Estate Development**: The article mentions property sales, new construction, and "eligible sections" of town, suggesting a developed real estate market

7. **Regional Connections**: The article shows strong connections to Washington and other nearby communities including Lewinsville and Fairfax Court House

Most notably, the article describes one of the town's residents (Isaac Crossman) as "one of the original founders of the town," suggesting that by 1892, Falls Church had a sense of its own distinct foundation and identity as a planned community rather than simply an outgrowth around the historic church.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This April 15, 1892 newspaper reference is significant for consistently using "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) throughout the article:

1. **Standardized Spelling**: By 1892, the spelling of "Falls Church" appears to have been fully standardized with no instances of the possessive form "Fall's Church" appearing in this detailed community update

2. **Completed Evolution**: The article demonstrates that the evolution in spelling documented during the Civil War period (1862-1864) had been completed, with the non-possessive form becoming the exclusively used standard

3. **Municipal Identity**: "Falls Church" is clearly established as the name of an incorporated town with its own mayor and municipal boundaries ("the corporation"), not just a geographical reference

4. **Community Self-Reference**: The consistent language of "our town" throughout the article shows that residents identified themselves as citizens of Falls Church, with the name firmly established as the community's identity

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This April 1892 reference provides valuable context for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Historical Evolution Completed**: The naming transition documented during the Civil War period (from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church") was complete by the late 19th century, providing a clear historical precedent for place name evolution

2. **Town vs. Geographic Feature**: By 1892, "Falls Church" had fully transitioned from its origins as a church named for a geographical feature (the Falls) to become the standardized name of an incorporated town

3. **Community Development**: The thriving civic, commercial, and social life documented in Falls Church by 1892 shows how community identity had developed well beyond its original connection to the geographical feature of "Little Falls"

4. **Naming and Identity**: The article illustrates how place names naturally evolve alongside community development, supporting the premise that the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" represents a continuation of this organic process

5. **Historical Distance**: The 1892 reference shows significant distance from the Civil War era when naming conventions were still in flux, demonstrating how over time communities standardize and sometimes reshape their identities

When added to our existing timeline, this April 1892 reference extends our documentation by nearly 30 years beyond the Civil War period, providing clear evidence that the name's evolution to "Falls Church" without the apostrophe was completed and standardized by the late 19th century. This supports the argument that place names naturally change over time to reflect evolving community identities - the same principle that underlies the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative.

# Oral History Interview with Harry E. Wells

*Interviewer: Henry H. Douglas*  
*Date: January 20, 1973*  
*Location: Falls Church, Virginia*

## Transcript

This is January 20, 1973 in Falls Church, Virginia in the home of Harry E. Wells, City Manager. Mr. Wells is going to tell us something about his family and his early life in Falls Church as well as his recollections of the old Harmon Blacksmith shop on East Fairfax Street near the Falls Church. 

The Wells family moved to Falls Church in 1972 and we lived at 216 East Fairfax Street in a relatively old home. My parents both came from Catawba Mountain which is between Blacksburg, Salem and Rome and moved to Catawba Mountain and Catawba Valley. 

They moved to Washington, D.C. area and eventually lived in Sea Pleasant, Maryland where I was born and moved to Falls Church then in 1922. I have three brothers and one sister, Claude Wells who lives on Midvale Street now, Glenn Wells who lives in, by the way, Mary Frances Lester, one of the older families of Falls Church, lives in West Virginia now. 

Stanley Wells lives on Highway Road and my sister Shirley lives on Highway Road. We lived on... You said you mostly lived on Highway Road? Highway Road in Fairfax County. What was your father's full name? 

My father's full name was Sherman M. Wells. Your mother made Ruthie? Ruthie Wells. She was a garment and her family was the name that I remember talking about. Garments, real hearts, shepherds, practically, and Wells who lived in Catawba. 

Valley and practically everybody down there at one time was related to us and we would visit at my grandparent's home. Almost everybody in Catawba Valley were related to the rest of the family. What was your father's business or why did he come to Falls Church? 

I think he came to Falls Church just to get away from the mountains and originally but he when he first came to Washington DC he worked for the he was conductor on the trolley line in Washington DC. Within the city? 

Within the city of Washington DC. Then he became connected with Woodlawn Lothropson actually as a carpenter and he was in charge of the carpenter shop in Woodlawn Lothropson, Washington DC. Did he continue to work for Woodlawn Lothropson after he came to Falls Church? 

Yeah he worked for Woodlawn Lothropson until he returned. Oh and when did he retire? Yes a hard question. I don't recall exactly when he retired. I would say 1962. How about the house where you lived on Fairfax Street? 

Well the house we moved into as I mentioned earlier was old and it was an old framed house. An old framed house that was similar to the one that Mises now live in and have remodeled. We lived in that old house for about six years and my father built what eventually was a chicken house. 

We moved in and lived one summer when he really remodeled the house into the frame. house that was there and torn down for the Merrill house. What was the house number? 216 East Fairfax Street was the house number. 

And what year was what year was it torn down? I would think in 1927. Torn down? That's the old house. The old house was torn down in 1927. Oh gee, the own house was torn down when the Merrill house was filmed and she had a very good date. 

But that would have been in, I would say 1964. Tell me again a little bit about what you're telling me about your father's construction of the house. Building the new house more or less right over the old one? 

Well, we moved out of the old house and he rebuilt the new house over top of the basement, the existing basement and just extended the basement out to the full basement under the new house. He used the foundation wall which was stoned for a portion of the basement, and that stoned the wall all over it, so it leaked every winter. 

It was still part of the foundation of the new part. What kind of foundation did you put on the new part? The new part was actually center block and cement. Did the old basement have a floor in it, or just a dirt floor? 

No, that was just a dirt floor. I would suspect that it was used for a root cellar more than anything else. When we moved there, it was quite a little truck farm. It had some 24 apple trees and 5 sour cherry trees. 

Blackberries, raspberries, a good garden spot, care trees, strawberries. Who had operated this or who had lived in this? I don't know who had lived there. Just prior to us buying the place, when we bought it, it was in a very run-down condition. 

But we found out that later in years that Mr. Harmon, the blacksmith, had actually planted the orchards there. I had talked to Mr. Harmon after he had retired several times, several years, and he remembered planting the trees on that particular little farm. 

It was about three acres in there. So it was enough, and actually, we lived. We were able to, under the impression, we were able to live very well, right off of the farm. You don't know who built the house or when? 

No, I have no idea. No idea. The later, after the new house was built, we built a tennis court within the east of our house, almost a lot that was owned by any church. And in trying to get the surface smooth, we ran into an old blacksmith, the remains of an old blacksmith shop. 

So we had all kinds of metal. Where was this? It would be, it would be, it would be facing Fairfax Street, but just, it would be east of our house, adjacent to the Anderson home. And there was a remains of an old blacksmith's charm there. 

Anderson? Yeah. What do you mean? That's the house, the Merrill House is the best reference I can tell you to be there. The Merrill House, then there's a little cape card that's now built on what... we used for tennis court for years right on the corner right on the corner right on the corner of uh this would be the east uh going toward broad street right on the corner of broad and fairfax street there's a barge house was owned by amherst and then it built the brook house the brook is right well that's the small houses the small houses between the brook house and the brook house is uh on the corner and then you come to a small cape cut was built by guard church on a lock and that's where it was uh where we built a tennis court and that's where we found when we started excavating for the tennis court we found the um remains of an old blacksmith shop we had to dig out all the old metal the wires Four shoes, 

we ran into all types of metals that we had to dig out and just throw away. Anderson, who eventually sold the house to the brook, was building an additional his house. I want to introduce you to Archibald, his Archibald Anderson's assistant. 

There's some of his family still living here. you just where they are now, but they're still living there, both Mr. and Ms. Anderson did. But Mr. Anderson's building an addition on his house, and we actually helped him excavate underneath there, and use the dirt from his basement to build the tennis court. 

But we found a bottle that's had on it an Emmy Church druggist right on the bottle. Of course, the Emmy Church was really an entrepreneur when he moved to Falls Church, came into Falls Church years ago. 

He came in the early 70s, I think. Yeah, I don't know exactly, but he, we gave the bottle to, I guess, he had it to Guy Church or North of Church, or he had another son called Elkins. So the bottle was just a small bottle that had an Emmy Church druggist, and we thought it would be important to him, so we gave it to him. 

Did you ever learn anything about the identity of the blacksmith shop? No, never did. The only person that might have been able to give us some indication of it was Bob Harmon, but in those days he was operating a blacksmith shop that would be south of, sort of west of us. 

And it was across the street. Yeah, across the street and down and down. So we never did talk to him about it, and it was just, by accident, years later, I think. Didn't you ever even ask him about it? 

No, never did. This is the first animation I've ever heard of a blacksmith shop there. Yeah, yeah. There's supposed to be two blacksmith shops up at Cherry Street and Broad, where Jason too were close to Charlie Kellogg's house. 

Yeah, yeah. I never heard of, I never heard of that. And this couldn't have been a dump, because you could see these cinders that would be coming, you know, from the coals and things of that nature. It was a heck of a mess. 

When we started, when we first moved to Falls Church, all the front of our land, was you could hardly see the house for undergrowth and we gradually year by year cleaned it out, left the trees in place, came down so we had a tremendous yard. 

The front yard was I would say it was at least 100 yards long. It was a long yard 300 feet at least and that came back to behind the house so we had a tremendous front yard to go. Well now this tennis court in the Blackstone Shop area was part of your property. 

No it wasn't part of our property that was part of it. That lot had been cut out by any church that belonged to him. He gave us permission to clean it up with later when the house was built the little Cape Cod house was going to be built. 

We built another tennis court in the west of the house closer to Harlan's Blackstone Shop. You mean prior to down? Prior to down right and that we played on for a number of years but then all of us went in the service in 1941 and there was no one left to play on it and my father just took the backstop down and just made it part of his front yard. 

When was that little house there in the corner? Since you came to culture? Oh yeah that's a very neat house. Colbert Hunter built that house there. I would I would think that house was built after World War II. 

Is he colored man? He's colored, he's black. Do you still live there? Yes he does. I think Mrs. Hunter is still alive too. Her name is now Brown, and she lives in a house that sits pretty far back off the road there. 

And Colbert is one of her sons. And he lives there. How do you spell it? Colbert? C-O-L-B-E-R-T. C-O-L-B-E-R-T, Hunter H-O-N-T. Well, when did you first start working for our city? In 1948. 1948? As city clerk? 

As city clerk in 1940. You had an anti-connection with the city administration before that? No, none at all. Were you serving as city clerk in 1948 until? About nine years ago when I went to city manager. 

So it would be 49 from 1972 to 1963, I guess. And how long did you live here in 706? I moved here I think in 1950. That's 706 property. You have six children? Six children. Three boys and three girls? 

Three boys and three girls. All the children went through St. James school at Dennis J. O'Connell, except the younger boy who's brain damaged and has never gone to school. Michael now has graduated from George Washington University, and he's working for the Guaranty Life Insurance Company in New York City, and lives at Rockaway Beach in New York City. 

Pat is a graduate from St. Bonaventure University. He was a lieutenant in the artillery, the airborne artillery at the Vietnam service time, came back. And now he is teaching in the Fairfax County school system and lives in Fairfax County near the Charterhouse Hotel. 

He's recently bought and will be moving into a townhouse that will be occupied, that is supposedly in March. Nan, the oldest girl, is a graduate from Marygrove College, Marygrove College of Detroit, Michigan. 

She is, well, Mike is married, Pat's is married, and Nan is married. Nan taught in the Arlington County School System in special education for two years. She has a son now, so she is home taking care of him. 

Marguerite was the next oldest, and she is a senior in Bellarmine College in Louisville, Kentucky, and should graduate this May. How do you spell that? B-E-L-L-E-R-M-I-N-E, Bellarmine College. It was Bellarmine and Erselon College, and both were private Catholic schools. 

Bellarmine was the boys' school, Erselon was the girls' school, and then they combined when she was a sophomore here at Bellarmine College. In her co-educational school. Ruth is going to Marywood College in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

She's a sophomore this year, so she has two more years to go. And, of course, Harry is the youngest boy. He's a brain damage, and we've had him in special schools. But at the present time, he is a... 

I went to grade school here in Falls Church. The first three years, I went to the building that's now the Washington House. Then I went down to Madison School through the 7th grade. From the 7th grade, I went to Grand Junior High School, which was the first grade. 

I was in 22nd G Street in Washington DC for one year. I went over to graduate from Western High School, which is at 35th and R Street. You just missed going to Jefferson High School. Yeah, just missed going. 

In those days, we graduated from Madison. They had two classes. They graduated in February and in June. In those days, if your parents worked in Washington DC, there was no tuition to go to Washington DC schools. 

An awful lot of the students just went to Washington DC to schools. For instance, my brother Claude went to Western High School and graduated. Stanley went to Tech High School and graduated. Glenn went to Old Business, which is in Central High School to graduate from Washington DC. 

Shirley was the only one of our family that graduated from Old Jefferson High School, which was located over on Cherry Street. Then I went into service in 1941. When I got out, I went down to VPI. From VPI, I came to Falls Church. 

I went to work with the city, a city department. I eventually applied for, and I think was lucky enough, to be appointed city manager. I've been very pleased with what people have accomplished for the nine years that I've been married. 

Who did you marry? Kathleen King Kenneth. She lived at 515 West Creek Falls Creek. I didn't meet her until after I had graduated from high school. Her mother died when she was young and she went to school in Philadelphia. 

She was gone nine months out of the year. She went to school outside of Philadelphia. Her family lived in vultures a long time ago. I would guess that her family probably... Lived in Washington, probably longer than we have, but I'm not sure of that. 

They lived in Washington, D.C. for a short while, but moved to, they've been on Broad Street, the house is now torn down, and they moved over to 515. Her father is still living? Her father is still living, yes. 

Good health. Good health. 73. Well, you undoubtedly recollect considerable of what went on on East Fairfax Street when Mr. Harmon was operating a classroom shop there. When you're just, uh, I'm just about, uh... 

Yes, we used to, even before we went to school, we used to visit Mr. Harmon's blacksmith shop as often as we could. It was less than a block away from our house. We used to enjoy going there, especially on red in the snowy days, because all the farmers in the surrounding area would bring their horses in to be shot. 

Because they couldn't work on the farm. They couldn't work on the farm. They were in there to have their horses shot. And, of course, in those days, there were really more horses around than there were automobiles. 

At very seldom, we saw a car going from the center of town toward Alexandria. In fact, the East Fairfax Street was just a dirt road, and in the wintertime, it was almost impossible except for horses and puppies and carriages. 

It was just a dirt road, very dusty if an automobile went down. Very dusty when it was dry and very muddy when it was wet. In the wintertime, you could really only horse-drawn vehicles and wheel-drawn vehicles go up and down. 

But it was fun to go down, not only to listen to the farmers talk about their problems, but to watch Mr. Harmon and his assistant, Henry Simms, show a horse. Henry Simms was a black man, and they were very patient with the kids around. 

Not only would my brothers go with me, but there would be other kids from the village. Very often, the boys from the farm would come in with their parents. After we got into school and got to know those boys, it was on a man day. 

We just got together on Saturday at the next workshop. But he would give us old horseshoes that we could play with. He'd also, every now and then, make us a horseshoe-nailed ring. He was a very kind man. 

It was really an experience to see him fill a shoe to a horse. It was always surprising to me that it didn't hurt the horse. But it didn't. He knew what he was doing. He was the only one. That was the only blacksmith shop in this area that I can recall. 

There were none of these folks. At that time, there wasn't one of these folks. This is the only one that I know of. At the time, it was a two-story frame building. It was lots of... direct equipment around the blacksmith's shoe. 

Or wheels, pieces of wheels, parts of buggies, and things of that nature that would pile up that he could use. Because he did other things besides just shoe horses. He would fix plows and sharpen moral points and sharpen axes and things of that nature. 

Did he still make wheels? No. He made wheels earlier. Earlier I think he made wheels because the upper portion of the blacksmith's shop was in a deteriorated condition. He used it for storage, but he would never let us go up into the upper portion of it. 

But apparently he didn't make wheels there. I've seen him fix wheels there, but I never did see him make any wheels there. But this was a direct route for us to go to the village to these stores. We would go down East Fairfax Street, buy the blacksmith's shop, and cut through the Falls Church to guard. 

The Falls Church yard to go to the store. Where was the store? Well, there were several stores there. Henderson had a, which was a black family, had a grocery store that was sort of on the hill. On Washington Street? 

It would be on South Washington Street now. On the East side of South Washington Street? It would be on the East side of South Washington Street. And near where the old Henderson house used to be? Yes, it would be. 

In fact, I guess one part of the family lived in the store and the other part lived in the house adjacent to that store. What was the store there where this, where Makis's, Bakis's reed? I would think that the store would be, the store would have been up on a bank. 

where the hobby shop is. No, it was pretty close to the road, but you had to go up a series of steps to get to it. No, the house, the store would then be adjacent to the Falls Church, and then it was a house that would be between that and between the store would be right where that little driveway goes in. 

Right, about there. That was right at the edge of the church ground. Very close to the church ground. And then, of course. Was that just a little one-room store? It was a one-room store. The sold groceries and candies and things of that nature. 

But there were, Brown's hardware store was there, and they also sold groceries in those days. It was sort of a mixture of clothing, hardware, and groceries. They still sold groceries there when I came here in 1947. 

I'm sure they did. Then, Abbotts had a grocery store there that where most everybody in this whole area actually got their groceries. So they had everything. That's the one that, yeah, eventually was brought, Abbotts sold to Dawkins. 

Rebecca Dawkins became an EGS store. On the corner, actually, where it became famous now, I guess, because it looked so bad, but on that corner, in the southeast corner of Broad Street, Sam Poho's operated a grain and feed store. 

Across the street was a drugstore. There, that was part of our building. right into part of a house almost all the stores people lived and used lived in. They were living quarters plus a store then lunches the post office for snacks and then next to that lunch on the sort of cars and who were raised there. 

And adjacent to that was a small house that was Abbott's lived in. And adjacent to that was the store that Mr Abbott operated and the people lived in that store. Across the street that would be on the south side of Broad Street gone west. 

There was a real estate office, a bank, these were all framed by the new church. They lived there, had a home. There was another, just to go to the front of the west, sales of having a store where they sold dry cords. 

And then just the rest of that was another home and they were on up. That was old Dr Lloyd's home? I don't know whose it was but there was a two-story house. It was a two-story house right then from there to the next building. 

Thanks for watching! 

## Historical Context

Harry E. Wells (born c. 1920s) served as the City Manager of Falls Church for nine years (c. 1963-1972) after previously working as the City Clerk from 1948-1963. His interview provides valuable insights into Falls Church during the 1920s-1970s, spanning a period of significant transition from a semi-rural community to a suburban municipality.

The Wells family moved to Falls Church in 1922, and Harry grew up on East Fairfax Street. His recollections document several important aspects of Falls Church history:

1. The evolution of transportation infrastructure, noting that East Fairfax Street was a dirt road through the 1920s, accessible primarily by horse-drawn vehicles in poor weather
2. The presence and importance of the Harmon Blacksmith Shop, a vital local business serving the agricultural community
3. Changing land use patterns as orchards and small farms gave way to residential development
4. Educational patterns of Falls Church residents, with many attending schools in Washington D.C.
5. The discovery of a previously unknown blacksmith shop site, indicating the area's earlier economic activities
6. The transition of local governance as Falls Church evolved into an independent city

As a long-term city employee and later City Manager, Wells had a unique perspective on Falls Church's development and governance during a crucial period of growth and change. His memories of Harmon's Blacksmith Shop provide particularly valuable documentation of a business that represented the area's agricultural heritage before suburban development.

Additional significant historical insights from this interview include:

1. **Blacksmith Operations**: Wells provides detailed descriptions of Harmon's Blacksmith Shop operations, including that it was a two-story frame building where the blacksmith not only shoed horses but also fixed plows, sharpened "moral points" (likely mouldboard plows) and axes, and repaired wheels and buggies. The shop was particularly busy during snowy days when farmers couldn't work their fields. The interview reveals that an assistant named Henry Simms, described as a Black man, worked with Harmon, indicating the racial dynamics of local businesses during this period.

2. **Commercial Landscape of Early Falls Church**: Wells describes a vibrant commercial district including:
   - Henderson's grocery store (operated by a Black family) on the east side of South Washington Street
   - Brown's hardware store that also sold groceries and clothing
   - Abbott's grocery store (later sold to Dawkins and became an EGS store)
   - Sam Poho's grain and feed store at the southeast corner of Broad Street
   - A drugstore, post office, real estate office, and bank
   - A store selling "dry cords" (likely dry goods)

3. **Residential Integration**: The interview mentions Colbert Hunter, a Black resident who built his house after World War II. Wells also mentions that Hunter's mother (referred to as Mrs. Hunter, now Brown) lived in a house set back from the road, indicating the presence of Black families and property owners in the Falls Church community during this period.

4. **Educational Institutions**: Wells describes attending what is now the Washington House for his first three years of school, then Madison School through 7th grade. He notes that many Falls Church residents attended Washington D.C. schools if their parents worked in the district, as there was no tuition requirement. He mentions that his sister Shirley was the only one in his family who graduated from "Old Jefferson High School" on Cherry Street, suggesting the development of local educational infrastructure over time.

5. **Property Development Patterns**: The interview details how Wells' father rebuilt their house at 216 East Fairfax Street on top of the existing stone foundation, replacing a deteriorated frame house while preserving elements of the original structure. This pattern of incremental development and reuse of existing structures offers insights into how Falls Church's built environment evolved.

6. **Agricultural Heritage**: Wells describes their three-acre property as a "truck farm" with 24 apple trees, 5 sour cherry trees, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, allowing the family to "live very well, right off of the farm." He notes that Mr. Harmon, the blacksmith, had planted the orchards, suggesting the intertwined nature of various occupations in the early community.

7. **The Church as Central Landmark**: Wells mentions using the Falls Church yard as a shortcut to reach local stores, indicating how the historic church building served as both a physical and cultural landmark in the community's geography.

8. **Mixed-Use Buildings**: The interview reveals that most stores in early Falls Church were combined with living quarters, with proprietors typically living in the same buildings where they conducted business. This pattern of mixed-use development differs significantly from later suburban commercial development.

9. **Archaeological Discoveries**: The discovery of an old blacksmith shop site and an "Emmy Church druggist" bottle during excavation suggests the layered history of Falls Church, with earlier commercial activities being built over as the community evolved.

These details collectively depict Falls Church in transition from a rural village centered around agricultural services to an increasingly formalized municipality with established governance structures and diversifying land uses. Wells' perspective bridges the gap between personal experiences of early Falls Church and professional oversight of its later development as a city.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This oral history interview offers several points of relevance to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Pre-suburban Character**: Wells' detailed descriptions of the rural nature of East Fairfax Street in the 1920s demonstrate Falls Church's historical identity as a small village surrounded by agricultural land. His mentions of horse-drawn vehicles, dirt roads, and farming activities show how recently the area maintained its connection to its agricultural past.

2. **Historical Infrastructure**: The descriptions of blacksmith shops, including the previously undocumented one discovered on the Wells property, highlights the economic infrastructure that supported the area's agricultural character. These businesses were essential services in small communities like Falls Church.

3. **Land Use Evolution**: Wells' account of his family's property, which included apple trees, cherry trees, and various other crops, documents the transition from agricultural to residential land use, providing context for how Falls Church evolved from its historical roots.

4. **Community Identity**: As someone who served in city government for over two decades, Wells' perspective on community development helps establish how Falls Church's identity evolved during the mid-20th century, which is relevant for understanding how place names and community identity interrelate.

5. **Historical Preservation Values**: The interview itself represents efforts to preserve Falls Church history through oral testimony, demonstrating the community's long-standing interest in maintaining connections to its past - a value that also underlies the current renaming initiative.

While this interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides essential context for understanding Falls Church's historical character during a transformative period, reinforcing the initiative's goal of reconnecting the community with its authentic historical identity. The interview helps establish the agricultural and small-town character that defined Falls Church before suburban development transformed the landscape.

# Oral History Interview with Elizabeth Morgan Styles and Judy Sides

*Interviewer: Henry H. Douglas*  
*Date: January 15, 1971*  
*Location: Falls Church, Virginia*

## Transcript

You have any idea what the cords might have changed? Mr. Orland, ma'am. Well... But that part didn't change until after we came, because they still had that, they had been taken off after. And they were still there. 


They were still on the house when we came down here in 1980 to live. So it would have been sometime after nineteen. It was sometime after nineteen eight. But I just don't remember dog. Are you human? 


Well, do you remember the breakfast dog? What can you tell me about the name Cherry Hill? Well, I can't tell you, Mr. Randi, when they named her, the only thing that I have always heard, and I don't know whether Judy has heard this or not, that, what? 


There was a cherry lane now. Yes, yes. Down on Broad Street, there were iron gates, and the lane went all the way down to Broad Street. There wasn't a park everywhere. And they had... I know these cousins of mine, the way they met my grandmother and grandfather, they were driving from Washington out here one day and they had to go down Broad Street and they saw this lane, it was in the spring, and the lane had cherry trees and lilacs in between. 


And they said it was the most beautiful sight they had ever seen. So they drove up the lane and wanted to know if my grandmother would take them for the summer. And grandmother said no, she'd never done anything like that and she didn't want she has to take them out. 


But after a while they persuaded them to take them for the summer and they came out and spent several summers with them. So that's the way the fact. I've always heard that story of how beautiful that lane was and that's where I've always understood the reasons. 


But it's been called Cherry Hill as far back as anyone remembers, but it's not a recent thing. Yes. Oh, no. I, as far as I can remember, I remember them calling. referring to this child as a child. You said the changes in the, in the courts were made about nineteen-eight. 


Well and now the changes in the courts were made after nineteen-eight. After nineteen-eight. After nineteen-eight. But I cannot tell you. My memory doesn't go back to when. Just when those were made. 


Well what about other changes in the house or changes in buildings outside and that sort of thing? Oh well I can say this. I can tell you some of the changes on the interior of the house. The main room on the right hand side, the living room, which it is now, used to be my grandmother and grandfather's bedroom, it had another room there which was just about the width of the, as you know there are two windows on the side facing the garden. 


And the room at the back had, was just about the width of the window, a little bit farther than the distance of the window. And it had cut off, we used to call that. the company died whenever they had company did you remember that you don't remember that oh dude that's been a new I'm sure that they didn't change that until, well they didn't change that until after we left the house. 


Oh, I remember the roof. I never heard of the coal company then. Yeah, we all, that's what they call the coal company. I remember the room very well. Well, we used to have them, we first went down there to live. 


When we had company, we always had bathroom reviews. It was rather narrow and rather small. We had time getting around things, but just the same. That's where we had company in that dining room. But in, let me see, the grandmother died in 1927. 


We left there in June of 27. She died in March, and we left there in June of 27. And up the little house on the corner of Park and Little Falls Street. And it was that next year, so it must have been 28 or 29, my uncle tore the petition out between the living room and that small room and made it one large room. 


Then he also built up the kitchen. So you, uh, you step up to the kitchen, you still do, or do you, well I didn't realize that, well, then they didn't, then they did do anything to it. You step up to the kitchen, you didn't, uh, I thought, Well, I didn't know there were any steps now, but anyway, there is one ball, and then they did do away with one step, because there were two steps up there, and they remodeled the kitchen, 


and that was in, as I say, 28 or 29, when that was done. That was pretty complete, right? Yes. Did you say re-bottle? Do you think they started with what was there, or did they tear down what was there and rebuild? 


No, well, they started with what they had. They didn't tear the building down. No, they didn't have the building there. Well, what about buildings outside, like Melbourne interviewed Mrs. Gage in 1965, she gave me a copy of it, and she talked about the smokehouse, the greenhouse, the summer house, eight-sided. 


But not really very much information about what I wondered if you knew about any of those. I don't remember about any of those. I don't remember that either. I don't know where the smoke house was. The only thing I know are the corn cliff and the barn with the tool house and the shed. 


The chicken house is gone now and those are the only buildings that I know. There wasn't until last year a pile of logs out the back. from a building somewhere on the property. Because that's the most recent building that's gone, that I know of. 


And that was right out the back of the house. Thank you. Just across just across the driveway Back under the English Walnut And the chicken house right beside that Well, I never do anything about the smokehouse No, the summer house, I've never been like that before. 


that's something that seems strange to have the family and living there as I did for so many years not to hear anything about but I don't remember mother ever saying that somehow I thought Judy could probably supplement a lot of things maybe that I couldn't well this part about mister harvey and his plants and landscaping and that sort of thing well uncle harvey I really and truly did a perfect deal. 


wonderful thing. He practically made start at the rose garden. on the side across the fences down now that would have been turn of the century or later. Oh, yes. He started that before we came. came to their elite. 


So it must have been just about, then in my day, he, I'll tell you all those beautiful magnolias that he has on the place, were seeds that were picked up from the magnolia trees on the museum grounds. 


And he brought them out here and planted them. And then, that's the Smithsonian. Yes, the Smithsonian. Because, you see, he was in our college. Right. And he was in the Smithsonian, or the museum, museum, not the Smithsonian Museum. 


And he also, where the city hall is now, in his day, he had that whole thing from the Rose Garden to Little Falls Street in Pimps. And it was the most beautiful thing. And, as I said, we reap the benefit of those, faced the field, you know, as we used to call it, and the peony field. 


But it was the most beautiful thing, and he had gone into it really very extensively. He used to sell them, and he had some very valuable, not balls, what do they call them? Tubers. Tubers, I think. And so, but, after he, I think that was about a year or so before he died. 


It wasn't a duty that he gave a cup more or less. And, uh, I don't know, but did he give those groups to somebody, or to people? Well, yeah, I think he did too. Yes, well, of course. So, and then... There were numerous plants and things around that valuable things that he had bought and put on the place. 


And that, and that, and that, and that, and that. begin with, in my day up until the time we left the place, it didn't have a flooring very much except just wood floor, yes. Good flow up. Now it's a cement flow up. 


That's right. Yes, which I hope they take care of. Well, in my day, it was used to keep the cow on the horses, and they'd go deck-and-the-cow. That's the only thing, of course, they had hay. in the barn, in the barn. 


But other than that, it was more or less historic. They had some of their, well, tools and things that weren't kept in the tool house, like rakes and things more or less were kept in the barn. Have you ever heard stories about Civil War soldiers' names being called? 


Yes, I've heard my mother tell that lots of times. Well, tell me. Well, the only thing that I can tell you is that they, I don't know any names or anything like that, but she said that they were on the inside of the barn and the walls were the names of the soldiers of the Civil War. 


Oh, yes. That's where you can see all this grain and stuff out there. The shells of the sunflower seeds out there. That's a good looking squirrel. Yes. Well-fed. Well-fed, right? I'm sorry. You were telling me about the names of the barn. 


Yes. Well, they found that, oh, well, mother said, I've heard mother tell this many times about that there were names in the barn and the soldiers of the, apparently, the soldiers. station around there. 


But that's all I know. Were the cars interfering? Judy, I think that some of them are painted, I think. Do you remember where at the bar? No, I don't remember where. Well, what about the Have you ever heard stories about that being used to hide soldiers or about soldiers' names being cut? 


Well, I've heard the, I've heard, I've heard the story that they, that they used to have soldiers. I don't think I ever heard that they had soldiers. names and did I forgot but I you won't believe me when I tell you this up until we left there there was only a ladder that went up to that and I don't think I've been that adequate once in my life So, and I think I did walk there once after footsteps up there But that's the only time I never would go before, 


because I'm afraid of that later. Later. It was a, I'll tell you, the latter, when it was, the room was used before it was turned into a bathroom for storage room. And it had just a board over it. And there were steps coming up. 


They were where the back steps were, you see. And they put this, these boards over in place, which didn't look very secure to me. And then, what? Just sort of covered the steps. And it didn't look very secure to me, so that's one reason I never went up in the attic, because I was afraid of that latter and no steps, because it didn't look very secure. 


And so I never went, but I went up once. After a couple of steps, that's all. I've never been up to those steps again. I know they are. They're like a ladder. They're a little bit narrow. What about ghost stories? 


Have you ever heard any ghost stories about the house? Oh, I've heard lots of ghost stories about it. I can tell you some that really and truly that have happened in my day when I was there. Oh, please. 


I have gotten up, and I'm not the only one that's done this, that we have heard people coming down the stairs. And I have gotten up to go out and see who's come downstairs, because I knew everybody was around that should be around, and I wondered what was happening. 


And I've gotten out of the hall to see who's come downstairs. And another thing, and this has happened many times, and as I say, I can vouch for this. The door between the living room and the dining room and kitchen. 


Had a latch, a little latch on it, not the doorknob door, but you know a latch tackle it. And we'd be sitting there at the table And suddenly that latch would lift and everybody would stop and wait and see who would come in. 


Nobody came in. And that is actually true. Those things have happened in my day there. Oh, that's true. And so people don't believe that, but that is absolutely true. I can see, I can just see it now while I'm sitting at the table and the latch would go up and everybody would stop and wait and see. 


They'd turn around to see who was coming in and see nobody there. Everything stopped right then and there. Those are the only two ghost-like things that I can tell you about. But those two I have witnessed myself. 


And, uh, would you ever hear anybody tell any others? No, I don't think that. Have you ever heard your mother tell any others? No, I never have I. But I'll tell you a funny thing that happened to me when I was a little girl. 


I had to live. My grandfather's brother was living, Uncle George, with my great uncle. And, uh, he, uh, always, of course, I was the first of the family. This is Alfred the leaguer of the family, the beginning and the end. 


And, uh, so I, being the oldest of the family, we used to come down in the spring and the fall to visit my grandmother. And, uh, so Uncle George, as I said, I was, of course, by that time, my brother was born. 


And, uh, but, uh, just the same, as I say, I was number one branch owner. So he used every time I'd come down. when I come down in the morning to breakfast. Uncle George would be waiting in the middle of the stairs for me, and about the fourth or fifth step, he'd say, jump, Elizabeth, jump. 


And I'd jump, and he'd always catch me in these arms and take me out to breakfast. So when he passed away, which I think was about 98 in there sometime when Uncle George died, we were coming down to visit Grandmother, and Mother tried to prepare me for the fact that Uncle George wasn't there. 


there, that he had gone and I can see it now when Mother's sitting on the sofa telling me I'm gonna start out with John, I thought that George had gone to heaven and so forth and so on. And so when we went down to visit, I went down. 


One morning to breakfast. I had gone down one or two mornings and never thought about it. there, but I was going down to breakfast that morning and standing at the foot of the stairs was on the charts, just as plain as could be. 


And he said to me, Elizabeth, jump, Elizabeth, jump. and Elizabeth jumped, and I had a skin nose, and I had two other things at the time, but that actually happened too, and so I don't know what you'd call that, but anyway. 


But I was always very close, Dr. George, because I remember you used to take me down to Linda Mankins, and I don't know whether you know Linda Mankins is the old, well, Linda Mankins is a very close relative of Melvin's head. 


And she used to have the corner store in Falls Church, a dry goods store, and little, you know, these general stores in small towns, but she always had candy and things like that too, so but George used to take me down to Linda Mankins and find me the penny candy. 


But at home, I wasn't allowed to eat, because we were only allowed to eat, as I had said to the old girls we had made. We had, every Friday, she made gingerbread and taffy, and we weren't allowed to have anything else but this, because it was her name, and of course, we lived in Pennsylvania at the time. 


It was a treat for me, for that in the store, to have these marvelous candies. a penny this and a penny that, you know. So I, so all of George used to take me down, carry me down the store, and get these penny candies for me. 


And I know Mother didn't approve of them, but just the same, she did the same thing. So I enjoyed them. But, that's all. I can remember the only one thing of my infancy, mother wasn't very well at the time, Judy's mother came up to Philadelphia and got me and brought me down here. 


It was a Christmas time. And, of course, we didn't know anything up there but snow and things like that. and this Christmas of course they were doing everything they could to make me happy and of course I knew I was home safe and so well but it was one of these warm Christmas that we don't have anymore but the temperature but now you won't believe me but I tell you this story the temperature was set all the windows were open and the roses were blooming in the garden the rose were blooming in the garden the temperature was all the windows were open and I can remember Just as well as I went upstairs and I cried and I cried. 


I wasn't used to Christmas that didn't have snow and ice and everything like that, so that was Christmas, part of Christmas for me. And so that was one of the, I think, one of the most homesick times I ever spent in all my life, I think, was that Christmas here. 


And of course everybody was being so lovely to me and trying to make me feel as much home as I possibly could. What about other Civil War stories about the house, like the Battle of Peach Orchard or that sort of thing? 


Well, I was going to tell you that they always said that, you know, between Mr. Gage's and the house was supposed to be the peach orchard down there, and that's where they always said that the Battle of Peach Orchard took place. 


But there's been a dispute about that, so I don't know, but that's what we've always heard. Can you remember some of the stories you heard about it? And mothers said that they used to, after they moved out there, they used to dig up all kinds of things. 


In fact, somewhere around here, I have buttons off uniforms and things that my mother, that they've dug up out of that, and the peach orchard in that area. Well, the peach orchard was certainly there in 1861 because they found a Civil War survey which shows behind the peach orchard. 


Well, the peach orchard was there. The peach orchard was there in my day, my early days. It was there in 1861, too, so it would have been available for the Battle. Well, the mother said that mothers told that, and I had several buttons and things off uniforms that were dug up out of it from the beginning. 


And then, where the pine trees are, down across in the library, that was an apple orchard there. Who planted the pine trees? Uncle Harvey did. Remember about what time? Judy, you didn't plant that till around. 


Not till around. No. I was going to say... I think that was after we left the place, too. I think it was after nineteen-eight sometimes. No, it was after nineteen-twenty, yes. Nineteen-twenty-seven was after nineteen-twenty-seven. 


That's interesting, because we're having a sort of discussion about those yesterday, and white pines grow relatively fast. And I said it would surprise me if they were over forty years old. Well, I think you're about right. 


I think you're about right, Mr. Rand, there are. That's about what they look like. No, because for just about that time, they were tiny. Now... It used to be a road that came up there. Yes. And then I had to follow Bear Rowley through here. 


When was Park Avenue cut in front of the house? I don't know, Judy. The first map that it shows up on is 1917. for that the road goes on the way to Broad Street. But there is a big gap in the maps. Well, there is a big gap, because I'll tell you, there was a, oh, I'll tell you, that was before 1917, because it was just a dirt road that was terrible. 


And I don't know, but that, back in my very early childhood, I don't remember, I can't, just can't remember. But, To me, that road has been there for a good many years. Yeah, it was a little third road. 


Yes. Yes, that's right. You're right in front of the garden. Right in front of the garden was a terrible place. Well, I know even at the time that my father was on the town council, and something was said about, well, it said now, John, the town council all fixed the road. 


He said, no, that's just exactly what everybody said. Well, I was on the town council now for the road, you see. He had to get out of the road. So Dad wouldn't have anything done about it for that reason. 


So I don't know just when the road was after all. Dan was on the town council. I don't remember where that was many years ago. And, uh... So... Well, I wish I could remember well, I'll tell you another thing too back of the barn Right there at the side Grandfather had his guard Of small vegetables and things and he had his little nursery his hot Hotbed They're too long last in just to the side and he had There were several old delicious grape arbors back there He had let me see there were one two Three where they I'll tell you where that they rose garden just outside the rose garden and near the gate what could be the upper part of it was a grape arbor there in my area then there was a grape arbor just across the road from the back of the of the house now i don't know is that still there well there were had lovely grapes back there then back of the of the um chicken house was where he had his he had uh gooseberries and currants and blackberries and red red bass berries red blackberries were his berries all back right back in chicken house and i'll tell you something else that was on that place that i don't think anybody's ever heard of he and was brought over by uh mr harvey the englishman who owned the place and there were white blackberries now i remember those and they were down in the front right across the front of the box bushes on the other side and there were a few bushes in those white flower fairs when i was living when i lived there and i remember those when we first came down here what about that box ollie i brought that's supposed to be something that harvey brought yes he brought those that's english box from three bucks i mean he brought those so and i don't know where the harvey planted the cherry trees and the lilacs not you any idea what happened to him no i haven't i have a sized idea what happened and another thing not only did they have all those great but back of of the barn right for the side of the little uh garth vegetable garden. 


He had his fight grapes. to fight sweet breaks that have to be delicious. Um, how would you like if you have some? free time and feel so inclined to sit down with a sheet of paper, you know, and we can put the buildings on it as they are now, and then use the markings. 


and where gardens were, where you and other great barbers being and that sort of thing. Well, I wouldn't mind, would you help me? It would be extremely bad if it was something we don't have. Well, I'd be very glad to do it, because I, a chariot was very close to me, because it was my home for many years. 


And I have a very, very close feeling of chariot. And I just loved, what my memory of that place, I would love to sit down. So, you know, everybody would have, well... It's important, and it's valuable, you know. 


Well, I'd be very glad to do it for you sometime. Okay. Great. I think the reports developing is a pretty good one, I think. You'll be sort of pleased with it. Oh, I'm very interested to see this report. 


Well, somebody asked at least even some more time about it. a report of his which he hadn't yet written and they said I'm interested in seeing if he said so am I. Well, I'll tell you another thing about the old house. 


And I think my uncle has now, where the furnace is, he's put in a cement base, you see. Well, that was all just early downtown. And Mother used to tell how all of them, really, there was a great competition when it came to churning time, because they were all the most embedded readers you ever heard of in your life. 


That whole family just read. Every time they'd get their books, they'd get their hands on, they'd read. Everybody in the family read. And so the girls were all willing to go down through the churning, because they could take a book down there in the basement. 


It was nice and cool in the summertime. It was the coolest place in the summertime, so they'd take the books and go down there and read, you know. So, Grandmother, I didn't have any trouble getting it if I was to churn it for her. 


I understand from Melvin's book that James Whitcomb Riley was a relative of the family. Well, my grandfather, James Whitcomb Riley's father, her brother's. I wondered if he ever visited a cherry hill. 


Yes, he did. Good. Well, we've always said, and I don't know how true this is, but the poem that he wrote, out at O'Rack Mary's, out at Mary's, it was never O'Rack Mary's was ever O'Rack Mary's I think that's what's called was about my grandmother, but I'm not positive. 


We're not positive about that Well Tell me something about sometimes when he was there about other visitors to the place that we might know All I do know is that he used to come down there No, oh, no, I never met him But my now a little story my grandfather wasn't he's very particular about his daughter's So he wasn't very keen about But he did Well, what about other visitors in there? 


I don't know that... and then other institutions there to write a poem. If they were, I don't think that was the family I was thinking about. What was life at Cherry Hill like as you first remember it? 


What was the village like around it, that sort of thing? Well, it was, to me, it was a delightful little village. It was a village, a real honest-to-goodness village, and where you had about two or four brick sidewalks that the Village Improvement Society built. 


And then they had the... Yeah, I don't know. what do you call them, the lamps, the oil lamps on the streets, and nearly everybody in town, as far as I can remember now, most of the people had about an acre of ground, anybody's anniversary, a half an acre to an acre of ground, and the place was just, everybody knew everybody, and they, there was just a delightful atmosphere about this town, and I can't get over it. 


I still have got the village, and I refer to it to this day, now say I'm not going to, I'm going to the village, and they all say, well that dates you, I say, alright, you can date me, I'm very, very proud of that date, but I'm still going to the village, and that village was still a village in your day lately. 


I know, I'd say if you're going to the village, you can look at it somewhere for that. I think it had started to more or less build up to a certain extent after you were born. No, not too much, I guess it was. 


What about you mentioned the street lights? What about lighting the house itself? Oh, let me tell you. I can tell you that. I can tell you all about that very, very recently. Because there was no electricity in that house. 


There was no water in that house. Everything was brought in from the well. And we had outside conveniences, and up until the time we left that house. That was 1927. all over the place was heated by stoves. 


I'll tell you the remark, but still. And those of us that didn't have a hagi heater in our room had little oil stoves in our room. and a wood grain. And I have, now you won't believe me when I tell you this, but I've had the, I've had to break the ice on my, in the picture in my morning when I wanted to wash in the morning, I've broken the ice in my picture, you won't believe that, but that is. 


That's true. But it was really delightful, and I looked back on it, even with all the inconveniences and everything, I thought, well, you know, you had a very happy life. Well, I think sometimes we certainly get, we learn to expect so much, and we want so much more than what we've enjoyed. 


That's right, that's right. That's right that we have. That's right. That's maybe one of the qualities of present-day life. Well, I remember a grandmother's room was downstairs, but he's living in there. 


and she had a great big hand, and we often used it. Gather around that and get good and warm before we rushed upstairs and crawled into bed, but I remember I was privileged to have that soap stone. What happened to that old soap stone? 


Well, the grandmother had an old soap stone. We used to keep that on the back of the stone. And before I went to bed, I'd go and get that soap stone and wrap it up. a piece of woolen cloth or something and run upstairs to bed with that thing and put it in bed. 


Even then, as I said, I looked back on those people, and as I said, I looked back and I think, what is that? So, I wasn't sweet 16 that time, I. The benches on the front porch. They've always been there. 


I've never known that porch without benches. So, I just don't lie. But those benches were there back in my day. So, I don't know whether they originally came to the house or not. I don't know. Oh, that's certainly beautiful. 


What can you tell me about, well, Mr. Harvey was an ornithologist. Did he do work or experimentation or classification or anything, that type of home, or was that all done for the museum? Well, most of that part was done in the museum. 


He was, when Roosevelt, Teddy, went and took his trip to the Africa, he was going down. he of the Harvey had been selected as the ornithologist to go with him. And this is one thing I've ever quite forgiven my dear grandmother, my daughter and I loved her. 


But she wouldn't let him go. And I always felt so sorry for my uncle for that reason. But he went on several other expeditions. He went to the Bahamas, as the ornithologist at the Bahamas, and he went up to Canada and forgot about Canada. 


Do you have a copy of this obituary? Mr. Wren, I think I have. I'll have to look it up, but I think I have it somewhere. I think I have it someplace. Because I plan to go down to the Library of Congress and look for it. 


You've had it never saved any trip. Well, I'll have to look for it, because I'm right in the throes now, and if you can see mine then. There are carts and carts that my mother, things that she stored away in the attic, that I brought down here with me that I didn't even know what was in them. 


And now I'm getting to a stage where I'm not on the upward. I'm on the very side, the downward side of life now, and having had one heart attack. You don't give me that impression. No, but I am. and as I say having had one heart attack now you never know when the second one might come so I I've just suddenly realized that I'm the one that's got to get these things to the places where they should go and so I started unpacking cards and things are in the most hectic state that you have ever seen and I get so upset because I'm just so I can't work at it very long because it tires me too much and but I am getting things together and so if I ever come over anything across his obituary anything like that that I think you'd be interested in I'd be very bad to let you see it well this I've checked through the star for death announcements and obituaries and copybirds the one Well, 


I know you wouldn't know where it looked. I know that. But I'm possibly that one. I'm sure there is. Yes, I'm sure it is, too. Well, I can get it. I'm certain it's that one. And mother may have that, too. 


Just I'm trying to simplify my own work. Well, I'll tell you. I had a very unfortunate thing happen. My nephew was breaking up in his home one day, one time. And he asked if he could put some of his furniture in my garage. 


So I used the garage for the attic, because I have one of these horrible pull-down things. And they don't like me going up there anyway. So then, after he started housekeeping again, I had to move everything out to the basement. 


And in the middle of all this, while his furniture was still here and everything, I had a flood basin. And so I had to just pick everything up. I lost some of the things that I really am very regretful losing. 


But they were just beyond the water soap that I couldn't do anything about. But those are the cartons and things that I'm going through now and trying to organize and get to the place where they should be. 


Well, actually, you know, any letters from Cherryville? But, you know, like what was happening in any newspaper. And it's important to write up to 1966. to the death of Mrs. Gates. I wish just old material. 


Yes, I know well, I just wish I I just realized now the importance I was telling somebody the other day They were reminiscing about things and I said write those things down because I said when I think Mother and my grandmother told me and my grandfather I said it really makes me ill to think about how I've let history go because I didn't write it down at the time. 


Now, Judy, you're another one, too. And Falls Church is starting a pretty good collection, I think. Oh, they were, uh-huh. This beautiful little collection started in the library. Well, that's what I want to things that I feel it ought to be kept here for Falls Church. 


I want to go to that library while I'm living so I'll know that they're there. I hope you feel the same about it, too. So as I say, the things I have forgotten myself, the other day I was just thinking I couldn't sleep one night and I was just thinking about the things that I have forgotten about the place. 


I think, well, you knew more than this about the place, now what's the matter that you forgot? But I would love to sit down with you someday and have that drawing, but that's what it was about. Well, I think it would be very, very important that, well, I don't know what would be convenient or what your schedule is, but... 


Well, let me see. Next week, I had a Tuesday and Wednesday, I can't do anything. But other than that, I think next week is pretty well open. Well, pick a day next week and tell me what time's convenient and then I'll... 


Well, how about you now? I want you here, too. And what day? Is Thursday all right for you? No Thursday. Is Friday? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We are not that far along at the state of the 15th. 


Well the twenty second would be alright with me. About the same time? run across anything at that time. Well, if I could think of any more, there should be a lot of things that I should remember because, as I said, I spent the first school I ever went to, I went to a theater. 


And I had been to kindergarten and Pennsylvania. First school I came down to was school. I went back to Pennsylvania for one year, and came back here for that. in the next 3rd grade, and I went back Penn State for a degree. 


Then I went to 5th grade to Falls Church, and then I went to City from then on. Well, I know memory is sort of a funny thing. I'm constantly getting into discussions with people and the one fact that I need to make my point. 


I can't remember until I end the discussion. Oh, I see. When I'm driving home, it'll come to me. be like that. I know you can't always just dredge up everything off. Uh, no you can't. Well, uh, I... I was just trying to think of anything more I could do. 


Right at the press. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll come back to that on the 22nd, 1030, and break some graph paper and work on the plan and talk some more about what we're doing. Alright. It's been... 


Left there. The floors in that house were perfectly beautiful. There were whiteboard floors. And my grandmother used to wash those, oil those floors sometimes with just plain kerosene. And then sometimes with milk. 


That's what they are. Milk, yes. But milk. And they were beautiful. Just beautiful. And the wainscoting and everything in that place was pure white. And that pink. My mother went in that house after my uncle re-bought. 


And when she came out of that house, She was so upset. I never saw Mother so upset Mother. She said, I don't know. I don't think I'll ever want to go in that house. That was in 1920? 28, 29. Was there weights coding in the hallway? 


Yes, under the steps. But none on the side walls? No, no on the paper, on the side walls. Is this when the Rosewood Bannister was varnished to? Yes, in the hallway. And I remember this little story. I don't know whether I should tell if you got that. 


I don't know. Well, I don't know. My grandmother's not here now, so I can tell you. I remember we were coming downstairs. My grandma was upstairs with me, and we were coming downstairs, and I started down the stairs. 


Grandma says, well, I'm looking all over the stairs. She was in her same room, and so she just took over the rail, down the rail, and I stood there just spellbound looking at it. I asked my grandmother to go off on the side and break her leg or back or something, but down the stairs she went, and then she got down there and looked at me, and I don't ever get a flat. 


I can see her now. She was so thrilled, and I just stood there in the steps paralyzed. I wouldn't have ridden down that rail for anything. I think I did when I was a child, but I didn't after I was grown. 


And my grandmother in her 70s to do it, but just more than I could take. One other thing I wanted to ask you, and this reminds me of it. of the house toward the city hall, or the chimney is exposed now. 


Was that chimney always exposed, or did the weather board go all the way across at one time? Judy, I don't think that it was exposed. I think the weather board went all the way across. I'm sure it did. 


Yes, that picture is the right one. Well, that picture's the right hand, since it's better than the picture we've got, but it's the wrong end for that. When did the fire take place, anyway, in the Champions' Review? 


Oh, I don't know. I forgot to, I don't remember the letter but this is about too long ago what it's after i moved yes after we moved 30s 40s probably about that time yes it must have been about 30s and that's when the chimney was rebuilt because i know that they had the siding across all the way across and i was looking to see whether this picture might show it but it didn't it has the chimney now this was my grandmother's place in the valley what they call bear garden and No, 


that's, that's grandpa. I'm on this place at Bear Garden and you know, and we've all been, the whole family has been terribly upset about this. Years and years ago, we could have bought that place for $5,000 and we would have all bargained, everything we had almost, and the family bought it in if we'd known that the place was up for sale. 


And it had the most magnificent view. Have you ever been there too early? Judy? I haven't found you. you've got to take me up there someday this winter. I want you to discover we got to see that. And if you look from the front of the house, you looked off towards the Blue Ridge Mountains and at the back of the house you saw the other ganges in the back of the house. 


It was the most beautiful spot. Now, a bare garden. May I see that just a minute? The first one. Jody? Well, that certainly looks like Bear Garden to me. Well, it may be out of state, it may be anything, but it's very much like a dober. 


It may be noble, and I thought it was fair guard. Let's see if it's on the back of the... Oh, she's a pig. May I? Yes, you may. Thank you. Well, maybe he's lost their guard, but they're very much alike, they're very similar to this. 


The first time I was there... there. They had the, the, uh, uh, kitchen. It was an old log cabin. It was on the side. He had to put the other place out near the soldier's home. The sergeant would go to the legal north of the sergeant's house, and this was a go-to. 


And then, it was, uh, uh, at their place in, uh, out, as we called it, Rose Garden. Uh, and soldier's home. My mother met my father, and they were cousins of my father's. So that's a way back in the relationship. 


And that was a cherry? That was a cherry, and, uh, brought. It was a token. It was a good looking. Good looking drone. Here. There he is. We'll get that picture and show you the picture. Well, one of these also looks like... 


the rear of the barn while they're still in the south. A great barber there, which is interesting, but I haven't seen before. I don't think it's a great library. Looks like a big bush or something. And then this one, this one, the penguin's tree. 


Before that block was developed, it's a beautiful photograph, too. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Now who is this? This is Mrs. Morgan. That's Mrs. Morgan and that's her son Jack. And that's Jack and the horse's name is Dick. 


Well I'll say it's Dick cause Dick, I've never known any other horse but Dick. I think they've had other horses. But I think that might be a little, is old Dick. I don't know. Uh, this is painted by Mr. 


Morgan? It's painted, Mr. Morgan. Any idea what they're eating? Oh, well. Wait, I can tell you. Let me see. Mother was born in 69. It must have been painted in the late 70s, because Jack was died when he was young. 


And he and Mother, I think, were about the same age. We were about the same age. So it must have been painted in the late 17th. I think, oh, I adore that picture. Well, they both will be really excellent additions to the report. 


Well, good. I'm glad to die. Oh, beautiful. Well, uh... A home that I'll never forget as long as I live. Well, hopefully it's one that the city won't forget either. Well, that's what I'm worried about, Mr. 


Rand. I am just worried to death about it. Because with this present regime in there, they're not as historically minded and things as the previous one was. Well, I think in the report that we are going to be able to establish in an historical sense and an architectural sense that it's an important house. 


And so, you know, if decisions are made on the basis... Thank you. 

## Historical Context

This 1971 interview with Elizabeth Morgan Styles and her niece Judy Sides provides a rich account of life at Cherry Hill Farm, one of the most historic properties in Falls Church. Elizabeth Morgan Styles grew up at Cherry Hill Farm, which was owned by her grandparents, giving her firsthand knowledge of the property during the early 20th century.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Cherry Hill Name Origin**: The interview suggests that the "Cherry Hill" name derived from the lane of cherry trees and lilacs that led from Broad Street to the house. Styles recounts how her grandmother's cousins first discovered the property while driving from Washington and were so impressed by the beautiful lane in spring bloom that they convinced her grandmother to take them as summer boarders.

2. **Civil War Connections**: The interview provides several references to the Civil War's impact on the property. Styles mentions that her mother found Civil War artifacts, including uniform buttons, while digging in the area known as the "Peach Orchard," which was believed to be the site of the Battle of Peach Orchard. She notes that the peach orchard was located between "Mr. Gage's and the house."

3. **Architectural Evolution**: Styles details changes to the Cherry Hill house over time, explaining how rooms were repurposed and describing specific modifications made to the house in 1928-29 after her grandmother's death. Her description of the "company died" (a small room off the main living room) and the kitchen with its step-up entrance provides insights into the original layout and subsequent renovations.

4. **Outbuildings and Landscape**: The interview mentions several outbuildings, including a barn used for cows and horses, a corn crib, a tool house, a shed, and a chicken house. While Styles doesn't recall a smokehouse or eight-sided summer house mentioned in a previous interview with Mrs. Gage, she provides details about existing structures and their uses.

5. **Horticultural History**: Styles credits her "Uncle Harvey" with creating the rose garden "across the fences" and reveals that the magnolia trees on the property came from seeds collected from the grounds of the Smithsonian. She explains that the land where City Hall now stands was once her uncle's peony field, which he cultivated extensively for commercial purposes.

6. **Supernatural Lore**: The interview includes firsthand accounts of unexplained phenomena at Cherry Hill, including footsteps on the stairs when no one was there and a latch that would lift itself when the family was seated at the dining table. Styles also recounts a personal experience of seeing her deceased great-uncle, Uncle George, at the foot of the stairs.

7. **Climate Reference**: An interesting anecdote about a Christmas with unusually warm weather (windows open and roses blooming in the garden) provides a climatic data point and shows how environmental factors affected residents' experiences.

8. **Landscape Changes**: The interview notes that the pine trees across from the library were planted by Uncle Harvey sometime after 1927, replacing what had been an apple orchard, helping to document the evolution of the landscape.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While this interview focuses primarily on Cherry Hill Farm rather than directly addressing Falls Church naming conventions, it provides valuable context for the Little Falls VA renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Historic Property Context**: Cherry Hill Farm represents one of the oldest and most historically significant properties in Falls Church. Understanding its history helps establish the broader historical context within which the naming and identity of the community developed.

2. **Civil War Reference Point**: The references to the Battle of Peach Orchard and Civil War artifacts found on the property help establish the area's role during the Civil War period, which was a formative time for Falls Church's development. This historical anchor point provides context for understanding how place names evolved during and after this pivotal period.

3. **Agricultural Heritage**: The descriptions of orchards, gardens, and farming activities at Cherry Hill illuminate the agricultural character that defined Falls Church before suburban development. This agricultural heritage forms part of the foundation for understanding the community's historical relationship with its landscape and natural features.

4. **Community Connection to Land**: The interview reveals how deeply residents connected with the landscape and natural features of their properties. This sense of place and the importance of geographical features in defining local identity resonates with the Little Falls renaming initiative's focus on reconnecting with authentic geographical naming.

5. **Family Naming Patterns**: The personal anecdotes about family members and the naming of places within the property (like "company died") demonstrate how informal naming conventions develop based on use and family tradition, which parallels broader community naming practices.

6. **Historical Continuity and Change**: The interview's descriptions of architectural changes, landscape modifications, and property transitions illustrate how places maintain identity through change. This balance between continuity and evolution is central to the renaming initiative's goal of honoring historical connections while addressing contemporary needs.

7. **Local Knowledge Preservation**: The detailed descriptions of property features and historical anecdotes exemplify the importance of preserving local knowledge through oral histories. This preservation of historical memory is an essential component of maintaining authentic community identity through initiatives like the proposed renaming.

The Cherry Hill Farm history, as recounted by Elizabeth Morgan Styles, provides a microcosm of Falls Church's broader historical development, offering insights into how place names emerge from the interplay of landscape features, human activities, and historical events. While not directly addressing the "Little Falls" name, the interview enriches our understanding of how Falls Church residents have historically understood and named their surroundings.

## Transcript

Here we go. Grandmother's house. Yeah. When was this house built? I did. My grandmother's house. I don't know when that house was built. Who built it? Did your grandmother build it? Yeah. Well, now, you know, I don't even know that, to tell you the truth. 


I don't know that. I don't know. They came out here. Let's see. He built this house. I don't really know. After all, they came out here. Certainly, after Annie was born, about 1890 or so. She's going to Washington, I guess. 


Oh, is she? No, maybe she's going to Pittsburgh. She might have been going to Pittsburgh, by the way. Now, Vaudevant, excuse me. I really don't know when they came to Falls Church. No, I didn't. Well, it was somewhere in the first decade. 


Before 1910. Oh, certainly. After the Spanish-American War. Oh, certainly. It was, I would guess, I would assume it was very much after the 1900s. It certainly had to be soon after the 1900s. Even he was living out here before he married, wasn't he? 


Not living here. Not actually living out here. No. I mean, he spent a lot of time out here. Time out here, but he lived in Washington. He stayed at Mrs. Holland's. He used to stay up on 11th Street out of Mrs. 


Holland's house when he was caught in my mother back there earlier. Who built the store? Annie built the store. No, well. No, no, not the first store. The first store. The first store. My grandmother built that store. 


I would guess she built that store, you know, like in the 20s. About in the 20s, that store was built. When I was probably a very little young, youngster, when that store was built. Was it just a general store? 


It's a general store. Just a general grocery store, right. Yeah. Did she run it? She ran it. She ran it. She ran it. And it was the main, you know, you know, clerk and everything else. My grandfather kind of did the jobs around, but mainly my grandfather carried groceries up on the hill. 


He would carry groceries up to the people on the hill here. And of course, up on the hill, you know, by the Baptist Church and all up here. And what was his name? His name was William. William A. William A. 


William A. William A. Yeah. Of course he had come, you know, from Vicksburg. That's where he was born. And he was the one who, no, Vicksburg, Mississippi. He had been first, his name wasn't Henderson. 


His name was Roddegies, according to Ian Stettner. No, it wasn't Rodriguez. No, it isn't. It is not Rodriguez. It's something like R-O-D-I-G-U-I-Z. It's not Rodriguez. It's R-I-D-O-G-U-R, like Riddegies, something like that. 


Similar name. Similar name, but not. His father had been a Riddegies. Well, how did his name get to be Henderson? They changed it. This plane changed it. Just decided to change the Henderson, that's all. 


This plane changed it. After he came up here? No, no, before he came up here, in Mississippi. And he was born in Vicksburg as William Riddegies, but when he came up here, and I think before that, they took on the name, and I think his father did even here to him, took on the name of Henderson. 


I don't even know what, I can't tell you, probably it says in Steadman's book, what year he came up here, but of course when he came here, and I can't really tell you when he met Louisa Mars, his wife, but I would assume they must have met in Washington. 


I'm sure that's right, because yes, my grandmother came to Washington with her sister, Alice Chiu. Alice, no, with Alice here, Alice, but there was Alice Mars, and Meredith Chiu, and they came to Washington, and somehow my grandfather came, even to work on the railroads or something like that, and met my grandmother in 1882. 


1883, got married like February or January of 1882, and my father was, 1883, and my father was born nine months later, in November. Do you remember the little police station here? Oh, a certain amount of the police station, and Mr. 


Thomas' shoe store right next to it, and this was- Was this the point building, or was that- No, no, that white building was where the Robinsons lived. I used to get my hair cut there. Robinsons? Robinsons, and then they moved, and they still have relatives. 


His son, or daughter-in-law, still lives up on Cypriot Street, but that's where the first people I knew who lived there were the Robinsons, and I used to get my hair cut there. And what was the third building on the other side of the street? 


Well, that was Mr. Thomas' shoe shop. You mean, he had a shoe shop there after he got off the corner? Oh, yeah, but when I knew him, he had the little shoe shop right, that little building in between the police station and the- I forget who lived in there.

This, this house had to be, this house had to be across, let's see, where's the graveyard? Beginner begins there? Yeah, it begins there, doesn't it? My, my grandmother's store was right on there. It was right next to the fence. 


My grandmother's store was there. Right across from her was the house I'm talking about that was here. Walter's lived back, you know, some distance back, which would have to be, if it's in this picture, what is that supposed to be right there? 


What is it? It looks like, like a chair or a barn, doesn't it? No, this is a barn here. It's a barn. But that's not a house either. It looks more like a barn, doesn't it? Yeah, the house that he lived in had to be back off. 


But there was a house way back here, you know, close to what's now Maple Avenue. Yeah, maybe that's the road right there. It came back here, and he's right about there. Well, I don't think it was back that far.

That's after World War two 1960 Well, as you were hanging on to some old cars, 1960, when did Andy Biller steal us? I think so. You got some pictures here. Look at the 1949 picture. Let me see it. I hear it shows some of the stars right here. 


Yeah, but let me see your 1949 era photo. But, yes, it was right next to that driveway. It was here on West Fairfax. Yeah, right. Yeah, we had a big hedge in between the two. That's Swift. Yeah, those were the Swifts. 


Swift shows on Port Picture C-2239, dated July 1946. Just to the north of the 307 South Maple. Palm Swift, Judy Swift. I can't remember the old man, I can't remember, I remember Tom and Judy and they had two daughters and maybe two sons, I can't remember now. 


They remind you of the family that we look at the Waltons. As a matter of fact, they kind of remind me of the Waltons because I remember two generations in the old family. Were they white people? Yeah, they were white. 


Oh yeah, we, we, we, that's the point. We played just like we didn't know the difference. That's true. Yeah, we just didn't know the difference. At that time, it looks like they were just building, weren't they? 


Yes. In, in Ms. Gundry, somebody had bought Ms. Gundry's property by then and they were putting up the apartments. This is by when? 48 that they did that. Oh yeah, these are all, I can see, yes, they've got, I came to Falls Church in 1947. 


Now this house was still on the hill, isn't that something? This house there, you see the bowling alley was not there. That house is where I used to go up there, the windmill up there. Who in the world lived up there? 


I shouldn't know. Oh, you mean right behind the heckengers? Yeah, up on the hill. That's all that was up there was a big house. Big old frame house. That's right, it had a windmill, first windmill ever saw. 


And I, first time I ever saw how you could attach a windmill to a pump and, and pump water. Wasn't there a house that was closer to heckengers? I can go right down below here. Oh, the Brents. Now the Brents lived, the Brent house. 


They're closer now. The Brents house is, let's see now if I can locate too many trees in here to see much. Well okay, our house is here. There's the Brents house right there. Right where the heckinger's corner is. 


They sold the heckinger, I guess, the Brent house right there. Right there at the corner of whatever, well the street is there now. It's the street over, second over from this one. It was right on the corner, that wasn't on the corner, it was back off the street. 


It was halfway between Lee Highway and, and Maple off of that street that runs on the other side you know this park I'm in this shopping up here second Street over and it was situated halfway between Lee Highway and Maple Avenue the Brents and then Heckerd of course bought and took up all the space. 


Looks like Heckerd is here. Was it already on here? Right there I think. Well look there is this building here. There is a building here. Kind of a longish building? Yeah. Yeah that's a long. But the thing you're looking at is not, no that's the, that's the. 


Of course if you go ahead. You mean Lee Highway? No. You know when you go from here and go towards what we call the farm and you get up on the top most part after you're at the edge of whole church. I guess so. 


Is that the sign there? And then you start going down. Yeah. And you remember there's that shopping centers at A and B. Well the topmost hill and they built houses up on the side of the hill. That's horseshoe hill. 


Horseshoe hill goes around in that kind of a direction. It actually forms a horseshoe like You mean the shape of the shape of the hill. Yeah In other words the highway goes right on through part of that hill As it makes a horseshoe, I guess around I think it probably goes around probably goes around like I guess it goes around probably like this You think the highway cuts through the highway cuts through about the middle of it. 


I suspect I think that's probably right Yeah, because when you get down on Andale Road, there's no more hill, you know, the hill ends up on 150 Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, right, but I'm saying if you were to go back back that would be South The hill runs out over there By or by before you get to right 50 right back over by there Well, yeah, that's 50. 


Yeah, that's good. Yeah, but that's what we call horseshoe hill and we always When we used to go to the farm You know, we used to always say we have to go up by horseshoe hill to get to the farm Which was a mile and a quarter from here. 


Do you remember anything about the birch britches Frank birch? Just knew the britches. I can't remember anything about the birth. Well, not telling you Where the National Memorial Cemetery then, you know during well during the Spangburg War, it was the place Where the soldiers bivouac it was their hospital. 


It was Camp Alger camp. Oh, yeah, well, they brought them back Camp Alger was spread over a lot of ground and they had their headquarters in Well right near Dunlory house still stays that's how they use it Dunlory. 


Yeah. Yeah, it's you know or how school is. You go out on Lee Highway to Gells Road and turn right on Gells Road. And about, oh, less than a mile if I was recording a mile. There's a school house on the left. 


And right behind that school house was this headquarters. But now, if you're going out from Falls Church to the farm, you went out Lee Highway. And then was the farm on the right. Right across from Graham. 


Dr. Graham at his house. Right where? Big frame house. Yeah, big frame house. On the top of that hill. On the left. On the left. That was Graham. And Graham owned, Graham owned the first part. He owned the property right next to that road. 


We didn't own that. That was owned, at least we had it. He owned the property that was on Lee Highway. Was his property all on the left side of the road? No, he had, as I say, if you were on, here's Graham Road. 


is Lee Highway and you're going on up here and I guess this road over there, yeah. Graham had his house here. You went up here and you went into the farm off the road here. Oh, wait a minute, no, it's just... 


Here's where you're at. And it's Safeway. Safeway is here. Yeah. Well this would be West Street. That's West Street. Yeah. That's West Street. Isn't that how you got the farm, by going up West Street? 


Yeah, we went up West Street, right. Into the sort of what's back entrance to the cemetery. No, there was a dirt road right here. Yeah. There was another dirt road right here. And the back entrance is way down here. 


The back entrance is way down here. So Graham owned about all this, Dr. Graham owned all this property over here. Yeah, before we got to our place, our farm ran here. Oh, you were, but he was, I mean, you were behind Dr. 


Graham. Or on this. From the highway. This would be the north side of the highway, right, going toward Fairfax, actually. And his house was here. Yeah. And we started some, I don't know, you know, 300 feet or so after you left here and there was a big cherry tree right here. 


That's where, that was the marker, I guess, was that cherry tree right there. Still there, I guess. I don't know. It may be. I don't know. Then we would go in and the old house, the big house that went with the camp was right here. 


Went with the camp? It went with, you know, Camp Alton. It went with the old. It was a big house that they used. Well, yeah. That also then, down here below there, I guess that was the big place for either the, because it was always a big concrete wall down below the hill. 


There was always a big concrete wall down here. I never saw, I have to assume that maybe there had been one time either barracks or stables. I don't know which. You mean right next to the house? No, down the hill from there. 


Oh, down the... Yeah, here was the house. And the biggest thing this, now this is still here, there's a huge, beautiful element. tree with absolutely wonderful branches and this was where the pump was. 


The pump was right there. I remember that clearly. Where is the pump? Where is it? And the house was kind of up the hill from there. What was Mr. Norman's first name? Colonel Norman? Yeah. Colonel Norman? 


I don't even know. Colonel Norman's first name? You all bought the place from him. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. How big was the pond? How big was the pond? 67 acres. Exactly. Over six to seven and a half acres. 


Always had to sign with no time to sell. Had the farmhouse been built by Colonel Norman? I don't know. It was a huge. house. I don't know. You have no idea of when it was going to be on the 8th. No, I don't know. 


When did it disappear? When they showed it to the National Superior Cemetery. They demolished it. Yeah. It was in. did you sell it did your family sell it to the cemetery my the people who owned it it was owned by three people Kato Adams my father four people Kato Adams Sam Compton my father and assistant superintendent Wilkerson got Garnet Wilkerson Garnet Garnet Wilkerson who was the assistant superintendent of schools in Washington DC and who was the other man Sam Compton was a teacher at Armstrong High School I guess he taught mathematics and Kato and my father they they're the ones who went into the venture lost their shirts oh really yes sounds like chicken George's money somebody came up with a some kind of a deal or bargain with them and they were always in trouble I think I think this like chicken George I think my father borrowed money from my mother to buy it and then of course I guess it was it was forced with foreclosure when they had to sell it they always said they were doing you know you're talking about the person came along soon after they probably bought it in the I guess the 20s probably in the early 20s because I remember it as early as I can remember anything going out and going up on the buggy and on the wagon and picking apples and this is I can remember the earth so they had to be in the 20s they sold it probably in the depression years in the like the 30s I think probably they probably sold in the middle to late 30s I think before I left you in 39 I'm sure they'd sold it by then so your life with all the church who was spent either here in this house or out at the farm mostly well it was spent here but we go up to the farm Sam Compton lived in it all the time Sam lived in it most of the time it was his house to live in that he's gone the ropes that would come out sometimes in the summer him and his wife but Sam lived in there until he moved the halls most of the time. 


And then it, I guess then it, I remember it was abandoned though after that. I don't remember really in the last years that anybody was living there, as I recall it. I don't really think so. Did you enjoy it out there? 


Oh yeah. What did you do? Were you just a boy then? Oh yeah. Was that fun? Oh yeah. I was, as I say, I, this was in the, in the late 20s particularly, in the early 30s, I don't remember that we did much up there. 


As I say, I suspect that they sold it in the middle 30s or so. I think they sold it before I left here. I think they did. But I used to go up and I remember I was doing a number of things. I remember we had three used cherry trees, or four. 


Yeah, two on the highway and two back. And of course holly, I remember we had some beautiful holly trees, which we used to get holly and I used to make wreaths. things like that I remember we have mostly apples though most of it of the sixty seven acres I guess half of it was probably an apple or I would suspect Yeah, and some of it was open land which was father would go up and farm with friends and John who lived with us here, 


and whoever else. And at times I remember he'd have to do his night because he would come home from, you know, work in Washington and had to go up and get, get a lady, that was the name of our horse, Lighty. 


Take a lady up there and attach it to her on a plow at night. That's the only time we could do it. Lighty got killed right out here. I remember. Always when I thought that was a terrible name. I never could understand why a lady, my father bought Lighty from, I don't know, some, you know, good buyer, a seller, and it had to be in the, was she a workhorse or a? 


Well it had recently been a riding horse, you know, not a, it had been a riding horse. I don't remember that we had more than two horses, I can remember. Lighty was one, we had another, but the thing that happened with Lighty was the highway it comes with you, as I say, about. 


Thank you. 

## Historical Context

This interview with James Henderson provides valuable insights into the history of the Henderson family, one of the prominent African American families in Falls Church during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Henderson Family Origins**: The interview reveals that James Henderson's grandfather originally had the surname "Riddegies" (or similar spelling, not Rodriguez) and was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The family changed their name to Henderson before moving north. This name change reflects the common practice among formerly enslaved people to adopt new surnames after emancipation.

2. **Family Business**: The Henderson family operated a grocery store near the intersection of Fairfax Street and South Washington Street in Falls Church, which served as an important business in the Black community. James Henderson notes that his grandmother built the store "in the 20s" and ran it herself, while his grandfather "carried groceries up on the hill" to customers.

3. **Community Layout**: Henderson provides detailed information about the layout of Falls Church in the early 20th century, particularly the area around what is now the intersection of Fairfax Street and South Washington Street. He references several landmarks including the church, the police station, Thomas' shoe shop, and various residences, helping to reconstruct the physical geography of historic Falls Church.

4. **Business District**: The interview details several businesses that formed the commercial core of Falls Church, including Henderson's grocery store, Brown's hardware store (which also sold groceries), Abbott's grocery store (which later became Dawkins and then an EGS store), and Sam Poho's grain and feed store on the southeast corner of Broad Street.

5. **Social Geography**: Henderson's descriptions reveal the social geography of Falls Church, particularly how the Black community was centered around specific neighborhoods, including "up on the hill," which likely refers to the area near the Baptist Church.

6. **Timeline of Development**: The interview suggests that Henderson's grandmother's store was built in the 1920s, providing a timeline for the development of Black-owned businesses in Falls Church. References to specific changes in the layout of buildings and streets over time help establish a chronology of the community's development.

7. **Infrastructure Changes**: Henderson discusses changes to the landscape, including the transformation of Broad Street, which once had large maple trees that were later removed. He also references the construction of newer buildings and developments like the bowling alley.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While the Henderson interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides valuable context for the renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Community Heritage**: The interview documents the contributions of the Henderson family to Falls Church's development, highlighting the diversity of the community's historical narrative. A complete understanding of Falls Church's history must include perspectives from all community members, including African American residents whose stories have often been underrepresented.

2. **Historical Accuracy**: Any renaming initiative should be based on a comprehensive understanding of the area's history. The Henderson interview helps fill gaps in the historical record, particularly regarding the Black experience in Falls Church during the early 20th century.

3. **Geographical References**: Henderson's detailed descriptions of locations and landmarks provide insights into how residents understood and navigated the geography of Falls Church before modern development changed the landscape. This helps establish the historical context for how place names evolved and were used by different community members.

4. **Timeline of Development**: Henderson's recollections about when certain changes occurred in Falls Church help establish a timeline that can inform the renaming initiative, showing how the community developed and how its identity evolved over time.

5. **Inclusive History**: The Little Falls renaming initiative aims to reconnect the community with its authentic historical identity. Including perspectives from historically marginalized communities, such as those represented in the Henderson interview, ensures that this reconnection honors the full breadth of the area's history rather than a selective version.

Henderson's family history of changing their name from "Riddegies" to Henderson also offers an interesting parallel to the community's consideration of a name change, suggesting that names and identity can evolve while maintaining historical continuity and authenticity.

Yeah. Yeah. Two dozen houses. What were some of them to remember? Well, I delivered milk to a half dozen of them. What were some of those? Well, doctors and there's a format that was on the corner. Corner of what? 


Underwood and B Highway. Uh huh. And the Hodgson family was the other corner. Hodgson, yeah. I know Tom Hodgson. I know Tom Hodgson. Come see him. Come see him. He was at Williams County. Uh, some more names. 


There was a children that moved away. And, of course, the Scott Ryer and the whole Henry Ryer. Did you know Henry Ryer? I delivered milk there. Did you know him? Well, I know him when I saw him. But you didn't really know him very well. 


I never would. No. Did you know the Kinsleys? It's a really sad Oh, yeah, sure. They were nice people. They lived right in there. They lived on the east, the south side of the island. You're right. Right outside Hudson. 


Right where the telephone company's building is. No, not quite. Right next to it. Next to it. It's apartments right now. I don't know. And I knew the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the Eastman's and the Osher. 


Fenricks? Fenricks and Eastman's. They were, you know, I went to school, went straight through all the schools. About what period are you thinking about right now? Well, I, I guess that would be 19, uh, between 1912 and 1918. 


During the World War I period? Yeah, yeah. I was in eighth grade during World War I in Georgetown. They didn't have a high school in Falls Church, so we had to go find one someplace else. Where'd you go to grade school? 


The old, uh, what do you call it, Jefferson Institute? Jefferson School? The Jefferson Institute? Jefferson Institute? Yeah. Soap Factory? Soap Factory, yeah. When you finished there, you went to high school in the distance? 


Well, no, I had to go to eighth grade in Georgetown in order to get transferred into the high school without problems. So I went to a high school, a grade school on T, Q Street, about 33rd Q. There was three schools in one city block there. 


I can remember one of them, but I can't remember the name of the school I went to. It was right in the middle of Georgetown. Yeah, that's right. So then I went over to Tech High School and I got to get there. 


I wanted to go to Western High School because you couldn't get in there with all the rest of the kids from Falls Church and Cherrydale, wherever they were, went to Western because they could walk from the end of the street car to school. 


Yeah, I had to take three street cars to get to. And you couldn't get in because it was, the line had been too long? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I didn't. There were too many who wanted to get in. There were too many from Virginia that went to Western. 


My older sister had to go to Central, which was down on 7th and P Street, and I went on up 7th Street to Rhode Island Avenue and He died in July, and you were born in December of 1900. But your father lived. 


Father died when he was 79 years old, in 1942. Oh, you knew him a long time ago, for 42 years. No, no, of course not. Yeah, 42 years, 1942. Was he the main operator of the farm there? Oh, yes. Yes. And then following his death, what did he do? 


Ran the farm for about 10 years. Which room is that now? Well, my brother. Your brother? Yeah. Your brother ran the farm. And then Youngville took it over. No. When he got out of the Army, he bought a place east of her. 


And then Terry Farm ran it. Where's your, where's the, he'll run the Terry Farm in East Falls, pretty well. Well, I don't think he ran it. When he was a, when he was holding out for you, he went on to the Army and went overseas. 


And it was in the war. And that would be Youngville. When he got out of the Army, he came back and lived there for a little while. Maybe I don't think it was a year until he and William, my brother, could find a farm for him to operate on his own. 


And that was the one out in Herndon. That's right. In disposing of the milk and the dairy, did you? Did you carry someone into the district? Oh, yes. We had to haul it with a wagon and a horse and a horse-drawn vehicle. 


Of course, there was no automobiles. This goes back in time, how far? Well, I would guess that the rain was to pick it up. It must have been somewhere around 1915 or something. You mean when the first general pickup came in? 


Well, it wasn't hard. I think it was when the trucks became available. And I don't know when that was. That would be in the teens. I reckon. World War I. Because I could ride my bike from Underwood to a wagon with colored cars. 


and it was ten or twelve cows. What's the crossroads of? Gleeb Road. Gleeb Road. Down Gleeb Road, across Chain Bridge, down Canal Road, without any problem. Where was the slaughterhouse? That I never, I can't remember, but I know, I have somewhere in Georgetown. 


Must have been because I distinctly remember going across Chain Bridge with them. And I distinctly remember sitting on the seat of this old wagon with a couple of guys chasing the cows back in the road, a couple of times they went through the woods and they scared a little bit. 


Isn't that hard to believe? You can sit on the highway now and picture that. No cows there anymore. Sure, pretty cat. A lot of people used to come with their buckets. Oh yeah, yeah they did. I would guess ten or fifteen near neighbors would bring buckets and you'd dip them out milk out of a ten gallon can at the bottom of the cooler, ten cents a quart. 


And then I had my little route when I was maybe ten or twelve years old and I charged them two cents I think it was to deliver. I had to collect the bill. You remember Forrest Howard? Oh yeah, he and I were kind of friends, a little bitty fella. 


Yeah, I talked to him recently. He and I, this could go on all night because I get to talk and I can't quit. Had to bring the threshing machine. machine in from Loudon, I guess. We were the last one, the farthest east. 


There was one more farm, down close to the Washington, and the boy that helped with him in the cemetery, the man. Greaves? Greaves. That was the last dairy farm. Ours was the next to the last dairy farm. 


In order to get your grains thrashed, you had to wait until the guy came down from Loudon. Well, Forrest and I were throwing the bundles up on the wagon, and William was up on the wagon. All of them got along where the thrashing machine was. 


I'd lift off the two top cabs. Forrest would reach in, grab the snake, and snap his tongue out. It was kind of a cool day, and they were getting up in the shocks. We had individual shocks. You're all right. 


The lights just went off. My recollection is he got twenty-two snakes. Out of what? Where was the snake? Wheat. Oh, it was wheat shops. Wheat shops. Oh, I see. Two cap bundles on top of the shop. Yeah. 


It was a snake in many of them. What kind of snakes? Black snakes or...? I don't know what they were. Copperheads or...? No, no, there wasn't any bad snakes. Boy, boy, there wasn't snakes. Black snakes and what we used to call first and last snakes, the stripers ones. 


First and last. The coin snakes. But then the turtles moved in and the snakes disappeared. Land turtles. Yeah. Came in, lots of them. And we never had any more problems with snakes. This was just a natural happening. 


Must have been. What did the turtles do for the snakes? I ate the eggs. Oh, I suppose so, yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Who was living in the big house on North Washington Street, as you recollect? Clark and Betty. 


His wife? And Aunt Pansy. Pansy, Payne. Yeah. Cross-cross. Yeah. As far back as you remember, they were living there. Yeah. And Sue lived there for a while, so she built her own house to live in. Where did Sue build her house? 


She built it on the 25th Street, about what we used to call Cedar Street. Oh, there in that block between Underwood and Washington Boulevard? Yeah. On the west side. On the west side. On the west side or west side, whatever. 


The west side. West side toward Loudon. Yeah. It was about the third house. Third house on Underwood? Yeah. Is that where she died? She built another stone house just off of Washington, about a block further west, and I'll be doing it for her. 


That's where she died, certainly that's where she died. I don't believe she ever lived in that stone house. Yes? She was a really bad guy. Uh-huh. Let me ask you about, there, you know where, where's drugstore was later on? 


Well, that was down there at the, uh, the depot. Yeah. It was in the depot. Yeah, well, if, uh, if this is where's drugstore, right here, this thing. Yeah. And here's Lee Highway. Yeah. And here's a building across this road. 


That was actually, uh, to have a tennis over it, I didn't know it was the second floor or not, but... Well, now wait a minute, now wait a minute, originally, back at the, oh there was a two-story house that burned down. 


When did it burn? I was there when it was still smoke, smoking, and it was a printing place where the printer was. There was a print shop there? A print shop, yeah. I don't know what else was in there, and it burned down and Sue rebuilt it into a one-story building. 


Yeah, and that's where the shops and where the restaurant was later, and where Boyd's shoes were. Well, I remember one time I took her over to the cemetery on Memorial Day and she wanted to drive down the alley behind the building to see how they would take a share of things back there. 


Well, it was Gibson's little sort of fountain in their new building, in the second building there. I think so. I believe so. Bunny. Bunny Gibson. Yeah. Well, can you pick out an approximate year when it burned, 1912? 


I imagine I was 12 years old, I guess, pretty close to that. Eleanor Fenwick wasn't sure what she thought it would burn sometime before 1912. Maybe so. Well, she and I are the same age. We went to school together, and in fact, I had a crush on her. 


I thought she was the prettiest girl ever, so I'm a little... No, I think you're a Virginia fella. Oh, you're a Virginia fella? Yeah, Charlie's wife. No, Harriet, Harriet, wait a minute, we're getting your fellows, your fellows here, it's just, you know, you're the prettiest thing in the world. 


You're the prettier girl you thought was the prettiest thing in the world. Yes, right. And she married Charlie Fender, and Eleanor Eastman, I swear to you. Eleanor Eastman married Charlie Fender. All right. 


And then Virginia followed her, married Edward Fender. Edwin or Edgar? Edward. Edward Fender. You didn't call him your everything. Yes, right. Did that leave you devastated? I don't know. Was your wife from Paul's? 


No, she was from... I met her where I worked there in the Chicago area. She was from San Luis. Do you remember Pickering Dodge? Lived in a big house on the 25th Street down next to Washington Boulevard? 


I know the building. There was a cross from Nurse's House. Nurse's House and then the girl across the street. Eleanor, what was the name of her? Phil Nurse's niece that I used to chase around with. Phil Nurse's niece. 


Her name was Kinsley. Kinsley? Anyway, her girlfriend was right across the street and this fella, I think he had a wooden leg. That's Pickering Dodge. I've seen him with a wooden leg because I delivered newspapers for a little while later. 


And he's the one who took most of the pictures for Charles Stewart's little book, Virginia Village, that was published in about 1904. You never saw that book? Maybe I did, I don't know. Oh, no, I've got the full picture. 


Yeah, Virginia Village had the picture of your house just after the plan of the trees in the front yard. Yeah, it does have a picture of your house. Yeah, I remember. We had that little book at home. 


I reckon my kid's sister got the book. Sister? Louis Shaw. Louis Shaw, where'd she live? Down in Florida. Florida? Do you have any other sisters? I have an older sister, Florence. She married Romine Taylor from Dunlory. 


And she's by the way. But Dr. Frank was Romine a few days ago. I hope I don't end up that way. You remember East Falls Church more than you do Falls Church itself, I suppose. Well, the only thing I knew about Falls Church was a drugstore up there where you could buy schools. 


And then, of course, school supplies? Yeah, a candy store, a drugstore, but you know why it was the mankins. Mankins, yeah. On the corner. Well, it might have been on the corner, but I think it was up about one. 


Yeah, one drilling back from the corner. That's where Dr. Ware later had his... That's right. That's where it went down. Then of course, then there was a... Well, in East Falls Church, there was the Elditz general's building. 


Yeah. Which was Snyder's hardware later. And Elliot had a store over across Lee Highway. I remember Mitchell's barbershop. Remember the old Joe Mitchell. What about Joe Mitchell? He had that little old barbershop there all his life I guess. 


Right in the building next to the railroad track. Yeah. On the south side. Yeah. But the building next to the track. Yeah. But there wasn't any building between him and the track. That used to be one of the railroad stations. 


No. That was the railroad station. They moved it across the highway. And they hold a late 1890s. Yeah. The first railroad station they moved back and became Morton's Pet Shop among other things. And then the second one they moved across Lee Highway. 


The young man was two boys. The younger boy and I went to school together. Cecil and Russell. Russell, yeah. I was born in Russell. Whatever. He died. He lived in Ash Grove when he died. Do you remember Ash Grove near Tysons Corner? 


Yeah. I was in there when there was a girl there. There was a friend of my sister Louise. Louise and the part that lived in Ash Grove were buddy buddies. I don't remember what her last name was. I didn't know the beans were there. 


The beans lived in in that building for six or eight years. Part of it lived next door to us would be interesting maybe. You'd know Burns, Sunshine, Teenie, Buddy, and Betty. Burns? Burns. Gibson Burns? 


I never knew what to do. Oh, not a Burns family, not a Gibson. Burns family. Burns family. They live next door. On Underwood Street? Yeah. And the two girls married, the two boys, George McBoys. Oh, right. 


Do you remember Sharp Vandermark? Oh, sure. He was on the farm. He's double in the farm. What about you? Well, I'll tell you, Edward Vandermark and I were the same age when I schooled together. So he quit a great school there at Jefferson Institute because he couldn't get along with the teachers. 


And he went on to Catholic school. And I used to visit up there overnight. Thank you. Well, I guess it's about where Mill Park, uh, places on, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, 


uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I knew where the cemetery was now. 


I crushed the cemetery. Do you remember that? Oh, yeah. I remember the farm because we had our thank you and dinner there about every two or four years. They relocated. Christmas was actually a dinner. 


And Franklin was back in town from there. Yeah, that's right. Back on the issue. I don't know. Had the Crossman, any of the Crossman's ever been on what was Frank Burch's farm? To live there? Yeah. No. 


It seems to me that one of the maps of about 1978 showed a Crossman farm out there, too. A Crossman's name. No, I don't know about that. Who was there before Frank went out there? I don't know. I was just a little kid when we started going out there. 


Yeah. We still have an old, part of an old milk can. Five-gallon, ten-gallon milk can that Frank used when he was up in the dairy. He had kind of a truck farm. I was there one day visiting Milton. And I, I, anyway, they had sent a wagon load. 


One of them, Frank had taken a wagon load of boxes of tomatoes to the market. I don't know where to mark it. Probably old Central Market, Center Market. They brought them all back. Thank you. 

## Historical Context

George Isaac Crossman (1900-1991) was the grandson of Isaac Crossman, who was one of the earliest settlers to arrive in Falls Church after the Civil War. The Crossman family became one of the most prominent families in the area, operating a significant dairy farm in East Falls Church. This interview provides important firsthand accounts of daily life in Falls Church during the early 20th century, particularly from 1900-1918.

The interview captures vital details about:

1. The Crossman family genealogy and settlement patterns in Falls Church
2. Agricultural practices, particularly dairy farming operations
3. Transportation networks, including the use of horse-drawn wagons to transport milk to Georgetown
4. Educational systems, including the Jefferson Institute and schools in Georgetown and Washington DC
5. The rural character of Falls Church during the early 20th century
6. Local businesses and community relations

George Crossman's memories of driving cattle from East Falls Church to Georgetown provide particularly valuable insights into the interconnected nature of the Washington metropolitan area before widespread automobile use, when the landscape was still largely rural and agricultural.

Additional significant historical insights from this interview include:

1. **Early Falls Church Education System**: The Jefferson Institute (also called "Soap Factory") served as the primary school for Falls Church children, but the lack of a local high school forced students to travel to Washington D.C. for secondary education. Crossman describes having to attend eighth grade in Georgetown to facilitate his transfer to Tech High School. This reveals the educational limitations in early 20th century Falls Church and the community's reliance on Washington D.C.'s school system.

2. **Commercial Development**: The interview references several early businesses in East Falls Church, including:
   - Where's Drugstore, located at the depot
   - A printing shop that burned down around 1912 and was rebuilt by "Sue" (presumably Sue Crossman) into a one-story building
   - The Elditz general store (later Snyder's hardware)
   - Mitchell's barbershop adjacent to the railroad tracks
   - Mankins drugstore in Falls Church proper

3. **Transportation Infrastructure**: Crossman mentions the railroad stations in East Falls Church, noting that the first station was moved and repurposed as Morton's Pet Shop, while a second one was relocated across Lee Highway in the late 1890s. This shifting of transportation infrastructure illustrates early development patterns.

4. **Architectural History**: References to specific homes and buildings provide insights into the built environment of early 20th century Falls Church, including the "big house on North Washington Street" where Clark, Betty, and Aunt Pansy lived, and the stone house built by Sue Crossman.

5. **Social Networks**: The interview reveals the close-knit nature of the Falls Church community through Crossman's recollections of neighbors, schoolmates, and social connections. He mentions numerous local families including the Hodgsons, Ryers, Kinsleys, Eastmans, Fenricks, Fenders, and Vandermarks, demonstrating the interconnected social fabric of early Falls Church.

6. **Photographic Documentation**: Crossman mentions Pickering Dodge, who photographed Falls Church for Charles Stewart's book "Virginia Village" (published circa 1904), which included images of the Crossman family home. This reference points to early efforts to document Falls Church visually.

7. **Agricultural Practices**: Detailed descriptions of dairy farming, threshing wheat, and managing local wildlife (snakes and turtles) provide insights into the agricultural methods and challenges in early 20th century Falls Church. The story about finding 22 snakes in wheat shocks illustrates the rural realities of the time.

8. **Local Commerce**: The interview describes the practice of selling milk directly to neighbors (at ten cents a quart), with Crossman earning two cents per delivery as a child. This reflects the informal economic systems that existed before modern retail infrastructure.

These insights collectively portray Falls Church during a transitional period when it maintained strong agricultural roots while beginning to develop more complex commercial and residential characteristics. The interview captures the community before major suburban development transformed the area.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This oral history interview offers several important connections to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Historical Land Usage**: The interview documents the agricultural character of East Falls Church in the early 20th century, demonstrating how the area maintained its rural character well into the 1900s, with dairy farming being a prominent economic activity.

2. **Regional Connections**: Crossman's recollections of driving cattle from Falls Church to Georgetown via Chain Bridge and along Canal Road demonstrate the historical connections between Little Falls of the Potomac and Falls Church. This describes a geographical relationship that supports the historical connection between the two place names.

3. **Community Development**: The interview reveals information about early development patterns, family connections, and community formation in Falls Church, providing context for how the community has evolved over time.

4. **Naming Evolution**: Through references to various locations and landmarks, the interview indirectly documents the way residents understood and referred to different areas, contributing to our understanding of local place names and their usage.

5. **Transportation Routes**: The mention of Gleeb Road, Chain Bridge, and Canal Road provides information about historical transportation networks that connected Falls Church to the Little Falls area of the Potomac, reinforcing the geographical relationship between these locations.

The Crossman family history serves as an important link in understanding the development of Falls Church from a rural agricultural area to the modern community it is today, supporting the historical basis for reconnecting with earlier geographical naming conventions.

About 19... Just before the Depression. Do you remember the Depression? Yes, I do. I was living in Washington. I had moved out and we come from Leesburg to Washington in 25. We moved out here in Virginia in 27. 


We were living in Washington when that happened. No, it wasn't. We were living out here. I was living out here when that happened. That happened about 1932, wasn't it? Twenty-nine. That's when my oldest son was born. 


He was born in 1928. Did you have any tough times during the Depression? No, I sure did. I got along just fine, thank you, Lord. My father and mother lived in those Macarenes on the farm. But I can't remember whose farm they lived on. 


But at that time, they were living on the farm. They had pictures in the garden and everything in the farm. They were funny to me. My daddy worked on the farm. At that time, no, I got along just fine. 


I didn't have nothing to make or lose. I didn't have nothing to lose. I didn't have to worry about anything. That's wonderful. That's right. It's like Mandy Ellison. Do you ever hear of Mandy Ellison? 


Yes, indeed. Mr. Shree was telling me the other day that she could go right over to the streetcar line. She never missed a streetcar. Because she just took the first one that came along after she got there. 


Mandy Ellison was the first cousin to my daddy, Will Jones. Mandy Ellison? Yes, sir. Mandy Ellison was the first cousin to my daddy. This is Mandy Ellison lived there at the corner of Broad and West. 


Broad and West. You know where the... Oh, that's somebody else, yeah. Oh, that's the Ellison. I know who you're talking about. That was Wright. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about, yeah. 


So this was Mandy Ellison lived down there like he was caught. I thought you were talking about her. But you're talking about the Ellison that used to live on the... Broad Street. That's right. I don't remember none of them. 


You don't remember any of them? No, I don't. Hmm. Did you used to use the collie? Oh, Lord, I used to ride all the rails up and down the... and I'm a little street car ride car that goes from Fairfax to Roslyn. 


You got it from Fairfax to Roslyn, yeah. That's right. Yes, indeed. I remember them. Did you... used to ride them up until about the time they stopped. Well, I'd ride them until they stopped. And after a while, they put these little autorails on there to run on the rails and run on the road too. 


And after that, they had the process. Yeah. Did you use a little autorail some day? Yes, I used to ride a little autorail too. Were they fun to ride on? Yes, there was fun to ride on. That's right. Did any of them ever have any mishaps? 


No, they never had no mishaps. I never had no trouble in our oil. Mm-hmm. Well, do you remember E.B. Henderson? Oh, yes, I remember Mr. Henderson, E.B. Henderson, and Ms. Henderson. His wife was my children's teacher, Ms. 


Henderson. His wife? She killed her teacher. Yes, she was a teacher. She was talking about Jane Blee's school at that time. Uh-huh. For my children. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. And you probably got acquainted with E.B. 


too. Yes, indeed. But I used to work for Ms. Henderson. Over on Maple? That's right. I used to work for that. She had authorized so bad, she couldn't do her work. Uh-huh. And I used to go there and help her. 


But when, what time was that? When was that? Well, that's been a good many years. I don't think I could tell you exactly what year. What year? Before the big war? Before World War I walked in? Oh, yes, a long time before that. 


It must have been around about 1930 or 39. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. How about Kato Adams? You remember him? Who? Kato Adams? No, I don't remember him. You don't remember him? Mm-hmm. He lives in Washington now, but he used to live with the Hendersons. 


No, I didn't know him. No, I really didn't know him. Did you ever hear of him? No, I never heard of him. Yes, sir. He lived out here for quite a while. Yeah. He's a real fun man. Yeah. No. No, I never heard of him. 


Yeah. He's, uh, he lives in Washington now. Oh, he lives in Washington now. And while, just before E.B. died, his two sons were here. Mm-hmm. Uh, and I met them both. Yeah, but I have never even met her son. 


And then, uh... But it was off in college when I was, uh... Then in 1975, I think it was, we had a reception for E.B. Yeah. Over at the Second Baptist Church. Yeah, I remember that. You do? Yeah. Were you there? 


No, I wasn't there. You remember about it, though? Yeah, I remember about it. Yeah. And then he lived only about a year after that. That's right. He was a great old man. Yes, he was. He was a nice man. 


How about Reverend Powell? Did you know Reverend Powlett? Yeah, he was my minister. And? He was the one that loved to have the one that baptized me at Second Baptist Church. At Second Baptist? Mm-hmm. 


And he lived over on Virginia. That's right. He sure did. Right next to the library. That's right. He lived right there. That's where he lived. That house was built along about the time of the Spanish-American War just before 1900. 


You mean the one he lived in was there by that time? Yeah? I thought it was an old place. Well, along that corner he wouldn't look at it. We'd hardly believe it now if you look at it. That's right. That's how it used to be. 


That's right. Mm-hmm. Do you remember about the people who used to live on West Broad Street? About, do you know where the, in the 400 block where the flower shop is now? There used to be some tinners. 


Ollie Tinner used to live there. Ollie Tinner? Mm-hmm. That's where he used to live. There were some turners, too, weren't there? There still was, but I can't believe it. You never knew them very well. 


No, there was some tailors over there, too. Yeah, tailors. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, tailors. Tinner, Taylor, and I guess some turns, too. Yeah, lived down there. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's been a long time ago. 


Well, are you enjoying living in an apartment? Yes, I'd love to live in an apartment. I lived over there. I raised all my kids over there on Railroad Avenue, though. Oh, let me ask you. If you come down Railroad Avenue from Fowler Street, who lives in the last house? 


Well, that's where my father lived. That was his house. That's where he lived. That belongs to my husband and Charlie Reckon. Charlie Reckon and my husband. Well, who is the old gentleman that lives there now? 


You see, the old gentleman lives there? Yeah. Well, that's supposed to be my husband. But we've been separated for 30 years. Oh, you've been separated for 30 years? Yeah. What's his first name? He doesn't have his name after his daddy, William Henry Rector. 


William Henry Rector. How old is he? He's 80, 81. 81? Uh-huh. Is he in good health, I hope? Well, I tell you, he's in good health, and the only thing, he's got bad feet. Uh-huh. And we try to get him to go to the hospital to be operated on. 


But he don't want him to do it. Uh-huh. And that's the house where you raise your 16 children? No. Just before you get to that house, there's another little house, two rooms. Uh-huh. I raised my kids in them two rooms. 


Oh, yes. That's right, my father-in-law. Brought the land from my, uh, from his dog, my sister-in-law, and he put two, there were two rooms on that, on that piece of land, for half an acre. Two rooms, yeah. 


Uh-huh. Yeah, and I raised my kids, all of them, and they got napped there for, oh, I guess, for years. I was there for about 30 years. About 35 years. 35, might have been 40. And just those two rooms all that time? 


That's two rooms all that time. What'd you do, stack them on top of each other? I guess I did. Sometimes I think to myself, I in a world did I raise all them kids in two rooms, but I sure did. I raised them in two rooms, and my husband was a man like this. 


He wouldn't work, I mean, he did, all he'd done was got children, but he didn't work, kept their care, kept, you know, make-away from. Uh-huh. So I raised them myself. I worked there, like, I used to work for Mr.

Yeah. Well, I worked for him, and I used to work for another restaurant he called Donnell, down there on the... Garden Hill? Yeah, on Hillwood Avenue. On Hillwood Avenue? Yeah, I worked there, too, for about 10 years. 


Who was the man who ran that? The man who ran that, his name was Jimmy Malice. Jimmy Malice? That was how I think he was a Greek. I tell you what, I don't know which. He was the one helping to develop Mal Brooke. 


You know, down in Sleepy Hollow? Yeah. Yeah, Jimmy Malice. Yeah. He was involved in that development down there. Oh, he was? Yeah. Yes, well, I didn't know he was still living or not. Wasn't there another man?

## Historical Context

This interview with Anna Mary Rector provides a valuable window into the African American experience in Falls Church from the 1920s through the 1980s. Born in Leesburg, Anna Mary Rector came to Falls Church around 1925 (she mentions coming "down here 50 years ago" during the 1980 interview) and married into the Rector family, a well-established Black family in the area.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Family Connections**: Anna Mary Rector was married to William Henry Rector Jr., whose father (William Henry Rector Sr.) had worked for the Rowells, a prominent white family. This employment relationship provides insights into the economic interdependencies between white and Black communities in early 20th century Falls Church.

2. **Labor and Employment**: Rector describes various jobs she held throughout her life, including working for prominent local establishments such as Bryant's restaurant in the Rust Shopping Center, a restaurant on Hillwood Avenue, and for E.B. Henderson's wife who had "arthritis so bad." These employment patterns illustrate the economic opportunities available to Black women in Falls Church during this period.

3. **Housing Conditions**: Rector's description of raising 16 children (15 surviving) in a tiny two-room house on Railroad Avenue provides powerful testimony about housing conditions for Black families in segregated Falls Church. She mentions living there for approximately 40 years, indicating the stability but also the limitations of housing options for Black residents.

4. **Black-Owned Businesses**: The interview references several Black-owned businesses and professionals, including George Washington Thomas (the "shoe man"), Robinson (who had a barber shop under the bank), and a mention of Eugene Tree's store "on the corner." These businesses formed an important part of the economic foundation of Falls Church's Black community.

5. **Interracial Relations**: Rector's matter-of-fact descriptions of working for white employers and her familiarity with various parts of Falls Church suggest a community where racial boundaries existed but with complex everyday interactions across those boundaries.

6. **Transportation**: Her references to riding "the rails" (the trolley that went from Fairfax to Rosslyn) and later the "autorails" document the transportation options available to residents in the early-to-mid 20th century and how they connected Falls Church to the broader region.

7. **Religious Life**: Rector mentions Second Baptist Church, noting it was where her father-in-law was buried and where Reverend Powell served as minister. This church was a central institution in Falls Church's Black community, providing not only spiritual guidance but also serving as a community gathering place.

8. **The Great Depression**: When asked about the Depression, Rector notes that she "got along just fine" because her parents lived on a farm where they grew food. Her comment that she "didn't have nothing to make or lose" provides insight into how economic crises affected different segments of society in different ways.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While Anna Mary Rector's interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides important context for the renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Inclusive Community History**: Any renaming initiative should acknowledge and incorporate the experiences of all community members, including historically marginalized groups. Rector's interview offers perspectives from Falls Church's African American community that should be considered as part of the full historical context for renaming discussions.

2. **Continuity of Place**: Rector's long-term residency in Falls Church (over 50 years at the time of the interview) and her detailed knowledge of local geography and changes over time demonstrate the deep roots many families have in the area, regardless of socioeconomic status. These enduring connections to place should be respected in any renaming conversation.

3. **Multi-dimensional Understanding**: The interview reveals aspects of Falls Church history that might not appear in official documents or mainstream historical accounts. This more complex, multi-dimensional understanding of the community's past is essential for making informed decisions about names that accurately reflect the area's authentic heritage.

4. **Geographical Knowledge**: Rector's familiarity with various locations throughout Falls Church, including Railroad Avenue, Fowler Street, West Broad Street, and other areas, provides insights into how residents understood and navigated the community's geography before modern development. This helps establish the historical context for how place names evolved and were used by different community members.

5. **Community Connections**: The interview highlights the interconnectedness of Falls Church's residents across racial lines, even during segregation. These connections form an important part of the community's identity and should be acknowledged in discussions about names that represent the area's heritage.

Anna Mary Rector's recollections offer a perspective that enriches our understanding of Falls Church's history beyond the dominant narrative, demonstrating that a complete picture of the community's past must include diverse voices and experiences. Her story of raising 15 children in a two-room house while working various jobs throughout the community represents the kind of determination and resilience that has shaped Falls Church throughout its history.

*Location: Falls Church, Virginia*

## Transcript

Thank you. The 10th of January, 1980, the home of Thomas E. Frazier, 2720 North Underwood Street. And this house is located on what was once a crosswind farm. Looking right out the front door, you look at the Bishop of Colonel High School, which was the center of the farm and was the dairy farm until what year, Tom? 

1950, I imagine it was, 1949. When Bill Crossman Jr., who was the last one to run it, sold out and moved out to another dairy farm near Herndon. When was your house built, Tom? 1951. Well, where did you live before you came to Falls Church? 

I lived in colonial village in Arlington. Where did you live in Arlington? I lived on North Edwards Street, 1618 North Edwards Street, where you lived as a whaler, Francis Whaler. Well, where did you, was this your native area? 

No, my home was in Petersburg. Petersburg? Yeah. Then what account? When did you come to this area? January 24, 1935. And where did you come? You got a job. And you got a job, yeah. I applied for a job at a phone company in Richmond, and they called my brother-in-law. 

I didn't have a telephone at the time. They had a job in Claringville, Virginia, for three weeks. I wanted the job, and I said, sure, I'll take the job. He said, well, go to Pittsburgh and get on the train tonight. 

The train leaves at 11 o'clock. And go to Alexandria. A man named Quitmire will meet you at the train at 4 o'clock. He came on to Alexandria. He met me. He had a room for me at the Gilshy Funeral Hall. 

Wiltshire on West Broad Street? No, on Washington Boulevard in Clarendon. Oh, okay. Good. And I lived with them for about a year and a half, I guess. And I worked here. Well, they're the same Wiltshire's that had a funeral home in Falls Church at one time? 

They could be, but I didn't know it. You didn't know that. Okay, go ahead. At that particular time... The day that I got here, there was about 18 inches of snow on the ground. And I went to work, and when my three weeks were up, I went in to see the boss, and I said, well, my three weeks was up. 

He said, well, we'll let you have a day off. I hadn't been off the same old days for three weeks. He said, we'll let you have a day off, and then we would hire you back Tuesday. So I would hire you back on Tuesday. 

And then every three months, I had to take a day off until I'd been here nine months. You'd be hired back each time? Hired back each time. And I've been here ever since. This year, I was celebrating my 45th anniversary with a phone call. 

January 1980. 45th. Well, when did you first move out to the Falls Church? I moved here in 1949. I lived with Wilson in the park over on Patrick Henry Drive. And I had bought this land up here in 1947. 

I built my house. in 1950 and we'll begin in 1951. I was moved here in 1936 by the phone company to take care of the telephone service in the Falls Ridge area, which at that time included Great Falls, Forestville, Greensville, Annandale, and down Columbia Pike to the Oval House I was over there by what is now Florida Street, Bailey's Crossroads, and down to Lexington Street and Arlington. 

That was the Falls Ridge area. Consider me better bigger than the two square miles of Falls Church Probrille When I say Falls Church in the telephone sense, I mean the area served by the switchboard located in Falls Church Where in Falls Church in the old stone bank of on a loot seven and Lee Highway up on the third floor upon the third floor There were approximately 3,000 lines In that particular office and in those days the line consists of anywhere from 2 to 18 parties per line So we had a great deal more subscribers than we had lines Lines that went up Tysons Corner night the forest bill and the drain bill at anywhere from 12 to 18 people you party liners had a good time sometimes I expect. 

Did you go clear out the Herndon went right to the. Herndon Road in route seven. I forget that route number. But it's just beyond Drainsville as the road goes back into Herndon. You know where that shopping center is. 

That's Herndon Junction. That's where the Falls Church service turned. The brick house on the right just before you get to Sugarland Run was the last house we had in the Falls Church area. Well go way back to the time when there were no telephones. 

Would you. Talk about how the telephone system developed as you know it. As I know it I worked on telephone lines that were one wire grounded circuit. Instead of taking two wires there was one wire and the grounded every station and they talked between the ground and the wire. 

Very no way the line. And they had a crank on the wall and they cranked them up. Then they came along and put in the manual telephone which required. Are you familiar with any churches part in getting that only from here say. 

Merton Potter. Reggie Roberts White. With two people that came over to Bell System when they purchased the telephone from any church they were still here when I was here. What are their names again? Potter. 

A.J. Potter. A.J. Potter. P-O-T-T-E-R. And Sadie Roberts. Roberts, yeah. She was Reggie Roberts' wife who was a painting contractor in Falls Church. And these two people came from any churches set up? 

Well, they were employed by Emmy Church and when the telephone company, the Bell System, bought him out, those employees came over to the Bell System. Well, how did, uh, how did Emmy Church get, happen to, or how did he go about getting the system as he developed? 

Developed. You know, I don't know that, you don't know that at the phase of it. You don't know the Camp Auger phase of it, no. Well, go ahead. We had this 3,000-line office and served this big expanse area, which wasn't very thick to populate again. 

You could drive out of Falls Church a mile and be out in the country, yeah, none, and particularly when you went towards Annandale, or you went towards Tyson's Corn. We had very few cables, as you see on the street today. 

Most of it in those days was wire on poles. We only had cables when I could wire. Yeah, and then bare wire. Going towards Maryfield, it just went beyond where 495 is now, cables is, and it picked up wire and went on out into the country. 

Going up towards Tyson's, it only went as far as up there, just beyond Nye's Orchard, and then it took off and wired again. Another feed went up Westmoreland Street, up to what we call Pole 127, which is at the corner of Westmoreland and 123, old 123. 

And from that junction, it went all directions, from there to Forestville, up to Old Dominion Drive, McLean, on work that way. That was a feed up that way. And another feed went up week seven, that way, and then another one went to Town of Vienna from Tyson's Corn. 

And one of the main toll lines for AT&T went from Washington to Tyson's and cable and took off to Tyson's and went to the North. Lynchburg in open wire, a copper wire. And I had worked on that for the many days. 

That went through to Centerville from Vienna to Centerville and then on across the country and down twenty-nine to Lynchburg. What was this big bevy of wires overhead on Lee Highway in 1960, for instance? 

It used to be about two hundred wires. That was the same type thing and went down into the valley, going down that way. Not in the Centerville Valley. It went on up there. The Centerville Valley has always been an independent company. 

Yeah, it went on down in the Piedmont to Charlottesville and Lynchburg. But that was owned by AT&T. That was what we call a toll line. total, long distance. Why was all that changed? You'd get more circuits out of it and you'd provide noiseless telephone service. 

The big why I got was subject to wind, storm, and rain and got noisy, and the circuits weren't too good. And you could only put so many circuits on it. With cable, you've got it encased and you can use it with carrier, which is a system that can put many conversations over four wires. 

And it needs to be very quiet and with a built-in cable. And it was much easier to maintain. Was the naked wire subject to just open noises like traffic noises? That sort of thing? No, not traffic noises. 

Pick up radio transmissions at times, depending on atmospheric conditions or conditions of the wire. Where the sleeve connects two wires together, they twisted those by hand to make a good connection. 

Corrosion would set up in that connection and would act just like a crystal. And you could hear the radio stations right on the telephone line without radio. Be on there while you were talking. And see, during this period of time, there was a big expansion in the use of telephone service as far as Falls Church and the area was concerned. 

Can you say, what do you mean by which period of time now? During 1935. And the war came along and slowed down, but in 1946, we had more subscribers waiting for telephone service than we could possibly serve, because we couldn't get the materials. 

The materials had been, we didn't get anything during the war to put telephones in there. Nothing. Everything went for the military up. So we had this big backlog, and we were hiring people like mad, trying to catch up. 

And that's when we built this Lee-Dowell Center right there at the end of this street, 1947. Underwood and Lee Highway, yeah. And that was the beginning of the expansion of telephone service in the growth of this area. 

Right then, 1947. That's when the big expansion took place. What was the Axminster, what would you call it? Axminster Exchange or telephone number. We didn't have any more numbers in Falls Church to serve customers with telephone numbers. 

But they had some numbers in Arlington, Danny Cline, that they sent up here by cable. It was Washington Boulevard and Lee Highway on cable. And from there, they picked up the local cables and carried them out to these people who lived in the adjacent area. 

We took them off the Falls Church Exchange, gave them Axminster Exchange, took those Falls Church numbers and put them out further in the country, where we had Falls Church services. We could double, almost double the amount of telephone we had if we were doing that. 

And then in 1947, what we did, we cut the cable going to Clarings on Washington Boulevard and turned it into the office at Lee Highway, 6700 Lee Highway, which is only a block from that intersection. 

So we picked up all those Axminster numbers and gave them Falls Church numbers again. So we would swap horses a lot to give service. Same way with Kenmore. Kenmore service, which is 536 now, is a Arlington service, but it served at Falls Church. 

And we did that because we didn't want to put the cable in from Arlington all the way up into the area of Lexington Street and Little Falls Road. So we turned those cables around and brought them back to Falls Church and gave them Kenmore service, which was served as the same toll center as Arlington services were. 

The art terrace prohibited us. us from taking, say, false church numbers and working them out of a toll center that's not subject to false church. The tariffs are different, the rate, toll rates are different. 

In those days, we had a big conglomeration of numbers and services, yet we had to keep them segregated by toll centers because the rates were different and we couldn't change the rates. Since that period of time, we've been able to change the rates and combine a lot of these exchanges together and give them the same toll center so that they can call and be called at a decent rate. 

It gets very complicated. I believe you. I was here during that period of time and having worked outside. as a service man for 15 years, I went into the central office to control and test and get the work done outside. 

Then we had to follow a circuit. And we grew from two installers, Walter Fallon and myself, up to 15 or 20 installers in a period of time between 1946 and 1948. So we had that much growth. Is Walter Fallon the man who used to be on the town council? 

He used to live around here. No, he doesn't live here, he lives in Murrow. Walter left here. Oh, there's another Fallon who lives around here. That's his son. Oh, that's his son, yeah. He was in the Kiwanis Club, Billy Fall. 

Well, you mentioned one time when I was talking to you about an incident in connection with a bad ice storm. Did you? Yeah. We had several of those. Do you want to tell me about a couple of them? Yeah, the one that I remember most vividly was the one that happened on Palm Sunday, 1942, that most of the service in Paul's church was down on the ground, so to speak. 

They were out of service. Because Broad Street, from one end to the other, from what is now Seven Corners, all we had to... Lemon Road was nothing but big maple trees, big old maple trees, and that snowstorm came in just about the time that they were getting small leaves on it. 

May of 1942. May? No. 1942? April. March. The latter part of March. There was a big, heavy, wet snow. Big, heavy, wet snow. And it just tore down those trees, just tore them all to pieces, and it carried all the telephone plant with it when they fell. 

It went down on the ground. We were months getting those things back. When I first came here, they had had a sleet storm from Washington to Charlottesville. It covered that general area. And the wires that you spoke of a few minutes ago that went up Lee Highway, they were down for miles, poles, wire, and everything. 

That's when we started replacing it with cable for years in that was 1932 We were still working on it when I came here in 1935 replacing that stuff They had Laid wire on the ground insulated wire on the ground With no poles to get the service back in and it was still on the ground three years later And still work And we put that stuff back up in the air and paid And I haul copper wire to get a shawl still one of my first jobs was driving the truck all in copper wire And dumping along the road to get a shawl still so that they could put the wire back up Did you have any particular Personal Experiences and connection with this big storm of 42 Yeah, 

I can remember My boss called me at 2 o'clock in the morning And asked me if I could get out and I said get out I can go anywhere I want to go he said well, do you know we got about 18 inches of snow everything? 

I said no, but I can still go So I was living in clarity time so I came to Falls Church in my own car And picked up a truck and went out and got operated and brought them in to work that day That's all I did that day was show for operators to get them into work There's nobody could move you remember and who any of the operators were best of shoemakers one of them You know best of shoemakers? 

No She's still around And she's around someplace. I haven't seen her for years, but her husband used to be the town sergeant I picked up savior Robert. She's not around anymore. She died a couple of years ago. 

And how did you manage to get down on the drug street? Well, we ran, went around it. We drive, we drive on the streets. Yeah, as far as if you go on one street and you go back and go around another one and they carry the axes and saws with us and cut our way through it. 

How long did it take you to get to the center of town? I don't really call, but it, it moved along pretty fast. It's, uh, didn't take me long to get from my house where I was living then to the garage to pick up the truck and get the chains on. 

During this period of time, the state highway people and the city people were planning the streets too, where they just had one path through there at all. So we were able to move around a little bit. 

I can remember, you remember Dopkin's Market down in the corner? We had a pole sitting right over the front of the first door. It had a cross to make a box on it. It had three great big cables on it, big cables. 

The tree had fallen right across that thing and broke it down to the ground, but it didn't break the cable off. So that's why the cable came down the pole and went on the ground. So it just broke the pole off and pulled the cable off, but it didn't break it off, and it was still working. 

That was in 1942, then. How long did that storm interrupt the telephone service? I would say that we had most of the telephones back in service some kind of way in three or four weeks, but we were a long, long time getting back to where the plant was serviceable like we wanted. 

That's the pole we put back in and all this mess, because we laid wires on the ground where we could to get the telephones back in. We laid on the ground, and when we came to the street, we laid in the garden, and wherever we could go. 

We took care of the police and the doctors, people like that first. Was that the worst storm of that kind that you recall? In this particular area now, I went to Connecticut in 1938. On a hurricane storm, it was the worst I'd ever seen. 

I worked in Connecticut for six weeks rebuilding. plant that had been thrown down by a hurricane. But the 42 storm was the worst one in this area that we experienced. 1957, well, 58, I always get this mixed up. 

We had one that did a lot of damage, but the telephone service wasn't out everywhere like it was in 42. Pembit Hills, we had just been built. They were built on Stanley Rowan, was building it then. And that was a rattle of flimsy built house. 

Telephone wires had been attached to a mold and it went up beside the roof. And when the heavy snow hit it, it pulled the molding off. It pulled the molding off the Harrison and Wyethall on the ground. 

We had over 5,000 of those things. laying on the ground over here at one time, and telephones were working, but the wires were on the ground, likewise and telephones were on. That particular storm seemed to hit from the wall of churches and then landed on towards Tyson's, and up that area more than he did from seven corners to Bailey's Crossroads. 

No. I've been in supervision since 1951. During that particular period of time, I had as high as 150 people reporting to me during a storm like that. He bought them from everywhere we were born and brought them in here to restore service. 

Luckily it doesn't happen all over the country at one time. That's how I got into Connecticut. We had over 3,000 telephone men sending New England from the Bell system during that time. What year was this? 

1938. Oh, that was right after that big hurricane. You really can't visualize how much strength wind and water had. They had boats a mile, three quarters of a mile off the coast, sitting up on dry land when that thing left. 

As far as you could see. I remember that storm very well. They had a tremendous amount of wire, like you spoke of a minute ago, we call it open wire. Just pay a wire on hold. on the Boston Post Road, I never forget it as long as I lived, they had ten cross arms with ten wires each on them. 

And they were all laying on the ground, caught up with the pile wire. They cut the pile off at seven o'clock in the morning, everywhere. We'd go to work, and when we came in it talked and turned the pile back on again. 

You couldn't work right there with the pile. It was all messed up together. You didn't know what was the telephone pile and what was the light pile. So they just turned it off. Well, safely they turned it off so the workmen could go out and do the work. 

How long did that stay up here? Six weeks. Well, you've lived around Falls Church since 1935. A lot of things have happened. during that time and there have been a lot of changes since that time. You want to talk about just Falls Church as a community and as people and you spoke about. 

Well let's talk about the community. Community consisted primarily of stores on Broad Street and Lee Highway. It didn't extend much beyond where R.B. Park or where you are now. Businesses didn't go any further than the rest of the residents is primarily older homes. 

Most of them use coal for heat and then the seven corners wasn't as seven corners as now the Virginia foot. Thanks for watching! 

## Historical Context

Thomas Fraser's interview provides a detailed account of the development of telecommunications infrastructure in Falls Church and the surrounding region during the mid-20th century. Fraser moved to the area in January 1935 and worked for the telephone company for 45 years, giving him a unique perspective on the area's development through the lens of its communications infrastructure.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Telephone Infrastructure Development**: Fraser provides a detailed chronology of how telephone service evolved in Falls Church from early one-wire grounded circuits with hand cranks to more sophisticated systems. His description of the technical evolution includes the shift from open wire on poles to underground cables, reflecting broader patterns of infrastructure modernization in the post-war period.

2. **M.E. Church's Role in Early Telecommunications**: The interview references Merton Elbridge Church (M.E. Church), an important Falls Church entrepreneur who established the area's first telephone system before it was purchased by the Bell System. Church was a significant figure in Falls Church's commercial development, and Fraser notes that some of Church's employees, including A.J. Potter and Sadie Roberts, continued working after the Bell System acquisition.

3. **Geographic Service Areas**: Fraser describes in detail the extent of the Falls Church telephone service area, which was much larger than the city itself. It included Great Falls, Forestville, Greensville, Annandale, parts of Columbia Pike, Bailey's Crossroads, and extended to the Herndon Road. This helps map the regional connections and service networks that linked Falls Church to surrounding communities.

4. **Infrastructure Challenges**: The interview documents major weather events that affected telecommunications, particularly the Palm Sunday storm of 1942 that brought down trees and telephone lines throughout Falls Church. Fraser's descriptions of the cleanup and restoration efforts provide insights into how the community responded to infrastructure crises.

5. **Post-War Expansion**: Fraser describes a significant backlog of telephone service requests after World War II due to material shortages during the war years. The construction of the Lee-Dowell Center at Underwood and Lee Highway in 1947 marked "the beginning of the expansion of telephone service in the growth of this area," linking telecommunications development directly to the post-war suburban expansion.

6. **Residential Development**: The interview notes that Fraser built his home in 1950-51 on land he had purchased in 1947, which was formerly part of the Crossman farm. This timing aligns with the post-war housing boom and the conversion of agricultural land to residential use throughout the region.

7. **Exchange Systems**: Fraser explains the complex system of telephone exchanges (Falls Church, Axminster, Kenmore) and how they were managed and reconfigured to accommodate growing demand. His explanation of how numbers had to be assigned based on toll centers provides insight into how early telephone networks influenced community boundaries.

8. **Rural-to-Suburban Transition**: Fraser's observation that "you could drive out of Falls Church a mile and be out in the country" in the 1930s, combined with his description of gradual infrastructure expansion outward from the town center, documents the transitional period when Falls Church was evolving from a rural village to a suburban community.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

Thomas Fraser's interview offers several connections to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Regional Interconnectedness**: Fraser's detailed description of the telephone service area demonstrates how Falls Church was connected to neighboring communities through infrastructure networks. This regional perspective supports understanding Falls Church's historical relationship to geographical features like Little Falls of the Potomac.

2. **Geographical References**: Fraser mentions specific location names and routes, including the Herndon Road, Tyson's Corner, Forestville, and other landmarks that help establish the historical geography of the area. These reference points can help document how residents understood the region's geography.

3. **Infrastructure Development Timeline**: The interview provides a clear timeline of development from the 1930s through the 1970s, which helps establish when certain areas were developed and how place names might have evolved during this transitional period.

4. **M.E. Church Connection**: The references to M.E. Church's role in establishing early telephone service highlight an important historical figure whose name became associated with the area. This illustrates how individual contributions can become embedded in community identity - a relevant consideration for any renaming initiative.

5. **Land Use Transformation**: Fraser's home was built on former Crossman farmland, which exemplifies the transition from agricultural to residential land use that transformed Falls Church in the mid-20th century. This transformation represents a pivotal period when community identity was being redefined.

6. **Historical Continuity**: The interview describes technological changes over time while maintaining references to consistent geographical features and communities. This balance between change and continuity mirrors the considerations involved in a renaming initiative that seeks to honor historical connections while addressing contemporary needs.

7. **Natural Disasters as Markers**: Fraser's vivid description of the 1942 Palm Sunday storm provides a reference point for understanding how natural events affected the landscape along Lee Highway, which included "big maple trees" that were damaged by heavy snow. These landscape features help reconstruct the historical environment of Falls Church.

While Fraser does not specifically mention "Little Falls," his detailed account of regional infrastructure development provides valuable context for understanding how Falls Church related to its surrounding geography during a formative period in its development. His perspective as someone who witnessed and facilitated the area's communication connections offers a unique lens for understanding the community's evolution.

The property being offered combines agricultural, industrial, and commercial components that were typical of valuable riverfront properties in the early Federal period.

The advertisement is significant for several reasons:

1. It demonstrates the economic importance of water power at the Little Falls of the Potomac for industrial enterprises, particularly flour milling, brewing, and distilling.

2. The presence of "French burr mill stones" indicates a high-quality milling operation - these imported millstones were considered superior for flour production and represented significant investment.

3. The mention of "fish stands" references the commercial fishing operations that were important to the economy of the Potomac River region.

4. Stone quarries on the property underscore the importance of local building materials during the early development of Washington DC and surrounding areas.

5. The proximity to Georgetown, Washington City, and Alexandria positions this property at the center of the developing economic network of the new Federal district.

The advertisement reflects the considerable industrial development already occurring along the Potomac in the early 1800s, a time when the nation's new capital was being constructed.

## Historical Context

This September 1801 advertisement clarifies the ownership and legal context of the valuable industrial property at Little Falls of the Potomac that appeared in a more detailed listing on October 13, 1801. This notice reveals that the property was part of the estate of Lewis Hipkins, deceased, and was being sold according to both his will and a decree from the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia for Alexandria County.

Several important historical details emerge:

1. The property's legal status as part of an estate settlement under court supervision

2. The identification of Lewis Hipkins as the previous owner of this significant industrial complex

3. The presence of a widow (Susan Wren, who had apparently remarried after Hipkins' death) with dower rights to the property

4. The involvement of court-appointed executors (Philip R. Fendall, Robert Young, and William Waters)

5. A requirement for cash payment ("ready money") rather than the common practice of offering credit for large purchases

6. The addition of a second property in Fairfax County where Mrs. Wren was residing

This advertisement demonstrates the complex legal and family considerations involved in transferring significant commercial properties in early 19th century America. It also suggests that the Little Falls industrial complex described in the October 13, 1801 advertisement was not a new development but an established operation that was changing hands through an estate settlement.

## Connection to Previous Advertisement

This sale notice relates directly to the more detailed property advertisement from October 13, 1801. The October advertisement provided more extensive details about the property's features and improvements, while this earlier notice provides context about why the property was being sold. Together, these documents reveal a more complete picture of the ownership, legal status, and transfer of this industrially significant property near the new Federal district.

## Relevance to Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This historical document provides compelling evidence supporting the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative for Falls Church. The repeated references to "Little Falls of the Potomac" in this 1801 advertisement demonstrate that the name "Little Falls" has deep historical roots in Northern Virginia, dating back to at least the early Federal period.

Several aspects of this document are particularly relevant to the renaming effort:

1. **Historical Authenticity**: The name "Little Falls" appears multiple times in this advertisement, confirming its established usage in the region over 220 years ago. This lends historical authenticity to the proposed name change.

2. **Geographic Identity**: The advertisement highlights the significance of Little Falls as a recognized geographic landmark that was important enough to serve as a primary reference point for describing property locations in the area.

3. **Regional Connection**: The mention of a Fairfax County property "about three miles from the said Little Falls" demonstrates the broader regional recognition of Little Falls as a significant geographical feature.

4. **Indigenous Heritage**: While not explicitly mentioned in this document, the prominence of Little Falls in early American documents supports the renaming initiative's goal of highlighting a geographical feature that was significant to the Indigenous peoples who inhabited the area before European settlement.

5. **Economic Significance**: The advertisement illustrates the economic importance of the Little Falls area in early American commerce and industry, substantiating the historical significance of this geographical feature to the region's development.

This document serves as tangible historical evidence that "Little Falls" has authentic roots in the region's past, making it a historically appropriate choice for renaming Falls Church and helping to reconnect the city with its geographical heritage.

# Runaway Advertisement Mentioning Fall's Church Road

## Transcription

Twenty Dollars Reward.
ELOPED from the subscriber, this morning, a Negro woman, called
TEANY,
about 18 years of age. She had on, when she ran away, a jacket and petticoat of blue plains, an oznaburgh apron and a flannel under coat. She has naturally a wild look, and has a large welt upon her back, occasioned by a burn. It is very probable, if she has left town, that she has made for her parents who live at Mr. Turberville's Quarter, about 20 miles from Alexandria, on the Fall's Church road. The above reward will be given to whoever apprehends and secures the abovementioned woman, so as I may get her again.
THOS. RICHARDS.
Feb. 23.

## Historical Context

This advertisement from February 1802 documents the pursuit of Teany, an enslaved woman who sought her freedom by escaping from her enslaver, Thomas Richards. The advertisement provides several historically significant details:

1. The use of the term "eloped" rather than "escaped" or "ran away" - a common phrasing in this period

2. Specific details about Teany's appearance and clothing, including the disturbing mention of a "large welt upon her back, occasioned by a burn"

3. Knowledge that she might be seeking family members at "Mr. Turberville's Quarter" - suggesting family separation was part of her experience

4. Most significantly for place name research, the reference to "the Fall's Church road" as a known geographic feature

The advertisement provides a glimpse into the brutal reality of slavery in early 19th century Virginia, while also documenting the courage of those who sought freedom despite the risks.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This advertisement contains a particularly notable reference to "Fall's Church road" with an apostrophe. This spelling suggests that in 1802, the area was understood to be named after "the Fall's Church" (the church at or of the Falls) rather than being named directly after the geographical feature itself.

Several aspects of this naming convention are significant:

1. **Possessive Form**: The apostrophe in "Fall's" indicates a possessive relationship - suggesting the church belonged to or was associated with "the Fall" as a geographic feature.

2. **Singular "Fall"**: Unlike many later references to "Falls Church," this earlier mention uses the singular "Fall's" rather than the plural "Falls," potentially indicating an evolution in naming conventions.

3. **Road Designation**: The reference to "Fall's Church road" demonstrates that by 1802, the church was established enough to serve as a landmark for a major road, helping travelers navigate the region.

4. **Contemporary Usage**: This spelling variation provides evidence of how locals actually referred to the area in writing during the early 19th century, rather than later standardized spellings.

This document offers important evidence that the area's name has undergone evolution over time, with various spellings and forms documented in historical records. The possessive form "Fall's Church" suggests a closer original connection to the geographical feature (the Fall/Falls) that seems to have been somewhat diminished as the name evolved to the modern "Falls Church."

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1802 advertisement provides significant historical evidence supporting the Little Falls VA renaming initiative in several ways:

1. It documents that even in the early 19th century, the area's name directly referenced "Fall's" as a geographical feature, strengthening the argument for reconnecting the city's name to its geographical heritage.

2. The possessive form "Fall's Church" suggests that the geographical feature (the Fall/Falls) was considered primary, with the church being defined by its proximity to this feature rather than the reverse.

3. This historical evidence of naming variation supports the idea that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing contexts and priorities.

4. The apostrophe in "Fall's Church" creates a direct linguistic link to the proposed "Little Falls" name, as both explicitly reference the geographical feature rather than a religious institution.

This document demonstrates that renaming to "Little Falls" would not be creating a new name but rather returning to the primary geographic reference that appears to have been central to the area's original identity, even when it was known as "Fall's Church."

Lauren Currier, class of 2001, was the winner of the logo contest for the celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the Falls Church City Public Schools. Chosen from over 100 entries from our
youngest students at Mt. Daniel to adult members of our community, the design was the unan-
imous choice of the selection committee. A banner unveiling her original design debuted at the
1997 Memorial Day Parade and it will be displayed at various locations throughout the City
until the anniversary comes to a close in 1999.

Ms. Currier has attended Falls Church City Public Schools since kindergarten. She has received
recognition from the schools for her art work on a number of occasions. It was her design which
was selected as the basis for the TJ Tiger mascot at Thomas Jefferson
Ls CHURG, Elementary School. In addition to her art studies in public school, Ms.
2 Currier has studied at the Art Students League in New York City and at
the Corcoron in Washington, D.C.

The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of our
school system provides a unique opportunity
to reflect on our history and achievements and
to contemplate our future challenges. Our
legacy has been a small city with an active cit-
izenry dedicated to the mission of excellent
public education. Since its inception in 1949,
the Falls Church City independent school sys-
tem has produced a concrete measure of its
excellence in the form of a continuous stream
of well-educated graduates.

As with most pioneering efforts, the early
struggles were great in creating a new organi-
zation from scratch. There were construction
projects and teacher recruiting campaigns,
scheduling conflicts and curriculum concerns.
Somehow the obstacles were overcome and
the challenges were met. The result is the
mature school system we have today—one
nationally recognized for excellence.

In recent years we have seen a repetition of
some of those early challenges. Buildings have
been renovated and new staff hired. New pro-
grams have been introduced. Xerox machines,
VCRs and computers have replaced purple
ditto masters, filmstrip projectors and type-
writers. But one thing has remained the

THE PA

same—the commitment of the community and
the staff to provide the best possible education
to all of the students in the Falls Church City
Public Schools. This commitment to excel-
lence in public education continues to be the
bright light leading us forward as we enter our
second half-century and ahead to the new mil-
lennium.

So join us as we pause briefly to enjoy the cel-
ebration of our pride in the past and our hopes
for the future. Then together we will proceed
on our mission of teaching and learning in the

very special City of Falls Church.

UCTION

As the Falls Church community celebrates the
50th anniversary of its school system, citizens
can reflect with pride on the progress and
accomplishments that have taken place. The
Falls Church City school system has earned an
outstanding reputation within the Washington
area and has received recognition from the
state of Virginia, the U.S. Department of
Education, and the International Baccalaureate
community for its vision and efforts to provide
quality education for its students. Some of the
programs and events that have garnered atten-

tion for Falls Church City schools include:

Creating an Eighth Grade Class

In 1949 Falls Church added grade eight, prior
to the state's mandate, and the Falls Church
curriculum was used as a model to develop
Virginia's curriculum for the additional grade.

Integration

Falls Church was the first city in the state of
Virginia to voluntarily integrate African-Ameri-
can students in 1961.

Kindergarten

Half day kindergarten was started in 1964,
prior to the availability of state funding, and
then extended to full-day kindergarten in the
1973-74 school year.

Extended Day Care

Eight years prior to legislation authorizing day
care, Falls Church launched this program in
1975.

Grade Pattern Reorganization
An innovative grade pattern reorganization
was implemented in the Falls Church schools

in 1979 that included moving sixth grade to
create a middle school of grades six through
eight. The elementary schools were reorga-
nized into K-1 and grades 2-5.

International Baccalaureate Program (IB)
Falls Church was the first Virginia school sys-
tem to offer the IB program to 11th and 12th
grade students. In 1998 a Washington Post
Magazine cover story reported that George
Mason's IB program is one of the most inclu-
sive and wide ranging in the U.S., earning GM
a number one ranking for its IB program in the
Washington area.

Excellence in Education Awards

George Mason Senior High School received
an Excellence in Education award in 1982-83
from the U.S. Department of Education citing
it as one of the country's 144 exemplary sec-
ondary schools. In 1986, Mt. Daniel and
Thomas Jefferson Elementary Schools were
selected to receive the same award. And in
1998, George Mason Middle School won the
US. Dept. of Education's Blue Ribbon Award

for excellence.

Technology

A comprehensive K-12 technology plan devel-
oped by and for the Falls Church City Public
Schools was cited as exemplary by the Virginia
Department of Education. In May 1998
Superintendent Shaw announced the creation
of the Falls Church City Public Schools/
Virginia Tech Technology Learning Center.

Many people worked very hard to mold the
schools the City has today. As you read this
publication and learn more about the history of



=== Page 9 ===

the Falls Church City Public Schools, it is our
hope that you will recognize that budgets and
buildings are critical tools in building a school
system. More importantly, it is citizens with a
vision and commitment to quality education
and citizens working through numerous part-
nerships, that have in the past and will contin-
ue to earn the Falls Church City Public Schools
the role as a leader in pursuit of excellence in
education.

Public Education
Begins In Falls

Church,
1875-1945

Looking back to 1875, one can trace the roots
and the events that have led to the accom-
plishments of the past 50 years. One of the
most significant documents in the history of
education in Falls Church was the resolution in
1875-76 for residents to subscribe to the build-
ing fund for the Jefferson Institute. The resolu-
tion reads as follows:

ee a

We citizens and residents of Falls Church
and vicinity hereby agree and bind our-

names for the purpose of aiding a public

een

Graded School in the village of Falls i

Church for the school year 1875-76.

This resolution marked the beginning of pub-
lic education in Falls Church. Prior to that
time, the children in Falls Church attended a
private school located near The Falls Church
(Episcopal).

Joseph E. Birch donated the land from his farm
for the building, and in the deed specified that
the land should never be used for anything
other than educational purposes. The proper-
ty, located on what is now North Cherry
Street, is the current site of the Child
Development Center of Northern Virginia.
Construction of the Jefferson Institute began
in 1880, and in 1882 the building was opened
for students under the jurisdiction of Fairfax
County. Author and Falls Church resident Ada

Walker wrote of her memories:

I first saw the Jefferson Institute in 1886 when I
was eleven years old. My seatmate and I spent the
noon hour cleaning the plaster off the window glass
in our room, using chips from the wood pile and
plain water.

The building was completed in 1882 after a peri-
od of some 6 or 7 years of organization and fund
raising, during most of which time classes were con-
ducted in the old Columbia Baptist Church on East
Broad Street. The money was raised by the people of
the Falls Church community, by subscription.
Fairfax County furnished the seats, blackboards,
water buckets, and paid the teachers.

Over the 50 years the Falls Church City school system has been in operation, the quality of education has
steadily improved. Many new and innovative programs have been added to the offerings of the school system.
The following time line includes historical events leading up to the beginning of an independent school system in

1949 and follows some of the major events that have occurred and programs that have been implemented in the

Falls Church schools.

The basement bad two rooms—a school room in
front and a furnace room in the back. The first floor
had two classrooms, and the top floor bad a large
stage across one end, and seats in the rest of the
room. At one time it was used as a classroom.
Mostly it was used for commencement exercises,
and later we outfitted it as a gymnasium.

Three teachers took care of all who came, and
taught from the first to the eighth grade. Each
teacher bad from 40 to 60 pupils...

With our fathers, we children gave the school a
lovely flag, a dictionary, a bible, and a clock for
the Principal's room. (Memories of Old Jefferson
Institute, Falls Church, Virginia, by Ada Walker,
June 10, 1964)

By the turn of the century, the Jefferson Insti-
tute, now called the Jefferson School, was used
as a primary school and students of high
school age attended schools in either Fairfax
County or Washington, D.C., since there was
no high school in Falls Church.

Growth in the Schools

The population of the Falls Church area grew
steadily and in the early 1920s, the School
Board for the town began a search for land suit-

able for a new elementary school. In 1923,
after a thorough investigation of several avail-
able properties, a parcel of land on Lee High-
way and Great Falls Street was identified as the
best location for the new school. This piece of
land, containing 2.7 acres and purchased for
$4,850, was the future site of Madison Elemen-
tary School.

With the purchase of land for a new elemen-
tary school, the School Board decided that the
Jefferson School could now be used to meet
the needs of high school students. In April
1923, the School Board decided the Jefferson
School would be offered to Fairfax County on
the condition that it be used to maintain a
four-year consolidated high school. However,
in August 1923, the Fairfax County School
Board would only agree to pay for one more
teacher, enabling the town of Falls Church to
conduct only two full years of high school.
The enrollment of the school district at that
time was 359 students, 20 of those in high
school.

But there was a problem with this plan. The
town of Falls Church lay partly within the
jurisdiction of both Fairfax and Arlington
counties and was situated so that portions of
the town lay within four magisterial dis-

tricts. A “county unit” law enacted in

~ 1923 abolished local school boards and
vested title to property and control of

funds in the hands of county boards.

The result was chaos and forced the stoppage
of all plans for building a new school in Falls
Church. However, in January 1924, House Bill
352 was introduced in the Virginia General
Assembly to create a special school district for
the town of Falls Church. The bill specified
that a district School Board composed of three
members appointed by the town council
would have jurisdiction over the administra-
tion of Falls Church schools. This Board had
the right to be represented on the School
Board of Fairfax County. The title to the
school property was to remain with the School
Board of the town of Falls Church. The admin-
istration of the schools was to be under that
Board, subject to the approval of the county
School Board on all matters of county-wide
concern. Thus, when this bill became law, the
newly formed district Falls Church School
Board was able to proceed with its proposal for
a bond issue to finance a new school building.

“The building was to be of modern design and
attractive appearance to be constructed of brick and
tile or of native stone if found more economical.
There will be 10 class-rooms besides principal’ room
and library and an assembly room seating 400 or
more.” (By Fence and Fireside, by Melvin Lee
Steadman, Falls Church Public Library,
1964) It was to include “all modern conveniences
including drinking fountains, electric lights, cloak
rooms and special safety equipment in case of fire."
(The Commonwealth, September 25, 1926)

1926 at a cost of $86,500. At the School Board
meeting of April 6, 1926, the Board adopted a
resolution naming the school in honor of
James Madison. The school was dedicated on
September 20, 1926.

As James Madison Elementary School was
nearing completion in the fall of 1925, the
Falls Church School Board once again present-
ed the idea for establishing a four-year accred-
ited high school to Fairfax County. The
Jefferson School, they felt, could be used for a
consolidated high school and maintained by
state and county funds. This plan was imple-
mented in 1927, giving Falls Church a well-
established school system for seven years of
elementary school and four years of high
school. It was not until Falls Church had an
independent school system in 1949 that the
eighth grade was added, prior to the state's
mandate. In fact, the curriculum for Falls
Church served as a model to develop the state's
curriculum for the additional grade.

The town of Falls Church maintained its sepa-
rate school system under the jurisdiction of the
Fairfax County School Board until 1942. At
that time, the Virginia State Legislature passed
the McCandlish Act, which abolished the Falls
Church special school district, and stated that
Falls Church schools must be transferred back
to Fairfax County and at no time in the future
could the schools be returned to Falls Church.
In 1945 Fairfax County built Falls Church High
School, later named Whittier School, and

Post World War Il
Brings Growth And
An Independent
School System

New Residents, New Ideas

Following World War II, the population of Falls
Church almost tripled as a result of the rapid
growth of Washington, D.C., and the spill over
into the surrounding areas. This tremendous
increase in population placed a heavy burden
on the town’s services, including its schools.
The administration suggested instituting half-
day sessions and the addition of quonset huts in
back of Madison and Jefferson schools to
relieve overcrowding at the elementary level.
The infrastructure was sorely stressed.

“Outraged parents scrubbed filthy lavatories in
the [Madison] school, banked earth around the
quonset but, scrounged up pieces of floor tile and

tacked them down to keep winter winds from coming
through its floor. The old Jefferson School building
was a fire hazard," remembers city resident

Franklin Thackrey.

The new residents brought different ideas with
them to the city. They demanded higher qual-
ity educational and municipal services than
was customary in rural Virginia and were will-
ing to pay the taxes and float the bonds neces-
sary to finance these improvements. Many
long-time residents, who were accustomed to
low taxes, minimum services, and a pay-as-
you-go fiscal policy, strongly opposed these
notions. With the school system under the
control of the county, many Falls Church resi-
dents were convinced that the town was pay-
ing more in taxes than it was getting back as its

share of school funds.

A desire to gain more control over the City’s
future growth was emerging. But that was not
possible under a town form of government.
There was also growing support to own and
control its own school system. A 1948 special
census conducted by volunteers from the
Parent-Teacher Association found that Falls
Church had more than the 5,000 population

required to become a City of the Second
Class. Despite some opposition, Falls Church
was incorporated in August 1948 as an inde-
pendent city, politically separate from Fairfax
County.

An Independent School System

The desire for an independent school system
finally came to fruition on June 27, 1949, when
the State Board of Education granted Falls
Church the status of a separate school division.
The McCandlish Act was declared unconstitu-
tional, and the Falls Church schools were no
longer part of the Fairfax County school sys-
tem. By becoming an independent school dis-
trict, Falls Church was able to retain, for the
benefit of its own children, the school tax rev-
enues that previously had been spread
throughout the county school system. This
meant that by keeping the same tax rate of
$2.65 per $100 of assessed value that Fairfax
County had charged the city, Falls Church was
able to increase substantially the educational
services provided for its own children.

The next step was to set up a governing board
for the new school system. The first City
School Board was sworn into office by the
Clerk of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County at
8:00 P.M. on Tuesday, July 5, 1949. The nine
members of this first Board were: Mrs. Mark
Regan, Dr. John R. Miles, Dr. Joseph Seay, Mr.

James Lay, Mr. Lyle Webster, Mr. Rex Hinshaw,
Mr. John Johnson, Mrs. John Wallace, and Mr.
George Reeves. Mr. Reeves, who had been the
City’s member on the Fairfax County School
Board, resigned during the first year and was
succeeded by Mr. William Glover. The original
membership of the board was nine, but under
the new City Charter it was dropped to seven.
Helen Regan was elected chairman of the
Board and Dr. Joseph Seay was elected vice-
chairman.

One of the first items the new School Board
had to consider was hiring a superintendent.
The Board's personnel committee recommend-
ed Irvin Schmitt, a former superintendent of
schools in Davenport, lowa. He was appointed
to the position on July 8, 1949, with a salary of
$7,000 per year. The first employee of the new
board was Eleanor Justusson, who was appoint-
ed clerk of the Board. She also served as secre-
tary and generally did everything else that need-
ed to be done. She served the Board in this dual
capacity until she retired in the early 1960s.

In its first year of operation, the Falls Church
school system had a budget of $201,836, two
school buildings, 33 teachers, a superintendent
and one principal. Teachers’ salaries ranged
from $1,900 to $4,200 per year and the per-
pupil cost was $147.98. The average daily
attendance was 763 for city students.

The most urgent problem now facing the
Board was the critical shortage of facilities.
The court settlement dividing the community's
school buildings only conveyed title of the
Madison School and the aging Jefferson
School to the city. The Oak Street Elementary
School (now Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School) and the Falls Church High School
(later named the Whittier School on Hillwood
Avenue) remained under the control of Fairfax
County even though the Falls Church School
Board made every effort to purchase them.
The settlement left the city with no high
school and badly overcrowded and outdated
facilities for elementary students.

Because of space shortages, Falls Church and
Fairfax County resorted to several temporary
arrangements. Without a high school building
of its own, Falls Church had no choice but to
continue to send its high school pupils to Falls
Church High School, owned and administered
by Fairfax County. The County was also facing
an acute shortage of elementary school space in
the Falls Church area. These shortages prompt-
ed the City and County school administrations
to agree, for the time being, to a plan providing
the least possible disruption to the students.
The city continued to allow County children
who had previously attended Madison and
Jefferson schools to remain in those schools,

1952

a A wi 1953

and the county took City students into Oak
Street School and Falls Church High School.

Later, this situation was eased somewhat with
the completion of Falls Church's Mt. Daniel
Elementary School, which opened on January
7, 1952. By the 1952-53 school year, the
exchange with the Fairfax County program was
limited to grades one through three and was
administered so the numbers of City and
County students would be equal, thus cancel-
ing out need for tuition payments. In 1955 the
City purchased Oak Street School and the

exchange program was phased out.

Planning For

New Schools

The School Board conducted a special census
in 1949 to determine the future needs for facil-
ities. This revealed that the number of pre-
school children exceeded the number of
school-age children, indicating increased future
educational needs. In addition, the population
in the area was growing rapidly. Faced with this
situation, the School Board asked the City
Council to call for a referendum to authorize
bonds to finance construction of new buildings.
On November 17, 1949, the voters approved a
$700,000 bond issue. Two school sites were

purchased: the 25-acre Flagg property at
Leesburg Pike and Haycock Road for $40,000,
and the 7.3-acre property owned by Leonard P.
Daniel on North Oak Street for $21,900. These
properties became the sites of George Mason
Junior/Senior High School and Mt. Daniel Ele-
mentary School. Both of these buildings were
planned with possible future expansion in mind
when more money might be available. In the
first stage, the high school was to accommo-
date 325 pupils, and the elementary school was
to contain four classrooms. The bond referen-
dum also provided money for extensive renova-
tions to Madison and Jefferson schools.

In 1950 the School Board proposed a four-year
school construction program to further allevi-
ate overcrowding. This program included the
addition of a multi-purpose room at Madison
School as well as a new roof, rewiring, and the
installation of a gas hot water heater. For the
first time in the school's history, there was hot
water in the lavatories and children no longer
had to wash in icy cold water. The construction
program also called for completion of Mt.
Daniel to contain 12 classrooms, and expansion
of George Mason to accommodate 700 to 800

students and to include an auditorium, library,
cafeteria, and rooms for vocational education.

A shortage of steel delayed construction of
George Mason and Mt. Daniel. In 1951 the
School Board rented temporary space at the
Thompson house at Seven Corners for grades
10 and 11, and used other houses and church
facilities for the elementary students. The.
Jefferson School was used for grades seven,
eight and nine. The School Board passed a res-
olution in 1951 requesting that the Fairfax
County School Board accept all Falls Church
pupils in the 12th grade, and allow them to
attend Falls Church High School on a tuition
basis for the 1951-52 school year.

Building George Mason

With the high school construction nearing
completion, the School Board began soliciting
suggestions for the school name. Proposals
included Old Dominion, Northwestern,
Columbia, Falls Church, Thomas Jefferson,
McArthur, and Haycock. A request was made
to the Fairfax County School Board to change
the name of its Falls Church High School, but

this was denied. Ultimately the name of

George Mason was selected, and the school
was dedicated on October 10, 1952. At the
time of the dedication, George Mason housed
grades seven through twelve with 432 students
and a professional staff of 22 full-time and five
part-time teachers. The 1953 George Mason
yearbook proclaimed, “The formal dedication sig-
naled a new era in secondary education. The great piles
of steel, bricks, and bags of concrete soon grew into this
magnificent and modern building containing gymnasi-
um, laboratory, library, and classrooms.”

That structure marked the first stage in the
development of a facility to accommodate
between 700 and 800 students within the next
three to four years. The building included a
combination gymnasium-auditorium with
dressing and shower rooms, science laboratory,
home economics laboratory, general industrial
arts shop, library, teachers’ room, clinic, cafe-
teria, kitchen, and administration offices. But
sufficient funds were not available to provide
enough space for current enrollment, and addi-
tional classrooms were urgently needed. Due
to severe overcrowding, most of the special
rooms were used as classrooms and the gym
temporarily served as a dining room with a
large section partitioned into classrooms. New
federal and state appropriations provided
funds for an addition in 1953 to alleviate the
situation until the City could provide more
money. These appropriations, known as
Federal Impact Aid, were given to areas with a
large population of federal government
employees. Future additions were to include a
dining room, additional shops, a visual educa-
tion room in conjunction with the library,
more administration space, several more class-
rooms, and an auditorium.

The school rented adjacent land owned by Dr.
Oscar E. Kiessling as a temporary athletic
field. The School Board paid Dr. Kiessling
$200 a year for the use of the field, adding a
focal point for the new school.

We were never as proud of our school as we were
the day they dedicated our football field. There were
so many reasons to be proud. Our fathers had been
out there with shovels, axes, picks, rakes and their
bare bands and bad cleared the field. Our band,
decked out in their new red and white uniforms, made
every one of us beam as they marched around the
field. (1954 yearbook)

On October 3, 1953, at the first game ever
played on the George Mason athletic field, a
plaque was presented to John C. Yarbrough on
behalf of the Falls Church School Board, the
faculty, and students. This plaque was in
recognition of Mr. Yarbrough’s leadership in
the difficult task of clearing away the forest
that had stood there fifteen months earlier.
This marked the beginning of a sports program
that has played an important role in the life of
George Mason since 1953.

Mt. Daniel Construction

In addition to the construction of George
Mason High School, the City had further
plans to house its growing student population.
Mt. Daniel was the first elementary school to
be constructed after Falls Church became a
separate school district. The building was
designed so it could be built in stages as funds
became available. The first section of Mt.
Daniel consisted of four rooms and was ready
for occupancy in February 1952. Two more

primary rooms were added to Mt. Daniel in
1953. The third section was completed in
April 1956.

The completed building consisted of 12 class-
rooms, a multi-purpose room, library, teachers’
room, and principal's office with conference/
clinic room, several storage rooms, cafeteria,
kitchen, and boiler room. The building housed
grades one through six, accommodating around
300 children. The approximate cost of the fin-
ished plant, including grounds, building, archi-
tects’ fees, and equipment, was $700,000. The
completed Mt. Daniel Elementary School was
dedicated in May 1956. In 1989, Mt. Daniel
underwent a $2 million renovation which added
classroom space and a new media center, updat-
ed the heating and air conditioning systems,
and replaced the windows and doors to make
the building more energy-efficient.

Oak Street Elementary School

When George Mason and Mt. Daniel were
being constructed, Oak Street Elementary
School was still owned by Fairfax County,
even though it was physically in the city limits
of Falls Church. The County opened the
school for use in September 1948, but it was
not completely finished until February 1949.
The school was designed to accommodate 450
students, but because of the increased area stu-

Oak Street School transferred to
Falls Church from Fairfax County;

dent population, its enrollment in September
1950 was already 932. To handle so many stu-
dents, half-day sessions were instituted, tem-
porary classrooms were set up in the cafeteria,
and the library space was used as a classroom.
The actual library was relocated in a small
room, and mothers served as librarians. In
1954, Falls Church began negotiations with
Fairfax County to acquire the Oak Street
School. The city agreed to pay $385,000 for
the building, and took ownership on July 19,
1955, upon completion of the new Fairfax
County schools in the immediate vicinity of

Falls Church.

Closing the Jefferson School

With four elementary schools now in the City,
the School Board decided the old Jefferson
School was no longer needed. A local newspa-
per mourned its passing:

Jefferson School, Belfry
And All, Retired At 81

Battered but unbowed, the old Jefferson School in Falls
Church has been retired for school purposes. The two-
story brick building which has pigeons in its belfry is 84
years old (sic).

The belfry is old Jefferson's proudest possession. Modern

schools have their fancy tiled walls, intricate mazes of
corridors, cafeterias, libraries and assorted other doo-

dads.
Belfry Distinguished It

Old Jefferson had none of these. Just six classrooms,
only five of which were school-worthy....

A few old-time residents of the city recall bow the big bell
used to echo through the country streets. It could be heard
two miles away, according to their stories. When the big
bell became too much of a weight for the sagging belfry

to bear it was taken down and put in storage.
Old Jefferson may not be permitted the luxury of a
graceful retirement. City officials are making plans to

restore the building, possibly for use as a museum.

Standing looking up at Old Jefferson's Belfry, listening

to the wind bum through the vents and thinking about the
restoration plans, it's easy to imagine the old building
chuckling complacently to itself:

“Theres life in Old Jeff yet.”
(Washington, D.C.Evening Star, April 18, 1956)

On March 6, 1956, the title to the Jefferson
School was transferred to the Falls Church City
Council, and the school, despite talk of making
it a museum, was torn down in November 1958.

Subsequently, the Falls Church City Council
passed a resolution renaming the Oak Street
School the Thomas Jefferson Elementary School
to commemorate the old Jefferson School. In
the last push to handle the increasing enroll-
ment in the Falls Church City Public Schools,
two classrooms were added to Thomas Jefferson
in 1959. At long last, Falls Church had an inde-
pendent school system with adequate facilities
to house all of its students!

Controversy Over
Funding Marks First
Decade

The establishment of a complete school sys-
tem was not accomplished, however, without
controversy. During the first decade, political
strife in the city was heated and the schools
remained at the center of the storm. Some res-
idents vigorously opposed the approval of the
bond issue for the new high school, the reno-
vation of Madison, and the purchase of land
for George Mason and Mt. Daniel, preferring
to remain a part of the Fairfax County school
system. This faction gained control of the Falls
Church City Council in 1951 and ordered an
investigation of the School Board based on
charges of malfeasance. They felt the facilities
the School Board was using to house the stu-
dents were grossly inadequate, which rein-
forced their desire to remain part of the coun-
ty system. The controversy was fed by the
delays in construction of the new buildings
resulting from postwar steel shortages.

Claiming harassment as a result of the investi-
gation, six of the seven members of the School
Board offered their resignations. The seventh
member was out of the country at the time. But
support for the Board was quickly forthcom-
ing. Several hundred citizens attended the
Council meeting at which the resignations
were considered, demanding that the Council
not accept them. However, the Council did
accept the resignations and a new School
Board was sworn in on October 24, 1951.

In 1953 supporters of the school system
regained control of the Council and appointed

#
ay

new members to the School Board. Throughout
the remainder of the decade, however, there
was a continuing battle as alternating groups
were elected. These political ups and downs had
a substantial effect on the schools, often delay-
ing needed improvements to the facilities.

Controversy arose once again in 1957 when
the Council rejected a School Board request
for a bond issue to expand the high school,
despite a petition signed by 1,200 residents
favoring the expansion. The Council went so
far as to replace the School Board members
who had recommended the bond issue. The
newly constituted School Board voted to elim-
inate 12 positions from the school staff and
proposed to house children in quonset huts
rather than planning for permanent buildings.
Once again public ire was aroused. At one
School Board meeting, more than 300 people
attended to show their concern for the
schools. On two other occasions, bond issues
appropriating money for the schools were
defeated or postponed as a result of court suits
brought by opponents of the system.

School System
Thrives

Despite difficulties, the school system contin-
ued to grow. In 1951 the enrollment in the city
schools was 1,151 students; in 1952, it was
1,357; in 1953 it was 1,528; and in 1955 it was
1,741. The peak enrollment was in 1965-66
when there were approximately 2,200 students
attending Falls Church schools.

Renovations and construction continued at
George Mason to accommodate enrollment
increases. A permanent football field, a track,

and tennis courts were added to George
Mason in the early 1960s. An addition in 1962
included the classrooms that later made up
part of the middle school, a small activity gym,
shower and locker rooms, and enlarged admin-
istration space and library.

In 1964 most classroom needs had been met
and city residents began discussions for a City
auditorium and a community center. The City
Council appointed a citizens’ committee to
study the city and school needs. This commit-
tee recommended the need for two buildings:
a theater-type auditorium at George Mason
and a community center near City Hall. An
auditorium had, in fact, been part of the plan
for a complete junior-senior high school facili-
ty from the first drawings in 1951. Since it also
was obvious that George Mason needed addi-
tional vocational facilities, the proposed solu-
tion was to make the vocational rooms a part
of the auditorium addition. The plan was
approved by the City Council, and in Novem-
ber 1966 a referendum to provide for bonds to
finance the addition passed overwhelmingly.
The auditorium and vocational classrooms
were dedicated on September 13, 1969. A li-

Falls Church Integrates Its Schools

After the United States Supreme Court ruled
against segregation in the public schools in
1954, a program of “massive resistance” took
place in Virginia. The State legislature passed a
law which would deny State aid to any public
school that placed black and white children in
the same classroom. Under the leadership of
Governor Lindsey Almond the legislation was
repealed in January of 1959.

Following the collapse of Virginia's “massive
resistance” program, Falls Church became the

first Virginia city to voluntarily integrate its
African-American children into the school sys-
tem. Prior to that time, tuition was paid by the
school system to send these elementary pupils
to James Lee Elementary School in Fairfax
County and high school students to the
regional high school in Manassas or a high
school in Washington, D.C. The School
Board's decision to integrate its schools in 1961
created for Falls Church a reputation for lead-
ership in education throughout the state.

The 1970s Spawn
Dramatic Changes

The Closing of Madison

By 1973-74 the enrollment was 1,800 students;
dropping to 1,039 in 1983-84 and today it is
approximately 1,500. The decrease in school
enrollment that occurred in the late 1970s can
be attributed to the Tyler Garden apartment
complex (now Winter Hill) converting to con-
dominiums. Another factor was the increase in
the cost of housing in the city, which discour-
aged families with children from moving into

the City.

Faced in the early 1970s with the continued

1964

decline in enrollment, a joint City Council-
School Board resolution was passed in April
1975 establishing a community task force on
school building needs. In July 1976, the task
force recommended that the city operate two,
rather than three, elementary schools, each
with a capacity of 350-to-400 students, and
each to be renovated.

Madison Elementary School was approaching
its 50th birthday and September 20, 1976 was
proclaimed “Madison School Day in the City
of Falls Church.” Madison was rededicated as a
community school, an act which recognized
the role of that school in serving the total pop-
ulation in areas of pre-school and child
resource centers, extended day care, senior cit-
izens’ programs, instruction in English as a
Second Language, and programs in adult edu-
cation. But after 50 years, Madison School was
in need of renovation.

On November 16, 1976, the School Board voted
to renovate Madison during the 1978-79 school
year in accordance with the recommendation of
the Facilities Task Force. The Task Force also
recommended that Thomas Jefferson be reno-
vated during the summer of 1977. Mt. Daniel
would be upgraded to house a slightly larger stu-

dent and staff population for the years of reno-
vation of Madison and Thomas Jefferson. By
1979-80, all students would be housed in the
two renovated schools, both actually in the city,
and Mt. Daniel would possibly be converted to
other uses.

Numerous public hearings were held on the
proposed renovations and the closing of one of
the elementary schools. Neighborhoods sur-
rounding each school fought hard to try to
save their school. Ultimately the School Board
made the difficult decision to close Madison
School in lieu of Mt. Daniel, as had been pre-
viously decided. Mt. Daniel was the newer of
the two schools and could serve the needs of
the city for more years than Madison. In addi-
tion, Thomas Jefferson was to be the only
school to undergo renovation at that time. In
May 1979, the School Board adopted a resolu-
tion to deed the Madison School property to
the City to be used for municipal purposes.
There were many suggestions for the use of the
building. However, it was deemed too costly
to maintain the building in a usable condition
and it was torn down in 1979.

In the fall of 1979, George Mason underwent a

$2 million renovation making it accessible for
disabled students with the addition of two ele-

1969-70

vators, a ramp to the auditorium area, and a
restroom. Energy conservation measures, in-
cluding a new heat and air conditioning sys-
tem, dropped ceilings, lowered window spaces,
and sound insulation were added, along with
new lighting. The middle school area was
changed to accommodate its new role.

Grade Patterns Reorganized: Loss of Neigh-
borhood Schools

The 1978-79 school year saw students from
Thomas Jefferson divided between Madison
School and Mt. Daniel School while the reno-
vation of Thomas Jefferson took place. The
sixth grade students were moved to George
Mason. Thomas Jefferson Elementary School
reopened in September 1979 with 16 classes
and approximately 340 students. Mt. Daniel
had three kindergarten and three first grade
classes with an enrollment of approximately
110 students.

With only two elementary schools remaining
in Falls Church, the School Board decided in
1979 to reorganize the grade patterns of all the
schools. Under the new plan, Mt. Daniel
Elementary School housed kindergarten and
first grade and Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School grades two through five. The sixth grade
remained at George Mason Junior/Senior High

School, and a middle school, a growing entity
in education, was created for grades six through
eight. This pattern of grade organization is still
in place today.

From 1980 to 1985, enrollments at Thomas
Jefferson declined to a low of 13 classes, how-
ever, by 1985 there was an increase to 14 class-
es. Today there are 21 classes with 448 stu-
dents. The enrollment at Mt. Daniel has also
increased over the past five years. Currently
there are five kindergarten and five first grade
classes.

Educational
Innovations

Falls Church has been an innovative educa-
tional community. In 1964, Falls Church began
offering kindergarten—prior to the availability
of state funding. Falls Church again led the
way when kindergarten became a full-day pro-
gram in 1973. And recognizing that many
mothers were working outside the home, Falls
Church started its extended day care program
in 1975, eight years prior to legislation autho-
rizing the same, to offer safe, affordable, qual-
ity child care to elementary students before
and after school.

Arlington Career Center

To more adequately provide for the needs of
students interested in vocational education,
the Falls Church School Board contracted with
neighboring Arlington County in 1981 to sup-
port a limited number of students to attend the
Arlington Career Center. The Career Center is
designed to serve as an extension of the pro-
gram at George Mason. It provides education-
al experiences in the areas of occupational
exploration, career preparation, and enrich-
ment to those students desiring to benefit from
a hands-on learning style. Students are assisted
in job placement upon successful completion
of their program.

George Mason the First High School in
Virginia to Offer the IB Program

On May 5, 1981, the International Baccalaure-
ate Program (IB) was approved by the School
Board. Falls Church was the first Virginia
school system to offer the rigorous program.
The IB is an internationally recognized pro-
gram of studies which is available to highly
motivated 11th and 12th graders at George
Mason. It requires community service, a senior
thesis, and academic courses in all subject
areas. Students take examinations in May
which are evaluated externally. Many colleges
and universities in the United States recognize
the diploma and/or the subject certificates

earned in partial fulfillment of the diploma.
These schools give course credit or advanced
standing to a student who earns a satisfactory
score on the IB exams.

George Mason High School was the site of the
Eleventh Annual International Baccalaureate
Heads of Schools Conference in 1988 with
representatives from 32 nations in attendance.

George Mason has one of the most open IB
programs in the world and it has become more
inclusive over the years with nearly 70 percent
of the juniors and seniors taking at least one IB
course. During the 1996-97 school year, 150
juniors and seniors participated in IB classes
and a remarkable 28 seniors received the pres-
tigious IB diploma in 1997. GM maintains one
of the best records nationwide, and it contin-
ues to expand offerings to meet the needs and
interests of a growing number of students in all
fields. In recent years the school has added IB
courses in theater arts, music and art/design,
and a science sequence that all help to main-

tain a balance consistent with the academic
rigor and quality of the program.

Jay Matthews, a nationally recognized educa-
tion reporter for The Washington Post, gave
George Mason the top ranking in the
Washington area for encouraging students to
take IB courses. Schools with a rating of 1,000
or higher are considered to be in the top 2 per-
cent in the country. George Mason scored
3,146. In a March 22, 1998 Washington Post
Magazine cover story Matthews wrote: “...more
high-level courses are offered to a larger slice of the stu-
dent body than at any other public school in the
Washington area.” "...in some ways it outshines every
other school I have ever visited.”

Special Education

Falls Church City Public Schools has had a
program for special education students since
the beginning of the school division in 1949.
In the early days special education identifica-
tion was not used as it is today. The teachers
taught “slow learners” or “special, ungraded

children.” At the elementary level there was a
younger ungraded class and an older one.
There was also a class at the secondary level.
The children who were placed with these
teachers had a multiple range of disabilities,
both physical and mental, as well as being
emotionally disturbed. The classes were kept
to about ten students, but there were no aides
to assist the teacher.

In the late 1960s a pilot program had the least
severely disabled children attend regular class-
es. The class sizes were quite large and there
was no support staff to assist the classroom
teacher. A regional Crisis Resource Center
model, originated at George Washington
University (GWU), introduced a new concept
to working with special children. The crisis
resource teacher would take the children out
of the classroom when they were not in con-
trol and attempt to allay their anxiety or dis-
ruptive behavior. Along with the in-school
program, there was a Crisis Resource Center
located on East Columbia Street manned by
GWU staff which attempted to teach tech-
niques to parents and teachers. The program
was not successful and was terminated in 1972.

George Mason,
/
Ma

There were no programs for the mentally re-
tarded children. There was a policy that stated
that “these children would not benefit from
education,” and therefore the students did not
“fit in." The school system supported the place-
ment of mentally retarded children into private
schools and the parents were tasked with find-
ing the placement. Families could ask for a
reimbursement of $1,500 from the school sys-
tem, but this amount usually did not totally
cover the tuition. To assist these parents many
co-operative, non-profit schools came into exis-
tence. If a child was designated “trainable,” the
school system did not offer reimbursement.
The State operated training centers, such as the
Northern Virginia Training Center, for the
trainable children. Other centers enrolled chil-
dren who had specific disabilities such as deaf-
ness or blindness.

In 1971, a family who had a trainable child

requested reimbursement from the school sys-
tem to send the student to a private placement.
Since it was not under the policy, the request
was denied. Superintendent Pace was concerned
about the fairness of the policy and lobbied
the School Board to amend it. So in 1972 the

program for educating learning disabled stu-
dents in pull-out classes in the schools began
to evolve. Tuition assistance for the more
severely disabled students continued, but the
payment was made directly to the private or
public school for full tuition, and the place-
ment was obtained by the school psychologist.

The Virginia General Assembly legislated a
bold action in 1974 by requiring all school sys-
tems to provide services for all special educa-
tion students. This action was a year ahead of
the federal law 94-142 which mandated special
education with annual individual educational

plans (IEPs) for all disabled children

A further development took place in 1975
which provided state funding for the hiring of
child development specialists who would iden-
tify special education pre-school children. The
specialist would conduct home instruction for
the parents and the children.

Beginning in 1989, a feasibility study was con-
ducted to determine the appropriateness of
providing services within the school system for
all special education students, eliminating the
majority of outplacements. Ten mentally
retarded students were identified as children
who could have a successful experience by
being in the regular school program. A stake-

holders committee of parents, administrators,
and regular and special education teachers was
formed to prepare for the transition. Additional
special education staff, both teachers and para-
professionals, was hired to implement the pro-
gram, and students with severe needs began
attending the schools in Falls Church in 1992-
93. Although there were many challenges to be
addressed, it was immediately apparent that the
students could be integrated into the main-
stream of the regular education classes with
benefits for all concerned.

In the years that ensued, the program which
was initially called the Inclusion Program has
become all inclusive as most special education
students spend 90 percent of the instructional
day in regular education classrooms. The stu-
dents are now an integral part of their schools
participating in extra-curricular clubs and activ-
ities. The Circle of Friends Club was estab-

lished to promote friendships with their peer
groups, and the results have been a widening of
awareness for all students.

Technology

A high priority for the school system is tech-
nological preparation and education for stu-
dents. The world of microcomputers was intro-
duced in all grades in 1982-83 with ten micro-
computers in the school system, Commodores
in the elementary grades and Black Apple IIs in
the high school. Technology was primarily
funded from grocery receipt programs, and
some teachers who opted to allocate money
from elsewhere in their budget. During the
early and mid-1980s, a full-time technology
resource position was funded at the elementary
level and a new position, curriculum coordina-
tor, was created at the middle and high school
with one of the responsibilities being technolo-
gy. Computers were integrated into the cur-

riculum at all levels by those teachers who were
enthusiastic about embracing technology. It
was a grass roots effort.

Toward the end of the decade, the equipment
became obsolete and there was a concentrated
effort to integrate DOS stand-alone machines.
The technology had to mirror the larger world
that was, by this time, 85 percent IBM com-
patible.

In June 1994, a K-12 Technology Task Force
was appointed to develop a comprehensive
technology plan. After lengthy examination and
research, the completed proposal was submit-
ted to the state for review and received notice
from the Virginia Department of Education
that it had been cited as “exemplary.”

A $20,000 donation from the Business In
Education Partnership, generous donations
from the PTAs in all schools, and business con-
tributions helped to get the plan underway.
Most of the teachers in all grades had embraced
and adopted technology. All three schools were
set up on a Local Area Network (LAN) con-
necting every classroom and providing them
with access to the Internet through the LAN.
Every classroom also has at least one computer
workstation to serve instructional, research,
and administrative needs.

In December 1997 a website was launched for
the middle and high schools that contains,
among other items, maps, an interactive calen-
dar, and synopsis of current and pending stu-
dent technology projects.

Future plans call for the creation of a Wide Area
Network (WAN) connecting all school and city
facilities and the installation of a new tele-
phone/voice communications system so that
Falls Church will become a true “electronic vil-
lage.” This will increase communication and
collaboration among students, teachers, and
parents both inside and outside our community.

The school system renewed its commitment to
providing quality professional and curriculum
development for staff members. Technology
training sessions are held for teachers and time
is allowed for instructional collaboration with
colleagues. Training continues throughout the
summer months. Falls Church City school stu-
dents and staff will cross the bridge to the new
century fully prepared.

Local and State Alliances

Falls Church schools have not only internation-
al partners but are fortunate to have two associ-
ations on the local scene. The Business In
Education Partnership (BIE) has successfully
linked our schools and local businesses for
almost 15 years. Through initiatives of the BIE,
new programs have been added. These include
expanded career education, internships, tutor-
ing, and a speakers bureau. In addition, a career
shadowing program for eighth grade students
and a career day for seventh graders allows stu-

dents to meet and work with professionals in
various occupations. The BIE Partnership con-
tinuously supports the school system by provid-
ing annual grants to enhance programs. Over
$100,000 in resources has been given to the
schools. Each year over 150 people are involved
with the students through various programs.

The Northern Virginia Center for Virginia Tech/
University of Virginia also provides interaction
with the schools, particularly at the middle
school and high school levels. Computer wiring

May 1998, Falls Church City Public Schools
announced a new partnership with Virginia Tech
University to create a Technology Learning
Center. Virginia Tech is providing funds for
design and construction and George Mason
Middle/High school is providing facilities and
computers. The Technology Learning Center is
available to the school system during the day
and to Virginia Tech in the evenings and on
weekends. George Mason High School students
can access the center to take advanced or spe-
cialized courses as well as communicate with
students in schools around the world. Existing

By the early '90s, George Mason as a facility
was in great need of upgrading and moderniza-
tion in order to meet the educational goals for
6-12th grade students. Since GM opened in
1952, the state and federal governments had
mandated new programs that required addi-
tional space. These included special education
at all grade levels, gifted and talented at all
grade levels, English as a Second language at all
levels, Title IX equal athletic opportunities for
both boys and girls, Family Life and Health for
grades 6-10, computer labs to support comput-
er education, and guidance/career center space.

On February 11, 1991, the City Council passed
a resolution setting a bond referendum sched-
uled for June 4 for the George Mason Middle/
High School (GM) renovation project. Council
action followed two years of study by x archi-
tectural advisory committee and unanimous
approval of the resulting project by the Planning
Commission and School Board. The referendum
passed overwhelmingly, and the ground break-
ing ceremony took place April 2, 1993.

The renovation project created adequate space
for state and federal government mandated
programs as well as provided new learning
areas to accommodate a projected increase in
enrollment. The building was also reconfigured
to provide a more centrally located, separate
and identifiable middle school that would bet-
ter address the unique learning and socializa-
tion needs of the 11-14 year-old student. And
the gymnasium addition met increased needs
for physical education space.

New construction included middle school expan-
sion, high school science laboratories, an auxil-
iary gym, dining room and kitchen and bath-
rooms. Modernization was made with a new
roof, existing gym and locker room improve-
ments, renovation of existing facilities, asbestos
removal, auditorium improvements, and win-
dow/exterior improvements. Additional site and
safety/security improvements were also made.

GM also houses important community assets,
such as its only auditorium, a media center,
the Community Education offices and pro-
grams, and the Channel 38 television studio.
The renovation project included upgrading all
of these areas.

SUPERINTENDENTS

Dear Editor:

My tenure as Superintendent of Falls Church
Public Schools from April 1, 1971 through '
September 30, 1991 was an exciting and satis-
fying time of my 43-year career in education.
Satisfaction in one's career is often achieved
through accomplishments in the position.
With the leadership and assistance of School
Boards, City Councils, citizens of Falls
Church, city managers, principals, teachers,
Warren J. Pace school and city staff members and students,
1971-1991 many changes and programs occurred during

this time.

Irvin H. Schmitt
4949-1965

Today the Falls Church City Public Schools
Dwight E. Knox have a superior reputation, nationally and inter-
1965-1971 nationally, and people desire to locate in the
City for its excellent schools. From the incep-
tion of Falls Church City having its own
schools, achieving excellence has been its
desired goal, and this has permeated through-
out its years of existence. With this promise
though, the 1970s proved to be a time of test-
ing whether or not the City would continue to
have its own schools. | remember vividly being
asked “Will Falls Church continue as a separate
school division?” The enrollment had decreased
to near 1,000, there were three K-6 elementary
schools with many combination grade classes,

34

Patricia Dignan and the per-pupil cost was near the highest in
1995-1997 the area. My answer to the question was an
emphatic yes, but there must be good reasons

a for our system to remain independent. The

Stewart D.  .
Roberson d schools must be different and provide better
1991-1995 opportunities for our children and citizens of

Falls Church than surrounding school divisions.

Now, | would like to summarize some of the
Mary Ellen Shaw changes and progress that occurred to make

1997-present



=== Page 37 ===

Falls Church unique in its educational quality
during my years as Superintendent:

1) Full-day kindergarten with a standard class
size of 20 students taught by one teacher and
one paraprofessional

2) Community Education programs and publi-
cations utilizing Mott Foundation funds as
seed money

3) Before and after-school day care programs
under the auspices of Community Education
4) Renovation of Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School with the addition of the community
gymnasium. This project was completed in
1979 as the first major facilities improvement
following a task force study chaired by
Elizabeth Blystone

5) Changing the grade level organization from
K-6 and 7-12 to K-1; 2-5; 6-8; and 9-12 when
Thomas Jefferson reopened and Madison
Elementary School was closed. This change
included the official designation of the George
Mason Middle School for grades 6, 7, and 8
with its own principal. The change of grades
for Mt. Daniel to K-1 and Thomas Jefferson to
2-5 meant all students in the City of a given
grade attended the same school, which unified
the community following the controversy of
closing an elementary school. Further, the
larger numbers of students per grade eliminat-
ed most combination grade classes.

6) Instituting the International Baccalaureate
Program at George Mason High School in
1981. This program elevated standards of
instruction and brought national and interna-
tional prestige to the school system.

7) Expansion of career and vocational offerings
at George Mason High School through an
agreement with Arlington County for students
to enroll in classes at the Arlington Career
Center.

8) In 1983 George Mason Junior-Senior High
School was recognized by the United States
Department of Education as one of the best
high schools in the nation. When the
Department of Education expanded such
recognition to elementary schools, both
Thomas Jefferson and Mt. Daniel received
similar honors. School officials were presented
with plaques at the White House and congrat-
ulated by the President of the United States.
9) Mt. Daniel Elementary School was renovat-
ed and redesigned as a facility for early child-
hood education, especially for kindergarten
and first grade.

10) Adoption of policies and regulations
requiring excellence in curriculum offerings for
all students, i.e. special education, gifted and
talented. The Curriculum Council, composed
of representative teachers, administrators, and
parents, was organized in the 1970s to make
recommendations to the Superintendent and
School Board for curriculum changes. This was
later incorporated into a policy and regulation.
11) Planning and implementing a Family Life
and Sex Education program as desired by the
citizens of Falls Church prior to a state man-
date.

12) Successful Bond Referendums in 1991 for
renovations and additions to George Mason

High and Middle Schools.

I thank the citizens of Falls Church City, espe-
cially the dedicated School Board members
and other officials, all school staff members,
and students for helping to make my tenure as
Superintendent of Schools an outstanding and
rewarding part of my career. | continue to have
interest and take pride in the excellent Falls

Church City Public Schools.

Warren J. Pace
Superintendent, 1971-1991

Dear Editor:

Thanks for the opportunity to share some of
my reflections on the school system as it pre-
pares to celebrate the rich history it has
enjoyed over the past 50 years. Obviously, my
memories are not as lengthy as some others.

Upon my arrival as superintendent in August
1991, I had the great fortune of following a
gentleman known today as the Superintendent
Emeritus of Falls Church City Public Schools,
Dr. Warren J. Pace. Dr. Pace fostered a high
level of stability and dignity in the position and
in his fine work with the School Board and
community. I derived much inspiration and
counsel from his sterling example as this thirty-
five year old was attracted to a school district of
such fine quality.

A number of factors were at work in 1991
which contributed to more changes beyond
the superintendency, changes which would
extend across the City and its school system.
The City's political parties were engaged in
competition which resulted in close majorities
on a variety of key decisions, some of which
had direct influence on the schools. For
instance, three new School

Board members could

trace their appointments directly to the new
majority which was formed in September
1991, just days after the new superintendent
took office.

By the end of the 1991-92 school year, each of
the school system's four schools had new prin-
cipals at the helm when compared to the
beginning of the previous school year. By this
same time, nine of the ten administrative posi-
tions in the school system were held by indi-
viduals new to their roles or by individuals
with realigned job responsibilities and titles.

Plans were being realized for the renovation or
additions to the school facilities at three of the
four schools. Economic pressures brought on by
the recession and these capital needs created a
set of conditions within which the school bud-
get could experience little expansion, necessi-
tating the reorganization of some services.

Despite these changes and the “natural forces"
which caused them, there was a strongly held
belief that the mission and character of the
schools should be “preserved and enhanced".
This was a theme which I discerned quite read-
ily following the develop-

ment of my “immersion

report’—the document developed after spend-
ing several weeks in individual conferences and
interviews with key stakeholders about the
strengths and challenges of the school system.

From the Immersion Report and subsequent
School Board leadership, a number of agendas
developed which preserved and enhanced the
school district. Among the new fronts on
which we moved together were the following:

#@ The formation of a Leadership Team, com-
prised of all administrators in the school district
e¢ The implementation of the “inclusion pro-
gram"

ee The development of a Strategic Planning
Community Team which produced a five-year
school community plan of action

ee The establishment of George Mason
Middle School as a distinct instructional and
administrative level with reporting responsibil-
ities directly to the Superintendent

e? The development of a revised Student Code
of Conduct

*¢ The establishment of the Technology Task
Force, the Special Education Task Force, and
the Salary Study Task Force, each of which
brought about significant new directions for
the instructional program and school district
employees

*¢ The development of a process of curricu-

lum revision for each subject area in the school
system

*¢ The development of a strong commitment
to the value of professional development as the
key to substantive and positive change; repre-
sented most clearly through the intensive train-
ing featured for new curricular initiatives and
through the Enhancing Teaching and Learning
professional development framework

e> The establishment of an international part-
nership with the American Independent School
of Bolivia

e¢ The reorganization of the district's central
fiscal services, involving stakeholders in the
formation of district fiscal policies

e¢ The preservation of a record as the top per-
forming one in the metro area and within the
Commonwealth on measures of student achieve-
ment

*> The development of a strong and successful
response to the Request For Proposals generated
by the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech
as they sought a new joint location; School
Board members and key School and City senior
staff worked tirelessly to attract the Northern
Virginia Center to Falls Church as a substantive
and symbolic means of preserving the communi-

ty's image as Education City, USA

In 1984 the issue of elected school boards
started gaining momentum in Virginia. At that
time, Virginia was the only state in the US.
that had no elected school boards. Virginia
had elected school boards in earlier years but
had abandoned them because of the integra-
tion issue. By state law, members were appoint-
ed. Two selection methods were used: in 53
counties and all cities, school board members
were appointed by supervisors or City
Councils; in the remaining 42 counties circuit
court judges named selection committees
which appointed board members. In Northern
Virginia, the support for elected boards was
stronger than elsewhere throughout the state,
but it was not public support that was at issue.
It was legislative action. A hearing was held in
Northern Virginia in November 1984 to dis-
cuss pending action by the General Assembly.
Debate took place, but no bill was passed.

Five years later, in 1989, the topic of elected
school boards reached the floor of the Virginia
House of Delegates. After a public hearing, the
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections
defeated the legislation. Falls Church had sup-

ported the proposal provided school boards
have their own taxing powers.

In 1992 the state legislature passed the
Brickley Bill granting local jurisdictions the
option of determining if they wanted to elect
or continue to have appointed school boards.
By early 1993 a petition drive was underway to
have an elected school board in Falls Church.
The drive was successful and in November
1993 City voters went to the polls.

There was moderate voter turnout, but 62 per-
cent of the voters approved elected school
boards. While substantial, this approval rating
was the lowest of the five Northern Virginia
jurisdictions which had the question on the
ballot. In Falls Church City, School Board

members would now be elected at the same



=== Page 43 ===

time as the City Council, and the terms would
b also be the same.

In May 1994, Falls Church's first elected
e School Board members were Sally Ekfelt,
Janice Eklund, Yvette Eldridge and Hal
Lippman. Two years later, May 1996, was the
first contested School Board election in the
City; five candidates ran for three seats. Voters
selected Jason Douglas, John Durham and
Rosemarie Hunziker. On July 1, 1996, for the
first time, the entire School Board was elected

in Falls Church.

Since the Falls Church City Public Schools
began its operation in 1949, approximately
1,100 teachers and administrators have served
City children. As part of the legal agreement
with Fairfax County that brought about the
independent school system, 35 teachers’ con-
tracts were transferred from the County to the
City. The letter of agreement signed by Helen
Regan, Falls Church School Board
Chair, and J.W. Robinson, Fairfax
County School Board Chair, had to
have the approval of the teacher to
accept the teaching assignment in
the newly formed school division.
The new elementary faculty taught
at Madison and the Jefferson
: - Institute. Secondary students con-
ell tinued to attend county schools.

During the early years there was a
great deal of staff turnover. In the
covenants of the contract there was a statement
that the contract would be terminated when a
woman was four months pregnant. The files
indicate that many young teachers left their
positions with few years of experience due to
pregnancy. This language remained until 1970
when it was softened to state that the teacher
could go on unpaid sick leave. After 1974 there
was no further reference. With the Family and
Medical Leave Act of today, both parents are
eligible to take family leave with the birth or
adoption of a child thus providing for greater
continuity of career staff members.

Many teachers in the 1950s had attended nor-
mal school and did not have a college degree.
When Dr. Knox served as the Superintendent,
all non-degreed teachers were given a deadline
in which to receive their diplomas. There was
an exodus of older teachers who were unable to

comply.

Through the decades the requirements for
teacher certification and licensure have
improved drastically. Currently there are 143
teachers employed in Falls Church; 112 have
their master's degrees. Staff development and
keeping current in the ever-changing methods
of teaching are given special emphasis.

During the years of Dr. Pace's superintendency
the staff was very stable. In some years few, if
any, teachers relocated or left the profession. In
recent years many long-tenured faculty have
retired and younger staff have been hired.
There is greater mobility today, and the
turnover remains high as teachers leave for a
variety of reasons. However there is a cadre of
teachers who have been in Falls Church for fif-
teen or more years who are not near retirement
and are providing valuable leadership.

The following staff members served or are con-
tinuing to serve the school system for 25 or
more years: Marge Albert, Greg Alexiou, Jenna
Atkins, Nancy Birindelli, Nancy Brown, Jerry
Bruns, Ruth Busbee, Carol Cofey, Nell Cooper,
Louise Costa, Alva Cottini, Milt Davis, Nancy

Education and methods have also exhibited
many changes through the years. The days of
students sitting in rows with the teacher lectur-
ing at the front of the room are long gone. The
students of today are engaged in a variety of
subject areas and are taught by specialists in
their field. At the elementary school these disci-
plines include physical education, music, art,

reading, computer technology, gifted educa-
tion, guidance, and English as a Second
Language. There is much more teaming
through the grades as teachers “co-teach" to
accommodate different student learning styles
and to differentiate instruction.

The area of special education is one which has
experienced tremendous growth in recent years.
Since Falls Church was so small, most seriously
disabled and mentally retarded children were
sent to out-placement locations that could best
provide services. Several years ago these chil-
dren began attending the schools in a program
of inclusion where all students attend class
together. This program has necessitated an
enormous expansion of the special education
staff to include teachers, transition specialists to
assist the students with work experiences, and
paraprofessional staff to work one-on-one with
some children.

Generally, school staff has widened its scope to
encompass additional support personnel. In
Falls Church today, each kindergarten class has
a full-time teacher and a full-time paraprofes-
sional. In first grade the paras are in the class-
room for half the day. The ratio of adults to stu-
dents is very low which accounts for the high
rate of success and low dropout rate as children
cannot become “lost”. Aides have replaced
teachers on the playground and on bus duty. All
teachers now have a duty-free lunch and plan-
ning periods.

Teachers have long been advocates for their own
salary and benefits. In 1959 Superintendent
Schmitt acknowledged in the personnel files of
52 teachers that each had signed a petition in a

salary dispute. In the mid-1980s, the faculty
voted no confidence in the Superintendent and
the School Board over monetary issues. Today
there are two employee advisory groups—one
for professional staff (PEAC) and one for sup-
port staff (SEAC) which make recommenda-
tions to the Superintendent and the School
Board regarding salary, benefits and policy
involving personnel and working conditions.

Several teachers have died while still employed.
Some of the most notable include a popular
math teacher, William Snodgrass, who was acci-
dentally shot and killed by his friend, the Falls
Church police chief, while demonstrating how
to apprehend a thief as they had lunch at the
Falls Church Drug Store in 1957. John Lund,
elementary PE teacher and favorite coach,
drowned while vacationing in Florida. Fatal car
accidents took the lives of Mary Lee Tatum and
Karla Strickland—two teachers greatly beloved
by their students.

The School Board office has relocated several
times since 1949. The first office was at 1057
West Broad Street. The longest tenure was
“above the florist” at 419 West Broad.

For a short time, when enrollments a

43

Nancy

were low and space permitted, the
office was at Mt. Daniel. Three recent

Sprague

moves included 210 East Broad, 301
North Washington and currently 803

West Broad. The School Board meet-

ings were held “above the florist”, then
at Mt. Daniel and now in the Council
Chambers at City Hall where they are

televised live on Channel 38.

Dear Editor:

From 1964 to 1984 I taught French and sometimes
German and Latin at George Mason. I also worked with
the French Club and the French Honor Society. | remem-
ber most my first two years when I met a fine group of
juniors and seniors. They learned somehow and | did also.
The classes took trips to the National Art Gallery, staged a
French poetry competition, many international dinners,
and a concert by a French pianist. | don't do justice to all
the other events, but they were memorable.

THE EDIT

Dear Editor:
I always said the Falls Church school system inher-
ited me rather than getting me by choice. | was
teaching in Madison School when Falls Church
became a city. How thankful I am that the bulk of
my teaching years were with the city school sys-
tem. My twenty-six years there were happy years.
My six-and-seven year old pupils were a delight,
so innocent and honest. One memory that I have
really enjoyed came from a precious little Greek
boy. "You know Miss Worsham, you wouldn't look
so much like an old lady if you didn't have such
white hair!"

Isla Worsham

I was a freshman the first year George Mason Junior/Senior High School opened.
When we started the new school year, classes were held in every part of the new
building since many of the classrooms were not finished. Sometimes there were
eight different classes on the gymnasium floor at one time. Paper was taped to the
gym floor to protect it and was then removed for the basketball games. I also
attended classes in the teachers’ lounge and the main hallway. Most of the stu-
dents from my class had previously attended classes in the old Jefferson School on
North Cherry Street and saw the new George Mason building as a new modern
high school building. Soon we were into the regular routine of high school life at

our new high school on West Broad Street.

John Reimers, Class of 1956

Dear Editor:

The school bell on Monday was never a problem for me. | enjoyed the student
body and personnel of George Mason Junior/Senior High School. It was my
pleasure to teach where | found so much support from the administrators, par-

ents and students.

I must add that the science labs never lacked for supplies or equipment that
the curriculum required. I have toured college laboratories that were not as fully
equipped. Of course, there was one time | had to use a drastic measure to point
up the need for an air conditioner for the chemical supply room. We fried two
eggs on the over-heated floor and it was recorded by the Mustang photogra-
phers. It was amazing how fast the room was air conditioned.

Many of my former students keep in touch. They live enriched lives and are
located in all areas of the U.S. and even abroad.

Dear Editor:
I started teaching as a substitute at Madison School in 1954 and
became a full-time teacher in January 1955. The next school year I
taught at Thomas Jefferson when it first became a part of the Falls
Church school system. | taught third grade for a few years and then
changed to second grade. In June of 1974 I retired.

During these years | saw many changes. I had wonderful students,
great parents and met many terrific teachers. The Falls Church School
System has always been a great one and | am very proud to have been

a part of it.

I loved working with the children;
the staff was superb. I am quite proud

Falls Church, Virginia!

) Dear Editor:
It took all the creativity that “Coach” Joe Crain and I could muster in 1951-52.

| We were to teach Physical Education to the junior and senior high students, but

| we had no gym and very little sports equipment. In inclement weather we could
seldom use a classroom, either. Joe and I made up all sorts of activities, even
building snow figures in the winter. The students could not have had better atti-
tudes, though.

If I were told I had to erase all but one year of teaching from memory, that

first year, using Jefferson Elementary playground and the small, rutted fields at
Thompson House would be my keeper. Not only were the students great, but the
parents were fully supportive and the camaraderie among the faculty was terrific!

Dear Editor:

One of Mr. Irvin Schmitt's desired
goals before he retired as
Superintendent of the Falls Church
schools was to hire a speech and lan-
guage pathologist. During the inter-
view he looked very familiar to me;
and what I said rang a lot of bells
with him; so when we got back to our
respective homes, we checked the
Davenport, lowa's high school year-
book. To our pleasant surprise we dis-
covered he was Superintendent of
Schools in Davenport when | went to
school there. As a matter of fact, he
handed me my diploma when | gradu-
ated from high school. Many years
and many miles later he handed me
my contract in 1965 to fulfill the role
of speech and language pathologist in
the Falls Church schools.

Carol Cofey

Dear Editor:

When I began teaching at GM in 1967, it was an exciting time.
There were lots of new young teachers, some like myself just fresh
from the Peace Corps. Enrollment was growing. There was lots of
experimentation—both in education and in life style choice. In
English we tried innovative mini-courses, which were featured on
a D.C. television station. Sports teams were caught between the
traditional rigorous discipline and the new individualism. At one
point there were much better athletes walking around the halls in
their long hair and beards than there were on our sports teams.
Football, the ultimate establishment sport, was especially hard hit,
with only about 15 kids who were willing to play.

The '70s brought more stability, more seriousness in education
and leveling off and even falling enrollment. In 1975 | started the
first adult education program, which a year later grew into
Community Education. As was the custom, in Falls Church there
was plenty of input and help from the citizens. The School Board
and City Council recognized that with falling enrollments we
needed to open up the schools to all citizens, not just parents of
school aged children. We developed programs for pre-school,
working parents, consumers, dropouts and senior citizens. Falls
Church City Public Schools began to provide for the community
what it had always provided for its students—high quality educa-

tional opportunities in a wide variety of areas.
Bob Smiles

Dear Editor:

My classmates at Mt. Daniel and | were part of the future George Mason High
School class of 1965, the crest of the WWII baby-boomers, and the largest class to
ever traverse the hallowed halls of GM. That distinction, however, certainly had a
downside for many of us.

Because of our size and a concomitant lack of classroom space at George Mason,
the future GM class of 1965 from Mt. Daniel, Thomas Jefferson (TJ), and Madison
Elementary Schools were to be isolated as a group within the confines of the third
floor of TJ to spend our first year of high school at an elementary school!

I can still remember the overwhelming disappointment that we all felt as a result
of that decision. As seventh graders, we would not be taking part in all the things
that we had associated with high school, such as football games (even as puny
sixth graders we had heard about the legends that had been part of GM football in
the '50s — Coach Crain, John Tasker, Ray Peterson, Lance Seidel, and even some
young kid named Carlo), school dances, changing classes, going to Topps, pep
rallies, sock hops, shop classes, wearing a George Mason High School jacket, and
even being kicked around by the dreaded upperclassmen. All of those dreams
| seemed like a very distant and future experience for our class.
| believe the physical constraints of the third floor at TJ that forced all of us
together into six adjacent classrooms helped unite us as a group. The students from
three separate elementary schools were now located together and we quickly
began to identify ourselves as the class of '65. Many of us developed friendships
during that time that have lasted throughout the past 40 years.

Scott Sager, Class of 1965

Dear Editor:
I have many fond memories of the friends and
teachers who passed through GM in the early
1960s. Unfortunately, | never fully appreciated the
tireless efforts of the many excellent teachers who
provided all of us with a sound educational basis
for future life. A special thanks to the teachers and
coaches that I never had a chance to thank. | hope
my son Jimmy, GM class of ‘99, will express his
gratitude to the teachers that have had such a pos-
itive influence on his young life sooner than his
father did!

Bill Laing, Class of 1963

Dear Editor:

In 1967 the marching band was headed to Winchester, Virginia,
to compete in the annual Apple Blossom Festival Parade. We
loaded everything in the school bus, or at least thought we did,
and headed toward Winchester. About half way there someone
noticed that we did not bring the bass drum. We immediately
pulled over and the band director, Mr. Frank Barr, called back to
the school to see if anyone would drive all the way to Winchester
to bring the drum. We thought the chances were slim.

We arrived in Winchester and started marching in the parade
without the drum. It is hard to march in step without that drum
beating out the cadence. Our bass drummer, Rick Sebastian, the
biggest guy in the band, marched playing the gazoo. What a
sight. The parade route winded through the roads of Winchester
for about two miles. It would be extremely hard to find us. When
we were about a quarter mile from the reviewing stand, Mary
McCarthy appeared from nowhere carrying the bass drum. What
a miracle. We stopped so that Rick could put the drum on, hold-
ing up the parade in the process. We were so thrilled at what
happened and the crowd actually starting cheering for us. We
marched on and finished the parade, by then everyone in the
crowd knew what had happened. Our precision marching won us

§ first place in the parade. Later we were shown a tape of our
marching. Our rank and files where perfect. The miracle that
somebody actually hauled that drum to Winchester and found us
resulted in our first place achievement.

A VIRGINIA VILLAGE REVISITED

BJ,
Bradley E. Gernand
and Nave Netberton

I

Falls Church: A virgivia Vi[hge Revisited

presents in words and pictures the roots and
branches of the history of a closely knit V:r-;n:a

community.

Buffalo trails and Indian paths had been

established and land grants and patents were

taken  up by English col ` '-:n+a   Tt  iQ a cherished

local tradition that a log cabin woo .

large chimneys on one of which a stone was

inscribed "1699." This is the date the Falls

Church community traditionally accepts for its

first settlement. A few years later, the Truro Parish

vestry directed that an Anglican church be built
"at the cross roads near Michael Rcagan's," in

1733. This was the important center for a hamlet

which became the postal village of Falls Church

in  1849, a chartered town of the same name in

1875  and a city of the second class in  1948.

The wooden structure of the first church

"near the falls" was completed in  1734 and was

replaced by a sturdy brick building in  1769, both

named "The Falls Church" after an important

geographical feature nearby, the Little Falls of the
Potomac River. Church vestrymen of different

times included prominent people like Augustine

Washington, George Mason, William Fairfax and

George Washington.

When war with Great Britain became

inevitable in  1776, recruiting was done at The

Falls Church for men to fight in the American

Revolution for independence from the mother

country. Old tobacco rolling roads became useful

for transporting corn, wheat and other crops for

export from the international port of Alexandria.

Turnpikes, canals, the Alexandria, Loudoun 8c

Hampshire Railroad and later electric trolleys

were built to provide better means of transporta-

tion.

Telegraph and telephone lines were strung to

improve communications.

The War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish

American War and World Wars I and 11 each had

specific impacts on the small community which

are herein described. Some of the personal letters

quoted have not been previously published.

Everyday life and the resourceful ways in

which civic-minded and well-motivated residents

coped with ever-present problems make for

informative and sometimes amusing reading.

Through text, captions and more than 275

pictures, some in color and many never before

published, a large portrait of people, places,
events and things is painted. The book's narrative

reveals the community's long-standing major con-

cern about providing good schools for the chil-

drcn of the village. Political and racial issues are

presented as well as subjects such as businesses,
community activities, religion, recreation, parks

and historic preservation.

Foreword

e are standing at a crossroads in time and in history. We give thanks
tr living in a peaceful, free, and prosperous City. We know that it
Les everyone to make a little City such as Falls Church work-there
are no divisions between the government, the people, and business-we are
all part of the same civic ecosystem. It works because we work together to
make it work.

:`:`;

The "we" are our citizens-all of us-men and women of many races,
nationalities and religions. The "we" are their elected, employed, and volunteer

civil servants. The "we" are our businesses who not only serve their customers
but who also freely put so much back into our community. The "we" are the

people about whom this book is written.

In Falls Church at the threshold of the new millennium, we celebrate a

particularly rich heritage. Native Americans roamed the area, followed by
European settlers who moved here in  1699 and were the outermost edge of
Western civilization.  Soon they built The Falls Church. Later, troops marched
through here on Braddock's Expedition.

Our local leaders, including George Washington and George Mason, made

a revolution and established the framework for the most free nation on earth.
One of the corner stones-the Declaration of Independence-was first read in
the area at The Falls Church. And it was to here that the leaders of the country
fled when invaders occupied Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.

Later, the great commanders of the Civil War were here, as were thousands

of Federal and Confederate troops who moved through or were based in Falls
Church and in the forts on the surrounding hills.  During the Spanish-
American War we were again a major base of operations.

Some of our local citizens were leaders in the fight for equal rights early in

this century. During World War 11, Dwight Eisenhower lived here as he

planned the war effort. Before and since, our veterans and public servants have
sacrificed to carry on this heritage. The story of these events told in this book is
not just the history of Falls Church but of America.

Now, we are part of the most diverse, educated, economically successful,

technologically advanced, compassionate, free and influential region in the
world. That is a lot to celebrate and a lot to dedicate ourselves to maintaining
in the future. This book will help us do both.

City of Falls Church

Church resident. But our mirror may also be said to begin much earlier,
with Captain John Smith's map of the Potomac River basin of 1608.
A glance at Smith's map reveals a world much different from our own in
which a different civilization, with different villages, towns, and place names
occupied our region.

Pictures never lie, goes the old saying, but they alone do not illustrate

history. Falls Church is uniquely blessed to have excellent cartographic cover-

age, and we have included several of the most useful maps here.  Gifted artists
with brush and pen have created depictions of people, places, and local events
especially prior to the advent of photography. Selections from such works
are included.

Falls Church's photographic history reflects that of the medium. Early
Falls Church inhabitants appear grim: limited technology required lengthy

exposures in which the subjects remained absolutely still.  Smiles were difflcult
to hold and teeth were often unsightly (smiling in photographs is a twentieth-
century convention).

Indoor photos became common in Falls Church after the invention of
magnesium flash lighting in  1878.  George Eastman revolutionized photogra-

phy in  1888 by marketing his Kodak camera, which made "snapshots," or
casual photography, the realm of the common man. Photography in Falls
Church grew by leaps and bounds after this date.

Maurice Terman, chair, and members also provided guidance when requested
by the authors.

Tricentennial Committee Chair Ben Birindelli and committee members
were encouraging to the authors and asked good questions which led to helpful
research and answers. Many answers came from the Virginia Room staffs at
Fairfax and Arlington Public Libraries. Staff of the Local History Room of the
Mary RIley Styles Public Library of Falls Church also remained cheerful, will-
ing, and resourceful in repeated searches for different reference materials and

graphics. Janet Daeger-Warden, Beverly Rausch, and Brenda Crowley are pleas-
ant people with whom to work. Deane Dierksen, former library director, gave
the authors the beneflt of her knowledge, loan of computers, and constructive
comments after a careful reading of the manuscript draft. Additional readers
included Benson and Nancy Birindelli, Janet Daeger-Warden, Carol DeLong,

Jane Dexter, David Eckert, Edna Frady, Edwin Henderson 11, John Maier,
Diane Morse, Ross Netherton, David Snyder, Maurice Terman, Keith
Thurston, Adelaide Wang, and Harry Wells.

When a pictorial publication is involved, good photographs are a vital part

of the plan and in addition to the fine professional work of william Edmund
Barrett and Quentin Porter and the extensive Falls Church library photo collec-
tion, we had help from Barry Buschow, Dr. Frank D'Aquila, Maureen Budetti,
Howard Herman, John Maier, Scott Boatright, and many others whose credits
are shown with their photos. Tony Chaves supplied some early Falls Church
images from his extensive postcard collection.

City staff members who assisted us in various ways were City Attorney Roy

8. Thorpe, Jr., City Clerks Elizabeth-Anne Shawen and Kathleen Buschow,
Environmental Services Manager Son H. Nguyen, former City Manager Harry
E. Wells, Patsy Mitchell, staff, Falls Church Post Office; and Communications
Director Sheila Graham assisted with their specialties.

Many writing projects would not be successfully completed without the

people who take care of the all-important mechanics of getting through the
publication process.  Bernie Walton was the representative for publisher
Donning in Virginia Beach and worked as coordinator of the project with the
authors and the Tricentennial Committee in Falls Church. Matthew 8.
Gilmore and Margaretha Backers-Netherton did yeoman service assisting with
the proofreading of thousands of words. Carol and David Dunlap did much of
the preparation of the computer disks for splicing the different parts of the
work together. Finally to RIchard Colvin for his help with the indexing.

Introduction

ty of Falls Church, those exploring its history must first understand those
forming elements.

Falls Church is located in the Northern Virginia Piedmont region. The
underlying intensely folded rocks of the area were formed over 500 million

years ago. They were forcibly intruded by molten rock between 250400 mil-
lion years ago. The ground level was later uplifted and then eroded by wind
and water when Falls Church was a flat alluvial terrace under a wide, shallow
river draining from the western mountain range. River rock was deposited on
the ground that is now between 400-450 feet above sea level.  Following the
demise of the river, continued erosion formed winding, narrow, flat-bottomed
valleys, punctuated by river rock and gravel-capped hills. These hills and valleys
continue to exist today. Until recent decades, these valleys were referred to as
"hollows."

Two main streams, Tripps Run and Four Mile Run, have spring-fed sources

just outside of the City of Falls Church boundaries. The streams flow toward
the southeast into the Potomac River. They are separated by a ridge that rises
to 350450 feet above sea level, extending from Mount Daniel to Taylor Hill.
Tripps Run is bordered by a second higher ridge, to the southwest locally
known as Prout Hill, and also known as "Horseshoe Hill."

By the end of the Ice Age, this attractive landscape was characterized by
deep weathering and fertile black soil covered by game-rich forests and flsh-

filled streams.1

While there is little left in Falls Church to remind us of the game-rich for-
est and fish-filled streams, a very small woods on Taylor Hill next to Oakwood
Cemetery at Seven Corners prevails. The woods provide a diversity of natural-
ly-occurring native Virginia trees, shrubs, and vines, growing in soil undis-
turbed for over  140 years. The central portion of the woods is the last undis-
turbed area in Falls Church that has not been infested by exotic, invasive plants
which crowd out the native understory plants critical to the survival of our
native songbirds, butterflies, and other wildlife that have evolved in this area
over thousands of years.2

Based on a.rchaeological discoveries, at least 8,000 years ago Native

Americans would gather with their families in small groups beside local streams
and establish winter camps from which the men and boys would go on hunt-
ing expeditions. Several projectile points, used for spears or arrows, have been
found in recent times beside Tripps Run near Sisler's quarry and on Four Mile
Run, near the East Falls Church Metro station.3

Captain John Smith was the flrst European explorer who left a written
record of flora, fauna, and the native people when he explored the Chesapeake
Bay area and the Potomac River in  1608. His book on the subject was pub-

lished in  1624.

Prince Charles of England, later Charles 11, granted to loyal followers in
1649 over 5,000,000 acres of land between the Rappahannock and Potomac
Rivers and designa.ted it as the Northern Neck Proprietary. This included terri-
tory later to become Fairfax County and still later, Falls Church.

As English settlement of the area began in the late  1600s, county govern-
ments were gradually created along with Anglican parishes to administer civic
and religious life under the established Church of England.  Before Fair fax
County was created, Truro Parish was established in what was then Prince
William County. The parish vestry ordered at a meeting on March 26,1733,
the construction of The Falls Church, later named after the nearby Little Falls
of the Potomac River. It was a wooden frame building completed "at the Cross
Roads near Michael Reagans" in  1734.4

Fairfax County was established in  1742, but it was more than  100 years
later that the Falls Church postal village was designated. This resulted from the

growth of the settlement which included the immigration of northerners. The
road system between Leesburg and Alexandria had been improved when the
Middle Turnpike, now Leesburg Pike, was completed in  1839.

Following the Civil War, railroads, which had been built by 1860, electric

trolleys, telegraph, telephones, electric power service, and other transportation
and communication improvements made Falls Church a desirable place in
which to live.

Village leaders eventually requested a town charter from the General
Assembly. This was approved in  1875. Shortly thereafter a large public school
was built to educate the children of the community. At the beginning of the
twentieth century, in  1900, the population of the town was  1,007. By 1990,
the city's population was 9,522.  Proximity to the Federal Government and the

growth of the nation's capital in Washington, D.C. had profound
influences on the growth of. Falls Church, which became a city of the second

class in  1948.

Falls Church is located in the northeastern corner of virginia in the

Tidewater-Piedmont transition zone of the Potomac River watershed.  It is
seven miles southeast of and across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.

The climate is moderate with an average annual temperature of 57.8

degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature in January is 35.2 degrees and the
average temperature in July is 78.9 degrees. The annual precipitation is 47
inches, eight inches of snow and 39 inches of rainfall.

The frost-free season lasts about 200 days each year, long enough for the

growth of a wide variety of garden vegetables, fruits, flowering trees, deciduous
and coniferous trees, shrubs, and plants. In winter, the ground is generally
frozen only to a shallow depth. There are several types of soils and topographi-

cal details with gently rolling hills and pleasant stream valleys.

Responsive local government, citizen involvement, an excellent public
school system, tree preservation and planting, and historic preservation are
major concerns of the Falls Church residents of today.

en English adventurers including Captain John Smith arrived in

the Virginia colony in  1607 and settled at Jamestown, they found them
selves among a politically complex group of semi-sedentary Algonquian-

speaking Powhatan Indians. These Native Americans were living in more than
thirty small chiefdoms or districts within a regional district called Chicacoan
in the Potomac River valley. I

The earliest known written account of the Indians of Northern Virginia,
their customs and the local flora and fauna was recorded by Captain Smith,
who with fourteen other Englishmen left Jamestown in  1608 to explore and
map the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. These streams included the
Potomac River, on which they steered their two-ton open barge to where the
boat could go no farther upstream to the Little Falls, referred to as "the head
of navigation.''2

Smith and others have recorded names of eleven different Indian nations
or groups living along the lower Potomac from its falls to its mouth on the bay.
On the left bank or eastern shore, the Maryland side of the river, were the
Nacotchtanks, Piscataways, Pamunkeys, Nanj emoys, Potapacos, and
Yaocomacos.  On the Virginia shore were the Tauxenents, Patawomekes,
Matchotics, Chicacoans, and Wicocomocos.3 These different native peoples
occupied the area and hunted, farmed, flshed, and fought in the region at
European contact time.4

At the head of navigation, where Pimmit Run flows into the Potomac
RIver, trader Henry Fleet exchanged goods with the Iroquois Indians from the
north about  1630. He recorded not only having observed the plentiful supply
of sturgeon which the natives caught at the Little Falls but also noted that "as
for deer, buffaloes, bears and turkeys, the woods do swarm with them and the

soil is extremely fertile .... ''5

As permanent settlement by European landowners began, large plantations

were first established at choice locations along the main rivers and navigable
tributary streams. Yeoman farmers obtained long-term leases from the
Northern Neck Proprietary which had been flrst granted in  1649 by Charles 11
of England. They grew tobacco, corn, and other crops on their small farms.6

One of these humble farmers perhaps built a log house with large brick
chimneys at the future site of Falls Church. No early deed or other documenta-
tion for that land exists nor is a surname known. A cherished local tradition
holds that a large stone set in one of two large chimneys was engraved with the
number "1699." The "Big Chimneys" house, near the current site of the Falls
Church Post Offlce, was demolished between  1908 and  1914.  It is on this leg-
end of the flrst establishment of a dwelling in the community in  1699 that the
observance of the 300th anniversary is based.7

Three well-traversed game and Indian trails gradually became main north-

13

south thoroughfares, one the Sugarlands Rolling Road (now
Route  193, the Georgetown Pike), the second, the Falls Rolling
Road (now Route  120, Glebe Road and Little Falls Road), and
third, what was later called the Alexandria Road by Vestal's Gap
in the Blue Ridge. The early road westward and south followed a
natural drainage ridge to Difficult Run and was chosen as an
avenue of immigration by the first English settlers, also becom-
ing a rolling road in  1732 when the Hunting Creek warehouse

was built.8

By 1730, Governor Sir William Gooch had already reported
that although tobacco was Virginia's largest cash crop, export of
wheat from the colony was between  10,000 and 20,000 bushels

per year and that the greatest part of that was exchanged for
rum, sugar, salt, and molasses brought to Virginia by ships from
New England and Bermuda.9

Two powerful colonial landed gentlemen, Robert "King"
Carter and Thomas Lee, planned to establish a tobacco ware-
house at the Little Falls as early as  1728. However, the ware-

house was not built until  1742.10

A tobacco warehouse was built in  1732 on Simon Pearson's land on the
upper side of Hunting Creek in what was then Prince William County. The
land and warehouse lay within new boundaries when Falrfax County was
organized ten years later, in  1742. It was at the site of this warehouse that the
Town of Alexandria was established in 1749, the first town in Falrfax County.
Tobacco rolling roads were so called because tobacco leaves were tightly packed
into round wooden casks or hogsheads and rolled to the marketplace. These
early roads were established from western and northern inland farms to towns
built on the navigable rivers. One such early thoroughfare from Leesburg east,
later known as the Middle or Leesburg Turnpike, passed through the center of
the Falls Church community on its way to Alexandria.11

property with social standing in their county and were by law responsible for
the administration of religion and the moral health of all people in the parish.
They had to provide a minister, build and maintain churches, provide for the

poor, the sick and orphans, make presentment to the County Court in adultery
cases, appoint processioners to establish boundaries of patented lands, and
levy a poll tax annually on all tithables to pay for the costs. When a parish was
organized, the first vestry was elected and from then on the group was self-

perpetuating for they filled vacancies with their own appointees.1

The definition of tithables (taxable individuals) included all white males
over  15, and all males and females over  15. All negroes under 15 were exempt.
So, too, were all white women and white girls, no matter what their age.2
The General Assembly passed an Act in  1732 directing that Hamilton
Parish in Prince William County be divided and a new Anglican parish called
"Truro" be organized to include all of Prince William north of the Occoquan

River and Bull Run and west to the Blue Ridge. Soon after Truro Parish was
established, a meeting was held at the home of william Gunnell on upper
Four Mile Run.  In March  1733, the vestry decided to construct "a church
at the cross roads near Michael Reagans." A purchase of two acres was made
later with 50 shillings to landowner John Trammell. This is where The Falls
Church has always stood; first as a wooden weather-boarded building designed
and built in  1734 by Richard Blackburn and then in  1769, as a brick church
designed and built by James Wren. The site was in Stafford County until  1730,
from  1730 to  1742 in Prince William County, from  1742 to  1948 in Fair fax
County, and from 1948 to the present, within the City of Falls Church.3
Truro Parish vestrymen played major roles in the early history of The
Falls Church. Alnong them were Denis Mccarty, Richard Blackburn, William
Gunnell, John West, Charles Broadwater, William Fair fax, George William
Fairfax, Augustine Washington, George Mason, George Washington, and

James Wren.4

The first levy laid for Truro Parish took place in  1733 and furnished a
flne example of life in a society where tobacco served as a medium of exchange.
To take care of financial needs for the coming year in the parish, the vestry
required 45,399 pounds of tobacco to be raised by collecting 67 pounds from

each of 681  tithables.5

When Thomas, Sixth Lord Fair fax came to the Virginia colony in  1735
to discover for himself the potential of his Northern Neck Proprietary, he was
favorably impressed. In order to determine the exact boundaries of the more
than 5,200,000 acres involved he engaged John Warmer in  1737 to survey the
boundary lines and prepare a map for consideration by the King's Council in
London. The Virginia colonial officials engaged surveyor William Mayo to

21

prepare a map as well. Ultimately, the Warner
map was chosen as the official document.6
One of the landowners who lived near
and attended The Falls Church was John Ball,
a yeoman farmer, who received a proprietary

grant in 1742 from Thomas, Sixth Lord
Fairfax. His house was built on a 166-acre

piece of land beside Four Mile Run, down-
stream from his local Anglican church which
had been built in  1734. According to architec-
tural historians, it was typical of an ordinary

yeoman farmer's dwelling in the vicinity of
The Falls Church at the time. Made of simple
log construction, it has a clapboard roof. The
dwelling exists today in Glencarlyn having sur-
vived for more than 250 years.7

John Ball, his wife Elizabeth and their five

daughters all lived in this little house. County
court records made after John Ball's death in
1766 indicate that he and his family had
everything they needed to live a full life: axes
to cut down the trees and clear the land; tools

with which to build his house; and tools with which to make furniture. He had
cows for milk, cream, and beef; pigs for pork and bacon; sheep for food and
wool for clothes; geese for feathers for his beds; and bees for honey for his
bread. He owned a mill to grind his wheat and corn; he had a distillery for
strong drink; and a mare for transportation and plowing. He had guns for
hunting and protection; tools to tend and cultivate his land; linen and wooden
wheels for spinning; bed hides for warmth; earthen and wooden ware for din-
ing; cooking utensils; knives and forks. An iron and a looking glass were listed.
And after a day's work, he had his books, spectacles and even a fiddle for enter-
tainment.8 He was a well-documented example of a successful farmer who lived
near The Falls Church in the mid-1700s.

During the French and Indian War (1755-1763), a force under the com-
mand of British Major General Edward Braddock was sent against the French
in America at the forks of the Ohio River. Landing at the port of Alexandria,
troops, artillery and heavy baggage were gradually moved overland up the
Virginia and Maryland sides of the Potomac River to Fort Cumberland and
then west toward Fort Duquesne and what was to be a major defeat.9

British Deputy Quarter Master General Sir John St.  Clair had been
assigned the task of clearing or building the necessary roads to Fort Duquesne
and constructing boats that would be needed by the troops to cross streams
and rivers along the way. After a thorough inspection of the routes beginning
in January of 1755, St. Clair wrote describing the local roads at the time
as: Williamsburg to Fredericksburg, very good; Fredericksburg to Winchester,
very bad; and Winchester to Wills Creek, "85 miles of the worst road I ever

travelled."10

Troops both British and American assembled at Alexandria for the arduous

journey, most of them on foot. On April 7,1755, three companies of virginia
Rangers left Alexandria for Wills Creek via Winchester. Sir Peter Halkett's
Regiment of Foot (about 500 men) left camp at Alexandria on their way to
Winchester and Fort Cumberland using the road past the country lane to John
Ball's house and past The Falls Church. With the soldiers were marching

drummers, horsemen, cannons on wheels, wagons carrying tents, baggage, regi-
mental provisions, arms and ammunition. The sounds of many tramping feet
and loud voices; horses with their squeaking leather harnesses; creaking loaded
covered wagons; rumbling cannon gun carriages and colorful flags snapping in
the breezes were virtually unknown noises for the sparsely-settled farm families
who lived along the way.1l

On this military expedition was one Madame Charlotte Browne, a wid-

owed Englishwoman who was serving as a matron of nurses. She left
Alexandria with a convoy on its way to Winchester on June  1,  1755. Twelve
wagons and forty guards were in the group. They traveled past The Falls
Church and stayed overnight at the Old Court House (near Tysons Corner).
She commented in her diary entry the next morning, after bumping along
in a wagon all the previous day: "The Roads were so Bad that I am almost

disjointed."12

One result of this major colonial event was that the thoroughfare the mili-

tary used (now Route 7, Broad Street) was called "Braddock's Road" in the
community surrounding The Falls Church until the time of the Civil War-
more than  100 years.13

In February 1765, the House of Burgesses established a new parish-
Fair fax-out of part of the old parish-Truro. The very next year, a levy was
laid for the building of two brick churches, one "where the old Falls Church
stands and the other at Alexandria [now Christ Church] , the undertakers to
meet at The Falls Church and bring in their plans."14 James Wren produced a

plan which was chosen for both The Falls Church and the church at
Alexandria. He had just been appointed a vestryman "in place of Edward
Blackburn resigned."15 James Wren  (c.1728-1815)  proved to be an important
man of the crossroads community which he served well. Not only was he an
architect, builder, and a vestryman, but a

planter and farmer, a court justice, sher-
iff, county official, and finally, an

innkeeper.16

Population was steadily growing in

Fair fax County, especially around
Alexandria, and there was local demand
for a separate parish. After some disagree-
ments, the House of Burgesses reached a
consensus and in May 1765, a boundary
was deflned between Truro Parish and the
new Fairfax Parish in whose territory The
Falls Church was now located. Being in
bad repair, the old Truro Parish had
already directed in  1765 that the wooden
building be replaced with a new brick
ediflce. While the new brick church was
under construction between  1767 and
1769, the decaying wooden building was
the scene of antisocial behavior by one John Hirst, Jr., who was later presented
by the grand jury "for behaving in an indecent manner on Sunday the 17th
instant at The Falls Church by bringing a mare to his stallion in presence of

part of the Congregation in time of service." He was fined for this misdeed.17
Finally the beautiful brick church was finished. The Fairfax Parish vestry

agreed that James Wren had completed his work at the new Falls Church at
their vestry meeting held on December 20,  1769. Three months later, George

Drdujing of John Ball horyiesteed of 1767,

International events were soon to change life in the colonies and particu-

larly affect Falls Church vestrymen George Washington and George Mason.
After the British Parliament closed the Port of Boston on June  1,1774, Mason,
with the help of others, wrote the Fairfax Resolves which called for, among
other points, the need "to concert a general and uniform Plan for the Defense
and Preservation of our common Rights.''19

As war with Great Britain became a reality and recruitment of soldiers was
held at The Falls Church for service in that conflict, Milcah Trammell was laid
to rest in  1776. Her father had sold two acres of land to Truro Parish on which
the  1734 and  1769 church buildings had been erected. Milcah, youngest of

John and Susanna Trammell's seven children, had married wealthy Simon
Pearson, a union which had ended in divorce, a rare action in those times.20

ernment. No fighting occurred in Northern Virginia and the war's effects on
Falls Church were incidental.  But the village may be justifiably proud of the
actions of the men representing it in the Colony's revolutionary councils.

After Bostonians threw tea into their harbor to preclude its taxation by
English authorities in  1773, Parliament in London enacted legislation pun-
ishing the colonies and demanding their obedience to policy. Virginia led
the resistance to this legislation when its House of Burgesses  (now the House
of Delegates), meeting in the royal capital, Williamsburg, declared a day
of fasting, prayer, and "humiliation." The Governor, John Murray, Fourth
Earl of Dunmore, dissolved the Burgesses, which promptly reconvened and
issued a call for the colonies to send deputies to a coordinating conference
in Philadelphia. Hostilities soon commenced in Massachusetts and then in
Virginia.  Governor Dunmore fled Williamsburg, and the philosophical

debates began.1

Key to these proceedings were the communications, called "resolves,"

from thirty-one of virginia's counties conveying the sense of their citizens to
the Colony's first revolutionary convention in  1774.  Of particular note are
the Fzzz.r/zz)c I?c:fo/„c'f. These resolves, written by George Mason of Fairfax
County, were the most proactive and far-ranging of any presented. There
were twenty-four separate resolutions each beginning with the single word,
"Resolved"; three called for a continental congress of deputies from each

colony to decide general policy toward Britain; war, if the Crown failed to
redress grievances and publication of the names of citizens not subscribing to

patriot views against England. These ideas proved influential in Virginia's rev-
olutionary conventions and in the Continental Congress. The Fzzz.7/zzx J?cj.a/„c+
were presented by George Washington of Mount Vernon and Col. Charles
Broadwater, of Falls Church.2

The Colony's last revolutionary council convened in Williamsburg from

May 6 through July 5,1776. On May 15  its members, including Col.
Broadwater and John West, Jr., unanimously instructed Virginia's delegates to
the Continental Congress to introduce a resolution calling for independence.
Richard Henry Lee of virginia did so on June 7. Congress passed the motion
on July 2 and two days later issued the Declaration of Independence, written
by Thomas Jefferson.3

George Mason, a Fairfax County delegate to the revolutionary conven-
tion, drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights adopted by the convention
on June  12. This document, unmatched in its scope, guaranteed fundamen-
tal rights later repeated in the U.S. Bill of RIghts and French Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. These included freedom of religion,

27

freedom of the press, and the right to a jury trial by peers in both civil and

Criminal cases.4

Mason also drafted a constitution for Virginia, which was a novel "flrst"
for Englishmen anywhere who were not accustomed to a document deflning
and limiting the powers of government. Virginia's constitution, which declared
its independence from England, fashioned a republic and commonwealth-
a government of citizens united in their ideas of what constituted the common
„c¢4 or good.5

George Washington remained a vestryman of his parish through the

Revolution, not resigning until  1784, although he was unable to attend to his

duties on the church vestry while leading American
armies afield. Revolutionaries from Falls Church
included Col. Broadwater, who recruited soldiers for
the local militia in The Falls Church; Col. James
Wren, Col. Charles Little, John Follin, and Charles

Simms.6

The Declaration of Independence, a copy of which
arrived over the post road from Philadelphia, was read
from the steps of The Falls Church sometime during
the summer of 1776, as it was at many churches dur-
ing those fateful days.7

wrote an Ordinance of Religious Freedom which was presented to the Virginia
legislature and failed to be adopted. In December of 1785, however, a similar
law was proposed by James Madison and was adopted as the Virginia Statute
for Religious Freedom in January 1786.  It was generally applicable but specifi-
cally abolished the Anglican Church which had been the official state church
in the Virginia colony. Later serving as a model for the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution, the statute declared that no man could be compelled
to attend or support any church nor suffer any discrimination because of his
religious beliefs. The Fairfax Parish vestry was represented at the First
Convention of the new Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia held at
Richmond in May 1785.1

Methodism in Northern Virginia had begun to win converts before  1776,

the year when the Fairfax Circuit was officially established at a Methodist
conference held in Baltimore. At first local church meetings were held at
"Church Hill," the home (now gone) of Col. and Mrs. William Adams at

present-day Seven Corners. Fair fax Chapel was built and probably dedicated
in  1779, located on the present-day site of Oakwood Cemetery. Itinerant
Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury recorded in his journal that he preached
at Fair fax Chapel in  1780. A year later Asbury recorded that he had preached
at the chapel again, followed by a black preacher, Harry Hoosier, speaking to
an interested white audience.

About  1798, the original wooden chapel building was replaced by a larger

brick building on one acre of land later given to the Methodist Society by the
descendants of Col. George Minor of "Minor's Hill." There was a gallery above
the entrance where the African-American people sat. This second building was
in use until the Civil War when Union troops destroyed it and used the bricks
to build chimneys for their winter quarters.2

The Methodist Historical Society of Northern Virginia placed a plaque in

Oakwood Cemetery in April  1969 commemorating the site of the first
Methodist church in Northern Virginia, Fair fax Chapel.3

After much discussion about various locations, Congress authorized the

establishment of the nation's ten-mile-square Federal District of Columbia on
the Potomac River in  1790. Necessary land was ceded by Maryland and
Virginia. Surveying of the territory took place in  1791  and  1792, forty bound-
any stones being set at approximately one-mile intervals. The work was done
under the supervision of Major Andrew Ellicott, assisted by gifted astronomer
Benjamin Banneker, a free black man.4

In  1980, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service of the

Department of the Interior approved the naming of Southwest Boundary Stone
9, near Van Buren Street in Falls Church, after Benjamin Banneker to honor

31

his life and contributions. It was also

given the signiflcant major designation
as a National Historic Landmark.
The west cornerstone was sur-
rounded with a protective iron fence
by the Falls Church Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution
in  1952. Arlington County, Fair fax
County, and the City of Falls Church
established the surrounding park in
1956. The stone was placed on the
National Register of Historic Places in
1991. The Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors approved the naming of the

park after Andrew Ellicott in  1998. The
naming of the boundary stones after
Ellicott and Banneker was approved by
the Arlington County Board and the
Falls Church City Council in  1996.
The Banneker Park was publicly dedi-
cated on July  17,1999.5

passed Virginia land included the Town
of Alexandria, Fairfax County's seat of government. The County had therefore
to relocate their courthouse within the county boundaries. In  1798, the
4/ex¢72J7.z.a G¢zc#g announced that the Fair fax County Courthouse commis-
sioners had selected the plan of architect James Wren for the new public
buildings. Wren owned and operated an ordinary (inn) at the time near the
brick Falls Church.6

The farm-to-market journey from the Shenandoah Valley, and Loudoun

and Fairfax counties was greatly improved by the first bridge built over the
Potomac River from the Virginia shore, at Little Falls. The covered wooden
bridge, called the Falls Bridge, was constructed by the Georgetown Bridge
Company in  1797. After this structure was washed away by high water, it
was replaced in  1810 with a higher stone chain suspension bridge-"Chain
Bridge.„7

After Thomas Jefferson was chosen president of the United States by the
House of Representatives in  1801, he experienced some difflculty in assem-
bling his small official family.8 Finally anticipating his arrival, Jefferson wrote
his Secretary of State, James Madison, on April 30 about the wretched road
conditions in Northern Virginia at the time. On the advice of col. James
Wren, Jefferson engaged two farmers to supply two horses to draw Madison's
carriage "up the Bull run hill .  .  . really the worst I ever saw in a public road."
The sitting president advised his colleague and friend, Madison: "You had bet-
ter start as soon as you can see to drive, breakfast at Col. Wren's, and come
here to dinner. We shall wait for you till 4 o'clock."9

The inn or tavern belonging to the gifted architect of Pohick Church,
Christ Church and The Falls Church and the new Fair fax County Courthouse
was a landmark in its time. On the map drawn in  1801  by Jonathon Lovett of
his survey of the roads between Winchestcr and Alexandria, he designated as
"Col. James Wren's" the location now known as Falls Church.10

in their quarrels with other Europeans. After Britain began impressing
American seamen onto its ships at sea, local opinion shifted.

Until  1814 most of the fighting occurred far to the north of the mid-
Atlantic region and when the British threatened Washington, the federal gov-
ernment could not comprehend the scope of the danger.1  Most at fault was the
secretary of war, John Armstrong, who refused to believe the British would tar-

get Washington. Pandemonium ensued in the government and among citizens
as the British troops and fleet neared.2

Government offices evacuated their records across the river to Virginia on

or about August 23,  1814. Wagons for this effort were in short supply, howev-
er, as all able-bodied citizens were fleeing the city in wagons piled high with
their own personal goods. The scene was near bedlam in the city and on the

bridges leading to Virginia.3

Col.  George Minor and his 700-man Virginia Militia 60th Regiment were

summoned on August 23 from Falls Church, where they had mustered at
Wren's Tavern, to help protect Washington, but few came armed because an
attack was so unexpected. And due to bureaucratic bungling among war
department officials they were not sent to help defend the approaches to
Washington at Bladensburg.4

As conflicting reports reached Washington concerning the whereabouts of

the British troops, Commodore Thomas Tingey, commanding the Washington
Navy Yard, ordered his senior clerk, Mordecai Booth, to move the gunpowder
from the Yard's magazine to the interior of virginia. Booth, detailed to take the

powder to the farm of Sarah and Daniel Dulany, the commodore's daughter
and son-in-law at Falls Church, experienced great difflculty in flnding wagons
enough to accomplish this task. After crossing the Potomac bridge he encoun-
tered Col. Minor, who assigned a six-man guard to accompany him and his
cargo of explosives to Falls Church. Col. Minor and the rest of his regiment
hurried on to Washington, where they camped for the night in the Capitol.
Booth and his guard arrived at Wren's Tavern in Falls Church late on the night
of August 23, still one mile from the Dulany farm, and there spent the night.5

Before dawn news reached the tavern that American forces were abandon-

ing Washington to the British. Booth left for the Dulanys' farm at dawn, where
he found that 75 of 124 barrels and two quarter-casks of powder had been
unloaded and stored. The Dulanys' barn was woefully insecure, and Booth
went to the house of another local man, Dozier Bennett, with whom he
arranged to have a civilian guard posted at the barn until a Marine force could
arrive.  Booth then returned to the city.6

35

At the President's House (later the White House) the president's wife, Dolley

Madison, waited in vain for her husband's return. By mid-afternoon Mrs.
Madison wrote her sister, "Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect him! Two
messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly.... " She refused to leave until
the large portrait of George Washington was unscrewed from the wall, cut from
its frame and dispatched for safekeeping.  She then fled into Virginia, hoping to

join her husband, who, with most of his cabinet officials, dispersed to various

points.7

The roads between Falls Church and Washington were chaotic, disorderly,
and full of stragglers from Washington. Booth returned to the Navy Yard from
Falls Church to confer with officials and then rode out to determine the location
of the British troops. He soon collided with British redcoats, who had just
reached the District, and was fired upon. He fled back into the city, where he
found the Capitol deserted. Riding quickly to the President's House he discov-
ered it was dark, empty, and silent. A companion yanked violently on the front
door bell-pull, but no one was there to answer. Only then did Booth realize the

gravity of the situation: "the Metropolis of our Country was abandoned to its
horrid fate."8

Booth returned to the Capitol, where he was flred on again by the arriving
British, and then rode to the Navy Yard. Commodore Tingey, learning that the
enemy was in the city and unopposed, bade Booth farewell and torched the Yard.
It was twenty minutes past eight o'clock. In the Capitol the British Admiral
Martin Cockburn and his troops piled high the books and draperies and set them
afire. Booth, just reaching the Potomac bridge, looked back and saw the first
flames from the Navy Yard and the fort on Greenleaf's Point leaping into the sky.
By the time he ascended the hill on the Arlington end of the bridge the Capitol
was in flames.9

Booth stood on the hill with many other people, transflxed with horror by
the disaster unfolding before them. He reached Wren's Tavern in Falls Church at
midnight, where he found his family, escaped from Washington, waiting for him.
Everyone in the tavern was in a great state of excitement, and people and wagons
were passing constantly on the road outside (East Broad Street).1° President
Madison, the attorney general, and his entourage struggled through the crowded
oads toward Falls Church. Mrs. Madison, unable to make it that far in a heavy
rainstorm, stopped for the night at Rokeby, near Chain Bridge, the home of her
friend Mrs. Richard Love, northeast of Falls Church.11  From there Mrs. Madison
watched the flaring night sky. Her husband and his traveling companions
stopped frequently to turn back and look at the burning city. The conflagration
which was Washington-its burning ships, stores, homes, and public buildings-
could be seen as far away as Leesburg and Baltimore, where worried residents still
had no news of events. At daylight David Winchester of Baltimore wrote that no
one knew what had happened in Washington; "We only know from the light
during the night that the city was on fire."12 In the Falls Church area, from
which the burning city was clearly and distinctly visible, Miss Matilda Roberts, a
seven-year-old refugee from Alexandria who never forgot that night, was awak-
ened and taken outside to see Washington burn. "At first I thought the world was
on flre," she recounted later.  "Such a flame I have never seen since."13

Rumors bred in the chaos of that evening that slaves were revolting fright-

ened Mrs. Love into fleeing Rokeby at daylight for the interior of virginia. The
rumors grew in strength the further she went and so she turned and raced for
home. When her driver, a slave, remarked that he did not think the horses would
make it by nightfall, she feared he was part of the rebellion and decided to shoot
him if he stopped the wagon. He did not and they arrived to find that everyone

at Rokeby had fled to Falls Church, "where there was safety in
numbers." Mrs. Madison went to the home of Mrs. Minor,
outside Falls Church, where she stayed the next two nights
out of fear of the supposed rebellion.14

The next morning, August 25, Booth arose early at
Wren's Tavern in Falls Church and, taking the tavernkeeper's
son with him as guide, departed for Mrs. Minor's. There he was told President
Madison had stopped briefly the night before but was no longer there.  Booth
returned to Wren's, where he was met by Sergeant-Major Forrest with a guard
of about twenty-flve men and boys, there to guard the Navy's gunpowder, and
a troop of the Fair fax Dragoons. The presence of the explosive caused Falls
Church residents and the refugees they hosted great consternation, and they

petitioned Booth to remove the powder. This Booth agreed to do, and sent
scouts to locate a better storage spot four to six miles further inland. The scouts
failed to flnd any better location, and the powder remained stored in the

Dulanys'  barn.15

Returning to Wren's from the Dulany farm Booth discovered he had just
missed President Madison, who had stopped at the inn in search of his wife.
The president, whose movements were hampered first by reports that the
British were en route to seize him and then by reports of the slave insurrection,
eventually reunited with Mrs. Madison at Wiley's Tavern near Great Falls.16

0n August 29 the British fleet arrived off Alexandria, where panicked citi-
zens, the destruction of washington fresh on their minds, quickly surrendered
their city.  Booth rode to Alexandria from Falls Church, where he felt sickened
by the sight of the Union Jack flying above the District and the British fleet

plundering Alexandria. After sacking the port town's warehouses, the enemy
fleet moved downriver. The desperate Americans, in an ultimately vain attempt
to stop the fleet, set up large guns at the destroyed President's House (which
then had a seven-mile view downriver). Booth, galloping all the way to
Dulany's farm, dispatched two wagon-loads of powder to the President's
House. The powder was returned to Falls Church September 6 where it
remained until the  loth.17

Falls Church's proximity to Washington bound it inexplicably to the de-
fense of the capital. Future wars would follow in which this was also the case.

Internal Improuemeuts

I nineteenth century.

er-increasing transportation opportunities, and the economic and other

Eindfalls they created, were evident in Falls Church during most of the

Virginia law, following English precedent, required the citizens living
along its roadways to contribute work annually for their upkeep. This method
became less popular in Falls Church and elsewhere as growing commerce
increased wear a.nd tear on the roads. The merchants of Leesburg, the gateway
to the Shenandoah Valley, anxious to have a reliable connection with a market

port, established the Leesburg Turnpike Company in  1808. The company
built a road from Leesburg to Sugarland Run near Dranesville (at Route 7),
where it met a connector road financed by Georgetown-present route  193,
Georgetown Pike-connecting with Georgetown via the Chain Bridge. These
were completed about  1820.1

Georgetown and Alexandria were locked in competition for business from

the interior and from Baltimore and, when Georgetown's merchants fell on
hard times in the late  1820s, Alexandria's commercial leaders arranged for a
new, more direct link between their seaport town and Leesburg. These
arrangements culminated in  1829 in the Middle Turnpike Company, which
built a road from the eastern end of King Street along the colonial-era ridge
road through Falls Church, and on to connect with the Leesburg Turnpike at
Dranesville. Tolls were collected along this route beginning in about  1839.
The new road and the commerce it brought allowed Falls Church, long a
sleepy village,  to begin robust growth.2

Another new road which impacted Falls Church was one completed in
1852, linking the new Aqueduct Bridge across the Potomac with Fair fax Court
House. Its route between the bridge and Falls Church was, generally, that of
modern Wilson Boulevard.3

Falls Church's strength during these times was its location-a short day's
ride from Alexandria and Georgetown. Geography did not bless it with fast-
flowing water sufficient to power a milling industry, and area farmers did not

produce enough crops to export outside the local market, but Falls Church
was well positioned to provide services for travelers. As the roads improved and
commerce quickened the need for taverns and inns increased correspondingly.
By 1827 there were four in the area:  Gordon's near The Falls Church; Wren's,
between the church and modern Seven Corners; Minor's, at Seven Corners,
and Lindsay's (later MCTear's), west of the village on Pimmit Run. Wren's, in
business since at least  1785, was well-regarded and recommended by Thomas

Jefferson. It, as well as the other taverns, were social centers in which public
notices were posted, and official meetings and public sales of land and slaves
occurred. One historian called taverns such as these the "dominant public
spaces" of the era.  By present-day standards these inns offered crude lodging.
Travelers often shared beds and amenities were few. This changed as tra.velers
became more prosperous a.nd willing to pay for better services. The venerable

39

and long-lived Star Tavern, also located near
The Falls Church, joined local roadside hostel-
ries by mid-century.4

Better roads also offered greater convenience

to practice religious faith, and several churches
were added to the village by mid-century. Falls
Church was home to a vigorous Methodism as
early as  1774-the second such place in
Virginia, and one of the earliest in America. By
1780 the Falls Church Methodist meeting place
was called Fairfax Chapel. The first chapel, of
log and clapboard, was built in the late  1770s.
In Falls Church and throughout the former
colonies Methodism soon replaced Anglicanism
as the most popular faith, and the small chapel
was replaced in  1798 by a larger structure which
was, in turn, replaced by the last chapel, in what
is now Oakwood Cemetery, in early 1819.
Fair fax Chapel was the second church in the
area, after The Falls Church. Circuit riders
staffed the pulpit. The last Chapel, a substantial
building constructed of thick brick walls, was
forty-by-sixty feet in width and length, and
included a large gallery used for the "colored

people." This Chapel was dismantled by soldiers
during the Civil War who used its brick to build

Leesburg a,nd Alexandria Turnpike tollgate,

chimney flues in their encampments on the hills nearby.5

Presbyterianism was represented informally in the area beginning in  1812,

when a minister of that denomination began preaching occasionally in Falls
Church until his death in  1828. Presbyterian services were much more infre-

quent from  1828 until  1848, when regular preaching resumed in Falls Church
in the homes of various members. Services were interrupted by the Civil War
and did not resume until afterward.6

The Columbia Baptist Church congregation was established in  1856 and

built a wood-frame home with a steeple in  1857 next to The Falls Church.

The Falls Church, pro-

genitor of them all, fell upon
hard times in the decades fol-
lowing the Revolution. After

the close of hostilities Virginia
formally eschewed the official
state Church of England and
its followers moved to the
newly-established Protestant
Episcopal Church.  Stripped of
its guarantee of parish revenue
and humbled by its prior
association with English colonial authorities, The Falls Church lost much of its
congregation and closed its doors sometime between  1799 and  1806. It soon
fell into disrepair and, missing doors and windows, was open to the elements.
One passer-by noted that animals lived within. This state of affairs lasted until
1823, when several area residents attempted to reestablish it. While this
attempt to reopen The Falls Church was aborted it produced much-needed
repairs, including, apparently, a new roof.7

After 1823, and for the next fourteen years, the church again stood desert-
ed amidst unkempt surroundings, even as the village prospered.  It was used for
meetings of the new Falls Church Temperance Society in  1831, which met the
first Saturday of every month to promote among its members a liquor-free exis-
tence. In about  1835 students from the new Fair fax Seminary in Alexandria
became interested in The Falls Church and their labors led to reorganization of
its congregation in  1836. The church was again led by a rector from  1837 to

The Civil VVIar

ough the situation appeared grim after John Brown's raid at Harper's
erry, many in Virginia hoped to preserve the Union. But moderation was
overtaken by events.

AF

In April  1861  South Carolina began hostilities by flring on Fort Sumter
and on May 23,1861 Virginians voted to remove the Commonwealth from
the Union. In Fairfax County the vote was pro-secession. In Falls Church the
vote, while pro-secessionist, was badly split 44 to 26. Armed secessionist bands
in and around the Falls Church and nearby voting stations frightened the area's
northern sympathizers, a number of whom voted for secession, or stayed at
home, in fear of their lives.  "Vote this ticket," said one secessionist to Philip H.
Minor of Minor's Hill.  "If not, you are gone for.  .  ."I

Federal troops immediately occupied Alexandria and moved quickly from

the initial bridgeheads toward Falls Church and Ball's Cross Roads (modern
Ballston).  On June  1  the troops skirmished with secessionists-as Southerners
were called-near Bailey's Crossroads and at Fair fax Court House, the first
local events of the war.2

General Daniel Tyler and troops comprising several Connecticut militias

established a headquarters in Taylor's Tavern at Falls Church (on the hill above
modern-day East Broad Street at its intersection with Roosevelt Street). Falls
Church at this time was a compact village clustered around The Falls Church.
Between Taylor's Tavern and the village were tidy farmhouses, orchards, farm
land, and woods. In addition to its principal taverns, Taylor's and the Star,
across from The Falls Church, the prosperous little village and its environs
included four churches and about twenty-five houses. According to one con-
temporary observer the homes were ".  .  . of a superior character, proving the
owners to be persons of more than ordinary wealth and taste.  Rows of cedar
trees adorn each side of the street, and the yards around different residences

give it a most beautiful appearance."3

But Falls Church's beautiful appearance belied the disharmony which over-

took the area.  Fair fax Chapel closed its doors in the early spring of 1861, its
members divided by sectional loyalties and fearful of oncoming events.
Columbia Baptist Church fared little better. The stressful days of 1860 took
their toll as talk of possible secession by Virginia roiled the congregation. In
that year the secretary of the Potomac Association of Baptist churches recorded
in his minutes, "Columbia-Laboring under discouragements and opposition.
No cheering news to write. They are embarrassed for their house."4

This schism was reflected at the state level by the disintegration of the

General Assembly. In June  1861  delegates loyal to the Union met at Wheeling,
in Virginia's panhandle, and, declaring Virginia's governmental offlces "vacant,"
established the "Restored" state government. Francis Harrison Pierpont was
elected governor. Fairfax County, Falls Church, and Alexandria were represent-
ed, and Falls Church resident Daniel F. Dulany served as Pierpont's aide. In
1863 Virginia's western counties seceded to form West Virginia, and the capital

Meanwhile, full-scale operations by both sides began in the Falls

Church area. The Union controlled the territory from Taylor's Tavern east to
Alexandria, and the village center much more tenuously, but the country
immediately beyond Falls Church was in Confederate hands. On June 20,
1861, General Daniel Tyler telegraphed to the defensive forts in Arlington
from Falls Church that he believed an attack was imminent and asked for rein-
forcement. Two days later General Tyler telegraphed the forts another alarm
from Falls Church but, again, no action occurred.6

One innovation of this war was aerial reconnaissance-in this case from

hot air balloons. On June 22,1861, Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe with his

balloon, the E7€}crp7¢.jc, skirting Rebel scouting parties at Bailey's Cross Roads,
traveled to Taylor's Tavern at Falls Church, where it was used constantly during
the next two days. These ascensions appear to be the first aerial military recon-
naissance in the Western Hemisphere, and probably anywhere in the world.7

0n June 26  714c C4¢r/c:j`}o7¢ [S.C.]  114lcrc%rj/ incorrectly reported that Union
forces had taken Falls Church with a force of 5,000 men, confirming the con-
fused state of affairs in and around the village. Vice President Hannibal
Hamlin visited the picket line at Falls Church at around this time, "being anx-
ious to see how a Rebel looked at short range."8

Union and Confederate armies began massing for the first great battle of
the war, on the banks of Bull Run near Manassas, on July 21. Three massive
columns of union soldiers marched west, with one column, numbering about
15,000 men, passing through the Falls Church area. The affair at Bull Run was
expected by all in Washington to be a short one, in which Federal troops
would put a quick end to the rebellion. The Confederates, however, had a dif-
ferent agenda and superior leadership. The flghting, the cannonading of which
was clearly heard in Falls Church, turned against the Federals. Their advance
halted and they began an orderly retreat, which quickly degenerated into a

panic-stricken rout. Union soldiers "ran blindly, like beasts from a fire."9

In Falls Church the ragged Federals began streaming through the village in
twilight.  Pro-Unionist local citizens, who had believed they would be protected
by Union forces, found the seemingly endless retreating Union soldiers unnerv-
ing. Many quickly packed and left.10

Frightened soldiers passed through Falls Church all night long, and morn-

ing dawned over a village and countryside which, one Falls Church observer
said "seemed fllled with disheveled soldiers." During the night of July 22, the
day after the battle, advancing Confederate scouts, coming on the heels of the
last of the Union forces, penetrated the village.1l

After the Union disaster at Manassas, Confederates advanced east through

the village to Munson's and Upton's hills, which they then occupied.  General

James Longstreet established his headquarters in what is now the Lawton
House at Falls Church, to which he extended the Confederate Military
Telegraph, and from which he conducted councils of war directing the Army of
Northern Virginia. J.E.B. Stuart and his  1 st Virginia Cavalry established them-
selves on Munson's Hill, in full view of the U.S.  Capitol. Stuart took great
delight in directing his artillery to take "practice" shots at Professor Lowe's bal-
loon, which now ascended from the forts in Alexandria County (now
Arlington County)  to observe their movements, and in causing the "Long
Roll"  (battle and mobilization signal, sounded by drums)  to sound all along
the Union front by feigning attacks. This was probably the first incidence of
anti-aircraft fire anywhere.12

For the Confederates their time in Falls Church was a holding action,

intended to divert Federal attention from the build-up of their forces under
way at Centreville. They constructed fcke earthworks on Upton's and Munson's
hills and "fortified" them with fal±e cannons.13

An early and major battle of the local front of the war occurred in and
around Lewinsville on September  10,1861. Numerous companies of union
and Confederate soldiers, the latter from Falls Church, engaged in sharp clash-
es in the darkness of the roads and woods between Falls Church and
Lewinsville. It was a terrible night for the Union soldiers, who were outmaneu-
vered and outgunned by their opponents. On the evening of september  13
Professor Lowe, ascending in his balloon from Chain Bridge, saw what
appeared to be two burning buildings just east of Falls Church and another on
an adjacent hill, surrounded by large crowds of cheering and boisterous rebel
soldiers: the Confederates were
celebrating their victory at

Lewinsville.14

0n September 24

Professor Lowe made military
history when he ascended from
the Arlington Heights and tar-

geted fire from Fort Ethan
Allen (near Chain Bridge) on
Confederate forces at Falls
Church. This was the first aeri-
ally directed artillery fire in
American hi\story. Using a tele-

graph machine in the balloon
basket Lowe signaled the fort,
three miles away, to correct its
flre when flring fell short.

fire. And thus Falls Church earned
the dubious distinction of becoming
the first community in history to be
bombarded by aerially-directed flre-
to become common in future wars.15
A smaller engagement occurred
on September 25 as the 600-man
Seventeenth Virginia Infantry,
encamped at and around The Falls
Church, was joined by the Second
South Carolina Infantry and the
Washington Artillery for an attack
on federal troops at Lewinsville and
Langley. ".  .  . While loitering around
the church," William A. Andrews of
the First Georgia Infantry later

wrote, "everything apparently at peace with the world, the long roll was beat to
arms. The regiment was quickly formed in the road. Couriers were dashing at
breakneck speed in every direction. Gen. Longstreet, whose headquarters was
not far from the church, was soon in the saddle. It was not long before the
Ninth Georgia, the Second South Carolina, Thirteenth Virginia, Col. Stuart's
regiment of Black Horse Cavalry, and Capt. Rosser's battery of artillery was on
the grounds, and away we went in the direction of Lewinsville." Another
Confederate victory ensued, after which the southern forces returned after
nightfall to Falls Church, where their hearts were "gladdened by the camp fires
of about 20,000 Confederate soldiers.''16

One consequence of Lowe's frequent ascensions to view rebel forces at Falls
Church was his discovery that the ominous "fortifications" on the hills outside
the village were not backed by corresponding levels of troops and equipment.
But the ruse had served its purpose: Confederate forces were nearly flnished
fortifying Centreville.17

On September 29 the Confederates

quietly evacuated Falls Church and its
hills for their "impregnable" position on
the Centreville heights and a forward post
at Fairfax Court House. Surprised Federal
troops quickly reoccupied Falls Church
and its hills. The next day, reflecting on
the day's ev;nts, a pleased but surprised
G€neral Heintzelman, not yet compre-
hending the successful two-month long
Confederate feint which had just con-
cluded, wrote, "We have possession of
Fall's Church and Munson's Hill .  .  .

There was no resistance."18

cupied the area some of them wreaked
vengeance or damage on unfortunate
southerners. Members of the Twenty-
second New York Infantry dismantled
Fairfax Chapel in the winter of 1862 and
used its brick for chimneys at their winter
headquarters nearby. Members of the
Twentieth New York Infantry Regiment
defaced the interior of The Falls Church
with graffiti (their names and regimental
identiflcation) in the winter of 1861 ;
their commanding offlcer made them
return the church to its former state. But
other units soon followed suit. This dam-
age paled in comparison with what would
happen to the church later in the war.
Union forces flrst used it as a hospital and
later as a stable, tearing out the furnish-
ings, floor, and walls below the windows
to afford their horses better ingress and
egress. Columbia Baptist Church was
damaged by secessionist forces during their occupation of the town. And it is
difficult if not impossible to tally the losses suffered by villagers whose homes,
crops, and flelds were harmed.19

The Falls Church figures prominently in the accounts of soldiers of both

sides of the conflict. One soldier of the Twenty-third New York Infantry,
attended services held there by his regimental chaplain on November 9,1861:
"Nearly all the men went, more, I guess, out of curiosity and novelty than from

a desire to attend church. We carried our arms which were stacked in front of
the building .  .  ." The church, "which has obtained such a notoriety in the

present struggle," he writes, is not grand; "It is its age and association connect-
ed with it that gives it its sacredness which, in fact, has almost entirely shielded
it from devastation."2o

Several nurses, volunteers dispatched by the U.S. Sanitary Commission,

ministered to the sick in Union hospitals in Falls Church. Two of them,
wealthy socialites from New York City, arrived in the winter of 1861-62 and
found men from a nearby New York regimental unit, most suffering from
typhoid in a field hospital in The Falls Church. The patients, they recounted,

were emaciated and pale.  "Come and take care of me, and I shall get well," said
one soldier when the ladies first entered.  "If you do not come, I shall die."
When they began service in the hospital it held thirty-nine patients, with six
former patients lying dead but unburied in the "dead-house."21

Falls Church was then the only village between Alexandria and Vienna,

and many soldiers identified themselves in letters home as being posted "near
Falls Church." In truth, most were posted on the hills west and northwest of
the village center-Minor's, Munson's, Perkins' and Upton's hills, for which
Falls Church was the only identifiable point of reference. Soldier camps dotted
the slopes of Minor's and Upton's hills, in particular, causing nearby farms great
damage as soldiers removed fence rails to use as flrewood; fruits and vegetables
for eating; hay and other crops for feeding horses; and cattle, hogs, and pigs for
slaughtering. Valuable timber was felled, and left lying on the ground, in order
to clear gunnery ranges from the forts on Upton's and Perkins' hills: much of
what is now the eastern areas of the City of Falls Church were entirely denuded
of trees. It is difflcult to say how many soldiers were encamped in and around
Falls Church at any one time, as companies came and went frequently, but it
appears safe to say that at certain times during the war several thousand sol-
diers were posted within two miles of the village center.

The Manassas region was again the center of a major battle in August and
September  1862. The second Battle of Manassas, or Bull Run, disrupted life in
Falls Church as Union officials, preparing to burn the village to prevent its use

by the Confederacy, ordered the vil-
lage evacuated. Local residents fled
with as much livestock and personal
belongings as they could carry, and
again Falls Church was deserted.
Rebel armies moved in opposite direc-
tions, however, sparing the village
from a fiery fate.22

Within days of the second battle

at Bull Run a human tidal wave of
misery and suffering descended on
the village as  1,600 sick and wounded
soldiers were brought to Falls Church.
The Presbyterians' Groot Hall,
Columbia Baptist Church, The Falls
Church, and many homes were

pressed into service as hospitals.
Five days after the battle ambulances
continued to arrive hourly in Falls

Church.23

Armed skirmishes and incursions were a continuing and often daily facet
of life in and around Falls Church throughout the war. Some were larger than
others: one, involving the 84th New York Infantry and the 300-man First
Virginia Cavalry, occurred one mile west of the village in November  1861  as
the Virginians were intercepted while attempting to gather "valuable informa-
tion" from the vicinity.24

In May 1864 the Thirteenth New York Cavalry headquartered itself in
Falls Church. Its commander soon complained that Col. John S. Mosby's high-
ly successful raiders were "continually around us" and observed that "the small
force of cavalry here can hardly damage the enemy. We number hundreds, and
they thousands." The erstwhile commander must certainly have been dismayed

50

by the September 14,1864 lightning raid by
Mosby against his headquarters, in which
Mosby captured the brigade butcher and
then returned to capture a quartermaster's
establishment which was only three hundred

yards from a cavalry brigade.25

The Thirteenth New York Cavalry
scored a victory against Col. Mosby on
October 2,  1864 when it captured his arse-
nal and personal saber and brought them to
Falls Church. Revenge, pure and sweet, may
have been on the minds of Mosby and 75 of
his raiders as they attacked Falls Church at 2
a.in. October  18, killing two members of the
village's home guard and capturing pickets of
the Sixteenth New York Infantry. Their raid
was disturbed by J. 8. Read, pastor of
Columbia Baptist Church, who blew a horn
to alert the rest of the village guard and the
16th. Mosby's men captured Pastor Read
and later executed him.  "That Baptist

preacher Read got what was coming to
him," said one. His wife and daughter were

granted safe passage to drive a wagon to
Tyson's Corner to retrieve his body. He is
buried in The Falls Church yard.26

The Falls Church was witness to many

more wartime funerals than just Read's.
Many Union soldiers were interred there,
some in unmarked (and presently unknown)

graves. Their funerals, commemorating
deaths of unusual and cruel variety ("rapid
consumption"; purpura haemorrhagica, "a
very rare disease''; typhoid; death by freezing; and, of course, death in battle)
were sad affairs conducted with regal, but simple, military pageantry.27

As the war closed in  1865  Falls Church again observed massive troop

movements-these all passing through the village, many camping in or near it,
destined for the final review of troops by the president in Washington. The vil-
lage and its inhabitants suffered many privations in the course of the conflict-
churches shuttered, congregations divided; families split on basis of sectional
loyalties; the prosperous and fertile fields alternately trampled and neglected;
the village deserted during the most dangerous points during the war; a local

pastor killed; and the local economy in ruins. Falls Church, just outside the
capital's defensive fortiflcations, and never in the complete and uncontested
control of either side, had been a particularly busy area during the Civil War.
Over eighty-flve regiments are known to have camped in or passed through the
area. The hopes and fears of the Confederate nation were met in bloody battle-
fields on the "sacred soil" of virginia, and Falls Church played a role.
Reconstruction, of a most personal and wrenching kind, would occupy the vil-
lagers of Falls Church for a long time.

A Sense Of Commundy

newcomers from New England, the mid-Atlantic states, and the mid-West.
Attracted to the area by good farmland available at bargain prices, a relatively
mild climate and prospects of economic growth, these Northerners brought
new energy; new capital and new ideas about how to get things done.

The incorporation of the village into the Town of Falls Church in  1875

gave it new legal status with control of part of its taxes, roads, schools, and
other public facilities. For the next quarter of a century, the town grew in pop-
ulation and prosperity as it increased its agricultural output for sale to
Georgetown, Washington, and Alexandria merchants.

Churches were organized to serve as both religious and community centers.
The Falls Church, Fair fax Methodist Chapel, and Columbia Baptist had been
built prior to the Civil War. Shortly after hostilities ceased, the "colored settle-
ment» built both the Galloway Methodist and Second Baptist churches. The
white community then built, in a period of fewer than twenty years, Dulin
Methodist, Crossman Methodist, St. James Catholic Chapel, First
Congregational, and Falls Church Presbyterian churches. I

Virginia's  1869 Underwood Constitution made many changes including
new laws regulating both the county forms of government and universal public
education in the Commonwealth. Where appointed justices had formerly been
responsible for administration of county affairs, the new rules called for eventu-
al division of each county into magisterial districts within which voters would
select a representative to serve on a Board of County Supervisors. Court jus-
tices were to be responsible for judicial affairs only. Universal education was

promised, although separate schools were to be provided for white and black
children.2

A Board of School Trustees for each magisterial district was responsible ini-

tially for adopting rules for government of schools within their district. On
March 6,1871, a public notice was printed and distributed for the Falls
Church school district announcing seventeen rules. The many daily procedures
to be followed included opening exercises requiring reading of sacred scrip-
tures. Pupils were to appear in school with proper neatness; a pupil possessing a

pistol or other dangerous weapon was to be suspended; and no teacher or pupil
was permitted to use tobacco in any form during school hours.3

Efforts were made to put together broken pieces of things everywhere,

especially where railroads were concerned. The Alexandria, Loudoun and
Hampshire Railroad bridges had to be rebuilt. Tracks were replaced and nature
herself had to be pushed back in the places where she was reclaiming the right-
of-way with rapidly growing saplings, shrubs, and vines. When the railroad was
again functioning and renamed the Washington and Ohio Railroad, President
U. S. Grant and members of his cabinet rode it through Falls Church in  1873

59

on a day-long junket to visit Leesburg and
the exhibition of the Agricultural Society
at the Fair Grounds. They listened to the
town band and had dinner with Col. John
W.  Fairfax.4

By a Virginia Act of Assembly

approved in  1875, portions of Fairfax and
Alexandria (now Arlington) counties were
"made a town corporate" named Falls

Church.  Besides being incorporated, the
town's charter was adopted. A long-stand-
ing tradition holds that Joseph Riley of
"Cherry Hill" lobbied the act through the

legislature to successful passage. Town
councilmen appointed were J. J. Moran, T.
T.  Fowler, J. E. Birch, Isaac Crossman, L.
E.  Gott, G. 8. Ives, and Joel Carter. Henry

J. England was appointed Town Clerk and
E. Frank Crocker, Town Sergeant.5

At the first organizational meeting

of the mayor, J. J. Moran and the flrst
councilmen, J.  S. Riley was asked to
deliver in person the offlcial notice
to the Hon. James Love, Fair fax County's
Commonwealth's Attorney, that the
Council had been organized following the
incorporation by the Virginia Assembly
of the Town of Falls Church.6 Ordinances
of the Towns of Keyser and Hamilton were
to be used as models for drafting suitable

The flrst ordinance adopted regulated flreworks, guns and pistols "and

things pertaining to the same." Subsequent ordinances were adopted for pre-

nity, served the Town of Falls Church for ten or more years, first as town ser-

geant from  1876 to  1880, and then as a town councilman from  1880 to  1889.
No Town Council minutes have survived for the years  1885 to  1897.9

One subject which appeared on the Council's agenda at almost every meet-

ing was the need of repairs for roads, bridges, and sidewalks. Loads of stone
were bought at 25,  50, or 75 cents per ton,
hauled and broken up by hand using large stone
hammers or a mechanical stone crusher, and

placed in the gaping holes in the non-hard-sur-
faced roadways.10 Bridges were usually built of
wooden planks and they quickly rotted from use
and weather and had to be replaced.11

Sometimes standing water was a problem.
Councilman G. M. Thompson complained at one
Council meeting that he needed sidewalks for his
house as he "could scarcely get in or out after a
heavy rain and his dooryard was at times naviga-

ble for small boats."12

Public school education was a major concern
of the Town. G.A.C. Merrifield presented a peti-
tion signed by taxpayers to the Council in  1876
to levy a tax for the purpose of sustaining public
free schools in the Corporation.13 More than two

years later, the Town Council called a public
school meeting to devise means of continuing the

graded school and to form a committee to deter-
mine the advisability of being relieved from the

County tax for schools.14

The following year,1879, the Town Council

recorded in the minutes a high degree of frustra-
tion over the school situation: "Whereas, the State
of virginia having failed to provide for the main-
tenance of County and District public schools in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution
of the state of virginia and the necessity of a pub-
lic school in the Town of Falls Church" a resolu-
tion was passed by the Council calling for a
school-age population census and making a determination of the amount of
assistance available for conducting a corporation public school from the State,
County, District or other funding sources.  "The said school shall be under the
control and direction of the Council of Falls Church and their delegated
appointments."15 I. S. Riley, who had been elected to the Town Council in
October 1876, stated for the record that "this matter of public schools is of
vast importance and something should be done by the Council in order tha.t an
effort may be made to have a public school in the Corporation." Mayor Ives
appointed to the Committee on Schools: J. S.  Riley, G. M. Thompson and

J.C.H. Brown.16 Action begun immediately resulted in the opening of the

"Highland View," built about  1870 as

the country home of a Wlashington banker,

in a  1949 uieu). Edmurid Fhgg, U.S.

Consttl to Venice,  moved here in  1871

An issue which had long been
under discussion in the town was finally
resolved when the Council voted to pur-
chase three acres of land adjoining the
old Methodist Chapel grounds for a
cemetery. A large committee of promi-
nent citizens was appointed to view the

Proposed site.18

Another problem was flre flghting.
The Council discussed various measures
in  1879 and early in  1880 ordered flre
buckets and wood with which to build
six flre ladders of different lengths.19
Petitions signed by more than a two-
thirds majority of voters favored purchase
of fire apparatus in  1899, with a levy for

purchase of fifteen cents tax per $ 100
carried. The Council approved the bid of
the C. T. Halloway Fire Engine Co. of
Baltimore for the purchase of a flre

engine.20

One of the present businesses in Falls

Church was established in  1883. James
W. Brown came to Falls Church from
Loudoun County where he had grown
up and been a school teacher. He pur-
chased for his store and home a structure
built by Edward Birch in  1866. Between
1872 and  1881  it was also used as

the post office.2l

The Village Improvement Society

of Falls Church was organized in the fall
of 1885. It was modeled after the famous
Laurel Hill Society of Stockbridge,
Massachusetts and its objectives were to

Secorid Baptist Church, an African-
American congregation off Amtlndele Ri)ad,

1921. This building, constructed in  1870,

was abandoned in f;avor of the building in

use today, bttile in  1926. The church was

founcled in the area of the I;oiiin of Falls

1887. Scrapbook of Barban williams.

aid in improving the condition of the village. In  1892, the Society inaugurated
the first observance of Arbor Day in the Commonwealth of virginia. It was
held at the Jefferson Institute.22

A section of the town south of the thoroughfare then known as the Falls

Church and Fairfax Courthouse Road was by a Virginia Act of Assembly
returned to the jurisdiction of Fair fax County. This amendment, passed
in  1887, directed the transfer of the boundary of the section of land then
called "the colored settlement" to outside the corporate limits of the town.23
Since 26 percent of the black males voted Republican the boundary change

gerrymandered the territory in favor of the remaining Town voters who were
mainly Democrats.24

Communications were markedly improved when the Falls Church
Telephone Company was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly in
1888. Its incorporators were forward-looking citizens of the Town and includ-
ed Robert Morrison, W.  H.  Doolittle, Schuyler Duryee, E. J. Northrup, Dr. T.

A clear indication of the rapidly-increasing popularity of Falls Church as a

residential village was given in the Ftzz.r/zzx fJc#jz# in  1891. A special train was
run from Washington on a Tuesday in June bringing about 400 people to a sale
of lots in the new Sherwood subdivision. "The bidding was active from the
start, and ninety-two lots were sold at an aggregate price of $23,000."
Developer Church must have been pleased.26

Merton Elbridge Church was born in Orleans County, Vermont in  1858,

son of Joshua and Mary Elizabeth (Cobb) Church. After his father died while
serving in the Union Army, in  1862, his mother married George S. Spofford
and eventually moved to Virginia.

Merton E. Church was a talented entrepreneur. He was trained as a phar-

macist in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and owned pharmacies in Herndon and
Falls Church. He went into the real estate and insurance business and devel-
oped a telephone system throughout Northern Virginia which he eventually
sold to the Chesapeake 8c Potomac Telephone Company in  1916. The Falls
Church Improvement Company, of which he was general manager and a la.rge
stockholder, successfully developed "Sherwood" in Falls Church, west of the

present-day Lincoln Avenue, and one of the first subdivisions put on the mar-
ket in Fair fax County. He was a founder and director of the Falls Church Bank
and served on the boards of several others, and was an ardent supporter of rail-
way service to Northern Virginia. Ironically, Church was also a strong advocate
for another improvement-road building.27 Gradually roads replaced rails for

preferred transportation.

York,  Pennsylvania, Ohio,  Indian,  Illinois, Connecticut, and other states

found themselves telegraphing home the news,  "Ordered to Falls Church, Va."I

The various state militias were in need of training before deployment. The War
Department in Washington secured a two-square mile tract of land west of
Falls Church which it named Camp Russell A. Alger after the secretary of war.

Camp Alger occupied the area roughly bounded by the present Lee Highway,
Hollywood Road, Gallows Road, Arlington Boulevard and Graham Road.2

Over twenty regiments forming the U.S.  Second Corps took residence there,

totaling almost 30,000  soldiers.

Typhoid broke out in mid-July  1898. Most soldiers and officers blamed

the "water famine," caused by lack of drinkable water for the fever and for the
cases of diarrhea which plagued the camp. The incidence of typhoid, which

sickened many and accounted for most of the seventy-three deaths reported
there, flgured prominently in soldiers'  diary entries and letters home, prompt-

ing recriminations felt in the state capitals and in Washington.3

But all was not hardship. Troops made excursions into Washington, where

they usually visited the Capitol, Navy Yard, Library of Congress, and
Smithsonia.n. These trips to and from Falls Church overwhelmed the train sta-
tions and streets, causing disarray and chaos in the town.  Provost guards from

Camp Alger encamped permanently at East Falls Church to assist in maintain-
ing order and directing traffic.  One soldier wrote,  "The pandemonium  [at East

Falls Church's trolley station]  hcrc is something frightful. Tickets are purchased
in the store across the track, while lemonade, soda water and candy vendors

combine with colored bootblack and clothes ttrush boys, not to mention the
hackmen, to raise a rumpus which is absolutely unforgettable."4

Falls Church residents sometimes bore the brunt of soldier roughhousing

and war games.  On the evening of July 2, men of the Sixth Pennsylvania

Infantry, erroneously believing themselves released for the Independence Day
weekend, left on foot. Troop "A" of the New York Cavalry was called to arms:
"We galloped over the main road  [Lee Highway]  to Falls Church,  a cloud of

dust enveloping all but the flrst two sets of fours." The troops must have made

an impressive appearance, as the leaders,  followed t>y the moving cloud, thun-

dered down the steep hills with their weapons clashing, and the drawn sabres

gleaming in the moonlight at intervals through the dust.  Falls Church, howev-
er, was "quiet as the grave." Troop "A"  then "commenced a wild chase, scouring
the surrounding country on every side in the direction of wa`shington." One

by one the missing Pennsylvanians were rounded up, sometimes thirty men at

a  time.  5

The colorful Troop "A" visited Falls Church aga.in en masse,  this time to

make a "grand attack" on the village. They were careful to leave blank car-

75

tridges behind at camp so that "the villagers might not suppose that the civil
war had recommenced." They were then surprised by Troop "C," which did
not leave behind blank cartridges,  and a "lively"  (and surely noisy)  engagement

followed.`'

Falls Church residents found Camp Alger a very noisy neighbor indeed.

Much of the village was within earshot of the gunfire emanating from the prac-

tice skirmishes there.  Each day began and closed with regimental buglers

sounding reveille and taps, the notes echoing over the fields and woods.  "The
neighingofhorscs,therattleofemprywagons,trampofthetroops,while

above all sounded the ceaseless roll of drums or practice of bands  .  .  .  made a
life of activity comparable to nothing outside the army," wrote one soldier,

adding,  "Singing, as in all camps, was a favorite pastime with the men  .  .  .
Each company had its glee club, and after supper, as night fell, you were sure
to hear from every  [company]  street the familiar choruses by the men, varied

by occasional solos by the best singers.  `Break the News to Mother,'  `Say Au

Revoir,' `Nearer, My God, to Thee,'  `Marching Through Georgia,'  `The Old
Oaken  Bucket,'  etc., were favorites of an endless  repertoire."7

Coexistence of the massive camp with the adjacent town of Falls Church

was always tenuous. Temperance leaders in the village were incensed by

the "boom-town" called the Midway Plaisance,  named for the camival strip
made famous by the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of 1893,
which grew along the Warrenton Pike (present-day Lee Highway)  in the
vicinity of Merrifleld. The tents, shacks, stalls and vendors' stands of the

Plaisance supplied the soldiers with alcohol which, many in the village felt,

was cause of much of the carousing by soldiers which took place there.
Coexistence of the two-village and camp-was also sorely tested by Falls
Church residents' dislike of being stopped by army road patrols while going

about their own  business.

The visit of President William MCKinley provided Camp Alger its biggest

day on May 22 as he brought several cabinet officers and foreign dignitaries
to review the troops.  Fifteen thousand soldiers prepared to parade before the

president and his entourage, and the troops assigned to escort him from the
train sta.tion busily polished brass and brushed off uniforms, but to no avail:

had been choking in the dust, to the forefront.8

The president was by no means the only dignitary to visit Camp Alger.

Clara Barton,  Dr. Walter Reed,  representatives of the German Embassy and

Chinese Legation and of the Norwegian and revolutionary Cuban armies all

paid calls, as did members of Congress. And Carl Sandburg,  a soldier at the
time, wrote that "near Falls Church, Virginia, only a few miles from the

Capitol dome,  I lived in a tent, answered roll call six and eight times a days,
cut saplings and built myself a bunk, more than once made a practice march

been Falls Church's greatest fireworks display until recent years.10

But the war was among the shortest in

American history. Most at Camp Alger never saw
combat.  Even after the Kingdom of Spain signed

peace protocols,  insurrection continued in the
Philippine Islands,  requiring garrison troops,

but Camp Alger's role was ended. The last of
the regiments departed September 8. The troops
had wreaked such havoc on the land tha.t it was
"a bleak sand waste" and unproductive for many

years  to  come.11

Lessons learned in  1898-the necessity and
ability to coexist with welcome and unwelcome cir-
cumstances, developments, and conditions-were

to prove instrumental  to  Falls  Church's success  in
the century soon to dawn. The villagers' new-found
flexibility and adaptability would soon assert itself

in positioning the town for growth and prosperity
during what many would come to call "the
American century." The Spanish-American War

proved a valuable litmus test for Falls Church for
the changi.s soon  to come.

Domestic Tranquilly

A Camp Alger closed down and Spanish-American War soldicrs' activities

ad ceased to have an impact on  Falls Church,  the Town Council turned
its attention to local problems.  Fire equipment was purchased and the
Fire Company was invited to participate in the Fourth of July parade.I  Many

commuliity affiniry groups had been organized in Falls Church by  1899. They

included a wide variety of intere`sts:  the Potomac Fruit Growers Association, a
farmers' cooperative;  the Independent Order of Good Templars; the Village

Improvement Society;  the International Order of odd Fellows;  the Kemper

Masonic Lodge,  the Volunteer Fire Department; and the R.  E.  Lee Chapter,
Daughters of the Confederacy.2

The future for the new twentieth century looked especially bright with the

establishment of a highly-respected training school under an energetic and
well-trained principal, Mattie Gundry, and a Falls Church library which was in
the next hundred years to become a vital cultural and educational center for

residents of town and city.J

Educator Miss Mattie Gundry purchased residential property on West

Broad Street near Little Falls  Street from Schuylcr Duryee in  1899.  She

enlarged the building and developed a campus for the Virginia Training School
which she operated successfully for almost fifty years.  She taught her mentally

disadvantaged students useful  knowledge and skills to enrich  their lives.4

Nonfunctioning oil street lamps or problems with  the lamplightcr seemed

to appear almost every month in the council's  1899 minutes.  Complaints

about the poor maintenance of the electric trolley crossings on the public

streets were almost as frequent.  One petition asked that someone fix the culvert

at a crossing "to  at least make the water run downhill."5  Living with  the rail-
roads was not easy.  One resident requested that the mayor effect abatement of

the noise made t)y the Southern  Railway's locomotive whistles.(`

Vandalism had become a problem and by  1901,  the council adopted a res-
olution authorizing the mayor to put the town sergeant on active duty to con-

trol  disorderly conduct (]r to appoint special policemen for the purpose.7  Litter

was another ever-present source of irritation. The VIllagc Improvement Society

requested at a council  meeting that same year that the litter ordinance be strict-

ly enforced.8

Future author James Thurber and his family,  including two brothers, lived

in a rented house on Maple Street in the summers of 1901  and  1902, when hc

was six years old.  In letters to Mrs.  Frank Acosta in  1958  and  1959, Thurber
recalled some of his vivid memories of Falls Church.  Fascimted by one of the

town's employees, he wrote:  "Our garbage was collected by an ancient white-
haired negro,  no more that five feet tall, whose two-wheeled oxcdrt was pulled

by a brace of oxen.  His appearance never failed to enchant us boys, for hc was
not only out of the South, but out of the past, even out of fiction,  as remark-

able as old Uncle Tom himself." It was in Falls Church that Thurbcr lost one of

his  eyes as  the result of a childhood accident.`J

83

The Thurbers were followed by
many renters for both summer and

winter.  By  1903,  real estate agents,

subdivision developers  and poten-

tial  residents of Falls Church were

using the trolley services.  In  addi-

tion to land purchases,  renters

were eager to live in Falls Church

in all seasons. The F#z.r/zzx fJc#jz/J'j

Falls Church correspondent pub-
lished the information that "more

people have recently rented houses
in our town for the winter than

was ever known before. A house is
scarcely vacated by the summer

residents before a new tenant

moves  in."10

Cultural enrichment was

beginning to be a part of village

life. The Falls Church Library

not get electricity until  1912.  It proved so

its Board of Control published a  C4f#/ogace a/Boo4f listing all of the 650 items

in their collection. The civic-minded officers for  1903 were Pickering Dodge,

president;  Dr.  George 8.  Fadeley, vice president; William A.  Ball,  secretary;
and George W.  Hawxhurst, librarian. Advertisers whose ads helped pay for
the publication were business people from Falls Church, Leesburg, and

A strong interest in protecting native birds was formalized in  1903 when

the Virginia State Audubon Society was established in Falls Church. John 8.
Henderson was the first president.  One of the principal goals of the organiza-

tion was to promote a popular interest in bird study.  Children under sixteen

paid no dues  but signed pledge cards agreeing not to harm birds or their eggs.12
It was around this time that Joseph Harvey Riley of Cherry Hill  in Falls

Church embarked upon his life career as a renowned professional ornithologist

at the  Smithsonian.I-) A successor branch organization,  the  Fair fax Audubon

Society,  now meets monthly at the National Wildlife Federation  in Vienna.14

In  his book F&//f  C4"rc4.. j4  Vz'rgz.7».a  Vz./4ggc published in  1904,  Charles A.

Stewart noted that there were then few old houses in the village.  One comment
he wrote is of interest:  "The old big chimney house situated in the ficld oppo-

site the Odd Fellows'  Hall was built in  Revolutionary times and is probably the

oldest  dwelling  in  this vicinity."15

Stewart also wrote of the "colored settlement"  a short distance south of the

town limits, consisting of about a hundred cottages with a population between
four and five hundred.  "They have a school building and three churches and
many of the little cottages and surroundings indicate industry and thrift in the

occupants."l('

Stewart described Falls Church as the place where

d:en may  e.njay life with riatae:e, where the climate,  condueiue to refreshing

sleep,.spothes tired nerves and makes life to such again bttayant with

youthful hopes  and jays.17

A new church building and a parochial school were built in the town

between  1902 and  1906. The stone building of st. James Roman Catholic

Church was erected in  1902 and the St. James Catholic Elementary School was

built facing Broad Street in  1906. They are still located across from one anoth-

er on  spring street.I8

If any evidence was needed in  1910 that Falls Church was in at least one

regard still a sleepy little country town,  it was provided by an earlier council

ordinance passed again  that year.  In  part,  it read:  ".  .  .  It shall  not be lawful
for any person to fasten, turn at large or permit any cow,  ox, horse,  mule
or hogs or other animals to graze on any of the sidewalks or highways of the

town  .  .   ",9

Major changes were made the very next year. The Rosslyn Gas Company

was  extending its  lines to Falls  Church.20 And after years of council discussions

the decision was made to electrify the town.  Requests for bids were released but
the only response was made by Merton E.  Church,  General Manager of the
Arlington Electric Company. The council accepted his offer to buy the fran-

chise for S 10.00. The formal let-
ter of notification and accept-
ance was dated January  11,

1912.2]  After all of the years of

problems with kerosene street
lamps,  the council was surely

relieved to direct that lighting of

kerosene street lamps  be discon-
tinued at the end of April

1912.22

After lengthy discussions
had been held at many meetings

before the Falls Church town
council, it adopted on

December  14,1914,  the
Virginia state act approved

March  12,1912,  providing for

designation of segregated dis-
tricts for residence of white and

Colored  persons.23

Five men from the black
community appeared at the fol-
lowing January  1915  council

meeting protesting passage of

the segrega.tion ordinance. J.  8. Tinner,  Rev. Y. W.  Powell, Rev. J. W.  Colbert,
E.  8.  Henderson,  and G. W.  Simmons spoke on the subj.ect.24 The ordinance

Early in  1915, however,  E.  8.  Henderson had called a meeting with lead-

ing black citizens of Falls Church to oppose the proposed segregation ordi-

nance for the town of Falls Church. The group organized the Colored Citizens
Protective League  (CCPL)  and Henderson urged them to elect Joseph Tinner

pre`sident.  Later that year,  the organization  became the Falls Church and

dedicated post office  in  touJn.  Courtesy  Mrs.

Decades passed dur-

segregation and its many

inequities. An important Supreme

Court decision was  made  in  1954  call-

ing for equal opportunity in public educa-

tion.  In  1964,  the Civil  Rights Act provided the first

federal fair employment practices  law,  prohibiting discrimination on  the basis

of race, color,  religion, national origin, or sex by employers, employment agen-

cies,  and union.  Fair housing was mandated by additional  statutes. The  1915

segregation ordinance was repealed by the Falls Church City Council in

February  1999.27

The Great Tmar

he lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them

lit again in our lifetime," mused Edward Grey,  the British foreign
secretary in  1914, as diplomacy failed and war loomed.10n April 6,

1917, Congress declared war on the Central Powers.

Compulsory draft registration began in May.  Falls Church registrar George

T.  Mankin soon found himself very busy, registering  114 men by early June,  a
larger number than any other area of the county save Vienna.2

The need for land around Washington on which to conduct war activities
became acute as the war effort moved into high gear.  "SELECT OLD CAMP
ALGER,"  the Ftzz.r/zz}¢ fJc#4/J boomed, editorializing, somewhat romantically,
that "the country  [near Falls Church]  is gently rolling, well drained, and with
no nearby marshes to breed malaria. The health of the recruits would be safe-

guarded by selecting this point." Several thousand Spanish-American War vet-
erans of Camp AIger would probably have contested this point. And perhaps
they did:  the Army inspected the old camp site and rejected it in favor of land

at what became Fort Belvoir.  Had the Camp Alger site been chosen Falls
Church would have embarked on a very different course, with a giant, perma-
nent,  military base just outside town  limits.3

Consumer goods were redirected to the war front to feed soldiers and as

war materiel.  By winter  1917 Falls Church felt the brunt of mandatory

rationing as coal, an important home heating fuel, became scarce.  By early

1918 the fuel crunch was so severe that meetings were canceled so that citizens

might conserve their fuel supplies.4

Food supplies were equally problematic. J.  Parker Milburn,  the Fair fax

County food administrator,  urged citizens to observe meatless Tuesdays and
wheatless Wednesdays. Mondays later joined Wednesdays in wheatless fare, and
at least one meal of every day was to be wheatless and another meatless.  Lack

of wheat became so dire it spawned the creation of "Victory Bread," an unap-

petizing wartime recipe which county bakers were required to prepare using
alternative ingredients.  Flour and sugar soon joined the list of rationed foods,

and by April  1918 local citizens were urged to forego the use of wheat com-

pletely until at least September.  "BLOOD OR BREAK,"  read one notice in an
area newspaper.  "Others are giving their blood. You will shorten the war and

save life if you eat only what you need,  and waste nothing."5

Falls Church leaders were particularly active in supporting the war

effort. Town residents played an active role in the county War Camp
Recreation Society, assisted by the Village Improvement Society, and carried

out an ambitious fund-raising program. The Red Cross chapter in Falls

Church raised almost $2,000 during one drive, nearly three times the goal.

Local residents assisted the county Red Cross in purchasing a motorized
ambulance and motorcycle for use at the front. The Young Men's Christian

Association  (Y.M.C.A.)  directed locally by Merton E.  Church,  also raised

funds successfully.6

Americans financed the war via a series of four
Liberty Loans.  Falls Church residents committed $7,700

through their local bank during the first loan drive and

$22,000 in the second drive, with many, it was assumed,

pledging in Washington, D.C. banks,  for a much greater
total.  Each of the four local loan drives was

oversubscribed.7

Falls Church men formed a home defense league, the

Colonial Rifles, which was active throughout the war. The
town council appropriated money for uniforms, but not

guns, and the company never received rifles for all its men.
Its membership peaked at approximately forty-five.8

Yet no one in Falls Church contributed more to the

war than those men at the front. Newly-drafted soldiers
spent the first few months of the war in training camps,
and, fully seven months after Congress declared war, most
of the twenty-four Falls Church men then serving in the
armed forces were still at Camp Lee outside Petersburg,
Virginia.  Reports began returning of wounds and deaths as

local men made it to the front. Twenty-nine year old
Edward G.  Fenwick, of the University of virginia ambu-
lance corps, shot through a cheek, appears to have been the
first man wounded abroad. Stephen P.  MCGroarty, 23,

became the first Falls Church and Fairfax County ba.ttle
fatality.  He was followed by Walter L. Taverner and Ralph
Stambaugh. The terrible litany of reports of wounds and

deaths at the front would be broken only by the war's end.9

Death struck more than the soldiers. The greatest pandemic in recorded

history,  the Spanish Influenza, or, "the Flu," bred in the trenches and mass

population movements engendered by the war, attacked 40-50 percent of the
world's population, killing 22,000,000.  Unlike most viral episodes the Spanish
Flu attacked young and active adults-those cla.sses of population usually least

susceptible. Virologists believe the elderly bore antibodies developed in the late
nineteenth century when a similar, though lesser flu passed through the area-
to which younger people bore no resistance.  "Cover up each cough and sneeze;
if you don't you'll spread disease," went the popular admonition, but disease

visited Fair fax County despite public effort.  Falls Church and the portions of
the county nearest Alexandria and Washington were particularly hard hit.
Schools and churches closed and all meetings of any kind were suspended for

over a month in  October-November  1918,  until  infection rates lessened.1°
When the Armistice ended the conflict in November  1918  almost one

hundred soldiers from Falls Church,  a large percentage of its population of
fourteen hundred, were then serving.  Falls Church greeted the peace which fol-
lowed the Armistice with relief and jubilation.  Rationing was curtailed and

then ended. The flu gradually played itself out, a.nd the veterans began return-
ing from the front.  Falls Church had been a busy place during the war. Merton
E.  Church, the town banker,  noted that with "the increased number of
Government clerks and war activities in Washington the housing problem has

become very acute .  .  .  Every house in Falls Church is rented and we could rent
many more if we had them."I I  But slowly the local economy and war-weary
Falls Church returned to normal.

terrible state of area roads. The first privately owned automobile, or
"machine,"  as  they were called,  made its appearance in  Falls Church  about

1907.  It was owned by Ralph and Mabel Garland, and was top-of-the-line (it

had headlamps).  Other Falls Church inhabitants bought machines and soon

they outnumbered horses and buggies. I

At the dawn of the automobile age roads in the Falls Church area were

a detriment to travel.  "The automobile was born into a roadless world,"

according to one contemporary Washington editorialist.2 It was an era in
which  roads and highways developed by local usage and not through concerted

government policy. They bore names, not numt)ers, and were usually short-
haul.  Falls Church business leaders recognized that linking the village via good

roads with Washington would increase markets by expanding trade.

A group of visionary citizens known as the Lee Highway Association
was attempting to build a coast-to-coast highway across the southern United

States to be named in honor of Robert E.  Lee, as companion to one being
built across the northern tier of states in honor of Abraham Lincoln.3 The

genius of the Lee Highway effort was that it promised travelers a highway
bearing the same designation-then a novelty-and passable in all seasons

along  its entire length.4

Sensing an historic opportunity,  Falls  Church's preeminent citizens con-

vinced the Lee Highway Association to rcroute the proposed road through the

town.S They organized a local branch of the association to rally efforts,6 paid

substantial subscription fees,  and arranged  large-scale private financing to get
the road built.7 The road they proffered-the present Lee Highway, U.S.
Highway 29-consisted of worn-out pavement for a mile east of the village
center, while west of town between Falls Church and Fairfax Court House it
was a narrow dirt track reliable only in dry weather.8

Falls Church's gamble paid off.  Real estate agents reported "one thousand

per cent increase in sales and one hundred per cent increase in value" of prop-
erty along the new highway. Yes, Falls Church citi7.ens paid a lot of money to

garner the highway, but, according to the mollified town banker, Merton E.
Church, "WE NEVER MADE A BETTER INVESTMENT.''`)

Pleased by the commercial success of the new Lee Highway and boasting

immodestly,  "we will  not rest until  the United States  is paved,""I the Lee

Highway Association and Falls Church citizens almost immediately began

planning the route now known as Arlington Boulevard  (U.S.  Highway 50),
intending for it to pass through Falls Church. The route, also honoring Robert

E.  Lcc and called Lee Boulevard (until renamed in honor of Arlington  House,

Lee's home,  to allay the confusion)  was  never national  ill scope.  It was  to link

Washington with the new Shenandoah National Park.I I  Falls Church residents

was called until  the  1950s)  and were among its greatest financial

backers,  but the economics of increasing road frontage prevailed,

and the new road passed outside of the town limit.12

Another consequence of the advent of the personal automo-

bile was the decline of railroad  ridership. The electric trolley,  the

Washington-Virginia Railway, long linking East and West Falls
church to downtown Washington, entered a period of steep
decline and was liquidated in  1927.  Merton  E.  Church organi7.ed

the Arlington and Fair fax Railway Company, or A&F, out of its

remnants and led it energetically until  his  death  four years later.
Soon afterward, however,  the A8cF  lost its right-of-way to

Washington and,  in the face of ever-increasing automobile owner-

ship,  closed  for good  in  1939.13

The  1920s were a time of great prosperity, both in the

country at large and in Falls Church. Among the era's most
important achievements was the right of women to vote, granted

by a federal constitutional amendment in  1920.  In Falls Church
Mi`ss Mattie Gundry, proprietor of a home and school for the

mentally handicapped]  and Mrs.  P.  H.  Smyth were elected to the

town council in  1921.  Miss Gundry,  a firebrand,  bccamc well-

known for her leadership and research in national matters con-

cerning mental handicaps.14

The town council was advised of a new problem in  1920

when the electric company wrote them that it was going to bill

the town for all light bulbs broken by vandals. There were other

similar annoyances as reported by a Village Improvement Society committee in
November pointing out many depredations made by boys of the town recently.

Falls  Church's electric street lamps,  in  place only eight years,  made an  inviting
new target for youthful mayhem.15

Perhaps the most momentous event occurring during the interwar years

was the separation of East Falls Church from the town.  Until separation Falls

Church  and West Falls Church were within Fair fax County and East Falls

Church was within Arlington County.  Separation sentiment was first voiced in

1921  but little activity occurred on the question  until  1932, when  East Falls

Church citizens, citing "intolerable confusion of overlapping governmental

agencies,"  successfully petitioned the cil.cuit court for permission  to  lcavc the
town.  By court order, Arlington County wa.s required to pay 29.6 percent of
the principal and interest due on outstanding school bonds and  18  percent of

the water bonds. The eastern area of the town, containing 25  percent of its

population  and area,  30  percent of its  taxable value and  60  percent of. its stores
and businesses, was  not,  as  now,  geographically isolated  from  the rest of Falls

but lost,  and  East Falls  Church withdrew from the  town on April 30,1936.1r.

The East Falls Church business district was largely eradicated by the advent of

interstate highway 66  in  the  1970s.

The Great Depression, which defined the life and character of the times in

most other places, had but limited impact on Falls Church, where most resi-

dents held secure government jobs. Their guaranteed salaries, in turn,  meant
continued prosperity, or at least solvency, for the merchants and services in
town which supported them. The few area residents falling into harm's way

economically were helped by local citizens and organizations, which saw to  it

Deal "alphabet soup" agencies, the Works Project Administration and Public
Works Administration.  Periodic drought conditions and a more than doubling
of the town's population-from  1,007 in  1900 to 2,109 in  1930-had an
adverse effect on the level of the underground water table by which shallow

domestic dug wells and the somewhat deeper drilled wellLs were supplied.
By  1930,  failure of the water supply in the town had been  felt by 40 percent

of the 316 households. The town council contracted to deliver water to house-
holders by truck and in September and October, over 33,000 gallons were

supplied  at cost.I8

After careful  investigation, the council found that the cost of purchasing

water from Arlington County would be excessive.  On advice from a consultant

in the United States Geological Survey,  the mayor and council decided to

provide the needed water from town-drilled wells into a new central piping
system. The first of four wells was drilled on a lot behind the old First

Congregational Church, where the town's first water storage tank was built.19

By the mid-1940s, a more dependable water source was needed because

of increased demands. A connection was made with Arlington County near

Chain Bridge from which water was piped to Falls Church and the Fort
Buffalo  (now Seven Corners)  area.  By the  1950s,  now a city,  Falls Church

completed its own Potomac River crossing and a direct connection to the
Dalecarlia Treatment Plant in Maryland.  Currently,  the City of Falls Church

provides water to approximately  120,000 people in and around Falls Church.
It operates six pumping stations and nine storage  tanks strategically located

within  the service area.20

Prior to  1937, when the U.S. government gave a Public Works Admini-

stration grant to the town, each Falls Church residence had a privy or a septic

tank.  In that year, the first public sewer system was constructed after the suc-
cessful passage of a sewer bond issue by the  town's voters. As early as  1901,  the

local Board of Health had received numerous complaints of unsanitary privies

in  town  a.nd the complaints continued for decades.21

With periodic improvements to the system, the service area now includes

3,300 homes within the city and approximately 650 homes adjacent to the
city. The City's waste water is treated under contract either with Arlington
County's Four Mile Run system or Fa.irfax County's Tripps Run system.22

House to house garbage collection began  in  1937,  the fruit of a campaign

by the Falls Church Woman's Club.2.3 An equally important municipal
improvement was the incorporation of the volunteer fire department in  1925.
Education took great leaps in  1924 when the Commonwealth granted
Falls Church its own school district.  In  1926 Madison Elementary School

opened, with grades  1-7, and the venerable Jefferson Institute became a
four-year high school.

The relative affluence of Falls Church was highlighted in January  1936

when the State Theater opened.  Local pundits called it "the finest theater in

Arlington and Fairfax counties."  It seated over eight hundred,  featured a large

stage to be used for plays and public events and a lounge which could be used

for teas,  bridge  parties,  and  meetings.  Its parking lot accommodated 250  cars
and its interior was air-conditioned-an innovation not yet available in typical
homes.  ("Manufacturing its own weather throughout the year," boasted the

firm which installed the air-conditioning system.) The State's strong but sub-
dued Art-Deco  (a phrase not yet coined)

architectural motifs would bolster preserva-

tionists' successful attempts to save it from

the wrecking ball sixty years later.24

Increasing traffic on area roads during the

interwar years caused Lee Highway to be

widened to three lanes. Trees, long a major
concern in Falls Church, became a con-

tentious issue when the state highway depart-
ment announced plans to cut all the shade

trees lining Broa.d Street as part of its widen-
ing. As community opposition to the trccs
removal grew, even the Parent-Teacher
Association became involved-on the side of

the trees,  of course.  Henry G.  Shirley,  state

commissioner of highways,  issued Falls
Church an ultimatum: it could have its shade trees, or it could have a new

forty-foot road. The need to rebuild Broad Street took precedence over the
trees, which were said to be reaching the cnd of their life spans. The state high-
way department replanted the rebuilt Broad Street with pin oaks and Chinese

elms,  so Falls Church and Henry Shirley both won.25

In September  1938 a family which was to become renowned moved to the
home later known as Tallwood on East Broad Street: Milton S.  Eisenhower and

his wife,  Helen.  Di..  Eisenhower, the elder brother of Dwight D. Eisenhower,
was a high-ranking official in President Roosevelt's administration and was
known and envied for his access to the president, with whom he dined alone

frequently.26

Coming world events were to influence Falls Church and the Eis€nhowers

in ways which no one could have ima.gincd. The era of peaceful prosperity was

drawing to a close.

Mobiltz;ation and a
Second Tmorld Tmar

E rope was at war as America, still at pcacc,  cclebratcd Thanksgiving in

941.  Falls  Church's  First Church of. Christ,  Scientist,  held a `special  service
in which the text of the day was Psalms  50: 14-15-"Offer unto God

thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the m{)st High; and call upon mc in  the

day of trouble  .  .  ." The Christian Scientists and their fellow townspeople
would have been chagrined to lean how quickly they might have opportunity

to  request Divine help. I

The  bombing on  December 7,1941,  of the U.S.  Paciflc Fleet in  Pearl

Harbor,  Hawaii caused something of a panic.  One Falls Church resident cross-
ing Key Bridge into Washington December 8, the day after Pearl Harbor

noticed anti-aircraft guns hastily mounted and manned along the Georgetown
shore of the Potomac River.2

Preparations for war began immediately in Falls Church and Fair fax

County, of which the town was then still a part. The county's draft board
resumed physical  examinations  of all potential draftees.3

Consumer rationing and salvage efforts became the way of life in the area.

Rubber for automobile tires quickly became in short supply as the Japanese
assumed control of the great rubber plantations of Southeast Asia, and a

county tire rationing board was established shortly after the new year.4

As the rubber shortage became "increasingly acute"  the county rationing

I)oard obtained the draconian  power to order private vchiclcs  needing tire

scrvicing off the  roads.S

Soon  to  follow were strict rationing controls  for gasoline,  shoes,  farm

machinery  (including t)arbcd wire),  long-distance  telephone service,  stoves,

fat,  sugar,  coffee,  and processed  foods.6 Even  milk became scarce  in Virginia

during  1943.7  "Don't be a fat-waster!,"  Falls Church  inhabitants were  urged.
"Two pounds of waste  kitchen  fats contain  enough  glycerine  to  fire  5  anti-

tank guns  shells."8

The county Red Cross, headquartered in Falls Church, established a

visible presence early in the war, running frequent and highly successful cam-

paigns to collect "life-saving plasma for the Army and Navy," usually in Falls
Church Presbyterian Church.`' The Falls Church branch of the Red Cross
County Canteen Corps served breakfasts to Fair fax County men inducted into

the  armed scrviccs.10

War hysteria prompted Falls Church's town council to enact protcctivc
measures quickly. The town council chartered a civilian defense committee
which was to assist in managing the after-effects of an enemy attack on
Washington, including policing,  trafflc control, directing rcfugces, and report-

ing sabotage or cspionagc.11

Air raid wardeiis were appointed and Fair fax County's air raid warden

headquarters wcrc cstabli`shed in the Falls Church Police  Station.  By  1943  Falls

Church's aircraft ottservation post, at dakwood Cemctcry, was staffed 24 hours

a day,  7 days a week,  by 350 volunteer observers.  Occasiomlly local air raid

The Fair fax County Board of Supervisors enacted a blackout ordinance in

February  194213  and the first total  blackout took place in April. Three prison-

ers attempted to escape the county jail during the twenty-minute blackout.14

the District of Columbia it did not necessarily take part in blackouts mandated

by Richmond.16 The county's practice record was not good:  drills as late as

June  1942 earned caustic reports.17

News of the allied invasion of enemy-occupied Europe in  1944 was greeted

warmly in Falls Church, where churches held commemorative services and

rang bells  in  unison.18 Advertisers,  ever in time with  current events,  responded

by fllling local papers with jingoistic language  ("How's your invasion going?

HIS  seems  to  be doing all right  .  .  .  Buy your Invasion  Bonds today").HJ

General Dwight D.  Eisenhower stayed with his brother, Milton, in the lat-

ter's home, now Tallwood,  on  East Broad Street during part of the war.
Eisenhower, who worked eighteen-hour days, later wrote,  "I cannot remember

ever seeing their house in daylight during all the months I served in
Washington."  Helen Eisenhower always prepared the general a pot of cocoa
when he arrived home as it helped him to go to sleep.  During this time many
of Dwight's assignments were secret even from his wife,  Mamie, but Milton
learned his brother was Allied commander heading the invasion of North

Africa.  On November 8,1942,  the night of the invasion, Milton,  Helen, and
Mamie Eisenhower and several friends were playing cards in the Eisenhowers

recreation room.  Milton, knowing Dwight would announce the invasion by

radio at 9 p.in., kept the radio on during the

card game. After the invasion announcement
and the little group heard General Eisenhower's

personal statement,  Mamie was silent.  Milton
relates,  "Tears came to her eyes, but for a long

time she said nothing .  .  .  `Milton,  I am proud

of you for not telling me."20

Falls Church citizens,  meanwhile, were

fighting around the globe.  One local man

based in England wrote that "Every time you

wi.ite you mention a few more boys who are

going into the service. Must be hardly anybody
between eight and eighty left." Another, in
training in Texas, wrote,  "Will you please bake

me some cookies or a cake?"21  Donald M.

Moore was cited for bravery on Guadalcanal.22

Lytton H.  Gibson earned the Silver Star in

Italy.23  Charles 0. Triebel severely damaged
enemy shipping while commnding a subma-

rine, which earned him the Silver Star.24

Several others earned similar recognition. And Edward R.  Pierce of west Falls
Church arrested and imprisoned the poet Ezra Pound, who was the spokesman

of ltaly's  Fascist leader  Benito  Mussolini.25

Local leaders began drafting plans for reabsorbing returning servicemen into

the economy after the close of the war.26 Blackout and air raid regulations were

lifted with the fall of the Nazis in Europe,27 and in June  1945  German prison-

ers of war began working in Fairfax County agriculture and food processing
sites to hasten the delivery of food to  U.S.  troops in the Pacific. The Germans
worked for local  farmers until the local prisoner-of-war camp, a branch of a
much larger one at Front Royal, closed in November (much to the disappoint-

ment of the farmers).28

In August it was over.  Fair fax County and Falls Church greeted the news

surprisingly quietly.  Special church  services were held,  as on  "Invasion Day,"
and sirens were blown, and many businesses and government offlces closed the

next day.

farmland which surrounded the town and separated it from other settle-
Post-war prosperity wrought great changes to Falls Church. The ficlds and
cnts gave way to business development and residential subdivisions and,
by the close of the  1950s,  they were gone.  Seven Corners, one of the region's

flrst suburban  malls,  opened  in  1956.  "A quiet little country orchard  .  .  .  was

transformed overnight into the great Seven Corners Shopping Center,"I

according to interested observers.

A former slave, Frederick Foote,  Sr., had purchased about thirty-nine acres

from the Minor family following the Civil War with money he had earned
working as a blacksmith for Union  troops. The land was owned by his descen-

dants until they sold it for the new shopping center.

An instant success among shoppers, the new commercial complex quickly
reduced Falls Church's market territory-that is, the area from which shoppers
were drawn  to Falls Church-so that it now included only the city and areas
west of it. Tyson's Corner, an even larger retail development, which opened on
empty farmland to the west in  1966,  further reduced Falls Church's market ter-
ritory to what it is today-the City and immediately edj.acent environs.

Meanwhile,  Falls Church's business district rapidly expanded to create the
commercial "spines" that still exist-North and South Washington Street and
West Broad Street. The town's first strip shopping center opened in the  1000

block of West Broad Street (between West Street and the railroad crossing)  in

1948. This automobile-oriented strip center, featuring buildings separated from

the strcct by parking lots for cars, proved the prototype for future development
in Falls Church,  mirroring a nationwide trend. This and other development

added enough  new businesses to the city to warrant establishment of the

Greater Falls Church Chamber of commerce in  1946.2

An unpleasant consequence of the area's newfound reliance on the automo-

bile was the widening of washington and Broad Streets from two lanes to four
and five lanes, which necessitated cutting the shade trees lining both thorough-

fares.  Citizens objected, but the rapidly increasing population of both the
town-and city-which increased from 2,576 in  1940 to 7,535 in  1950, and
10,192 in  1960-as well as in the surrounding areas made the widcnings nec-

essary to accommodate all  the new cars plying roadways.  But this time the state

highway department did not replant the trees. West Broad Street remained bar-

ren of trees until the  1990s. And Washington Street remains unplanted. The

fate of the trees  lining these  two streets has been  a recurring question  in  town

and city life as  "growth and progress  issues"  such as strcct widenings  have

caused the  trees to be cut and replanted several  times.

Infrastructure,  in hand with the broader roadways,  made physical expan-

sion of the city possible.  Donald S.  Frady, legendary director of public works,

and his staff installed six miles of sidewalks,  twenty miles of curbs and gutters,

and many thousands of feet of storm drains within ten years of the city's cre-

ation  in  1948.3

Civic groups, the equally vital component
of any cohesive city, continued to be formed or
strengthened in post-war years. The League of
Women Voters and several neighborhood groups
representing Greenway Downs, Broadmont,  and
northern Falls Church were active in governmental

affairs, and Jaycees, Kiwanis, Lions, Veterans of
Foreign Wars, American Legion, and Boy and

Girl Scouts all provided fraternal and charitable

activities.4

During this time Falls Church inhabitants
came under the influence of two nonpartisan citi-
zens' organizations rather than of the Republican

or Democratic political parties. This was done to
comply with the provisions of the Hatch Act,
which barred federal employees from being spon-
sored by national political parties for elective

office.  Much of Falls Church's population is feder-
ally employed. The Hatch Act was recently amend-
ed to remove this restriction but Falls Church vot-

ers,  loyal to the Citizens for a Better City (CBC),
the Falls Church Citizens Organization  (FCCO),
or to the nonpartisan system itself, show no signs

of returning to more typical affiliations.

The CBC, the first of the two nonpartisan

attempt to endorse and elect to the Council pro-school candidates.5 The

FCCO's formation followed in  1988 largely in  response to land use decisions
that were not maintaining the character of Falls Church.  Since that time the
city has generally elected members from divided tickets and independent can-

ed housing fir these new citizou.  One §aech

Falls Church is unique in this country for the high number of registered

voters who participate in elections.  In the  1996 national  election over 92 per-

cent of registered voters in Falls Church cast ballots. The national average is

generally near the flfty percentile.

The Town of Falls Church was separated from the County of Fair fax and

became an  independent city of the second class by District Court order in
1948. The city's charter was granted' by the General Assembly in  1950.

Schools in Falls Church became a top priority. When the new city assumed

control of the schools from Fair fax in  1949-50, almost immcdiatcly a modern-
ization and rebuilding program was begun with a difference of opinion. To
many in the new city it seemed an extravagant use of public monies for capital

improvements and for "frills" such as music and art programs.  But to the high-

ly educated, mostly federal employees who were driving the modernization

push,  it seemed a wise use of tax dollars. The pro-modernization side won the
argument but only after more than  a decade of law suits and protracted, bitter

and divisive city elections producing radically different councils as control see-

sawed between the two sides.6

The city's independence from  Fair fax County in  1948 left it without a
high school, adequate elementary school space, and with Fair fax County
schools within its borders. This somewhat unsettled state of affairs continued
for many years, with the Falls Church High School in Falls Church attended

by Fairfax County students.  Falls Church's own junior-`senior high school,

which opened in  1952 just across the city boundary on land purchased in the
county before the annexation sul( was ]as(, was named after Vlrrinia statesman
George Mason, a name chosen from a list which included Old Dominion,
Northwestern, Columbia, Falls Church, Thomas Jefferson. MacATthur, and
Haycock. The city requested the Falrfu County School Board to change the
mme of Falls Church High, bu( i( did no(. I( later was renamed whittler and
was razed in  I 997. M(. Daniel Elementary School, also built on land just out-
side the city limit, opened in  1952. In 1955 the Oak Street School, renamed
Thomas Jefferson Elemen(ary School, was pu[chased from Falrfax CoLinry and
the venerable Jefferson lnstifu(e, the town's first public school, was closed in
1956 and demolished in 1958. For the first several years after independence
falls Church and Fairfu Couiity exchanged students until each made ami]ge-
mcnts to accommodate its own studelits.7

Segngation played a role in Fans Church's history, as i[ did throughout the

sta(e. The Commonwealth of virginia adopted a "massive resistance" polity
toward federally-directed desqpngation mcasLires in education until  1959. Falls
Church insrfuted mixed-race education two years ]a(er, in  1961, two years
behind neighboring Arlington, which instituted jt in  1959. Prior to that date
the city paid tuition to send its black elemen(ary

pupils to Fajrfax County's James I.ee Elementary
School on Annandale Road, and its black high
school pupils (o school in Mamssas.8

Separation of the races `mas also evidem in res-

idential alitas. Neighborhood covenants in some
sections of the city forbade owners from selling
their homes (o persons "of negro or negroid
descen( in aLny dngree . . ." These covenaJ)ts were
observed until  1948 when the U.S. Supreme
CouT( ruled (hem unconstitutional.9 Affican-
Americans continue to be counted among Falls
Church's notable citizens and Tinncr Hill, settled
by blacks after the Civil War, is home to descen-
dants of those oririnal families today, including
the Tinncrs and the HendeTsons.10

Recorlf trming VIllage Roots

Ihe powerful  forces of a particular brand of prosperity, progress,  and

rough the  1970s were often disrespectful of history and architecture.  In

Falls Church, lovely old homes lining North and South Washington Street and

dernization, seen in Falls Church and across the country from the  1950s

Broad Street were razed, as were the I.O.O.F.  (International Order of odd

Fellows)  Hall, Jefferson Institute,  Falls Church Bank,  Columbia Baptist

Church, and other visual and cultural landmarks in the local streetscape. They

were often replaced by architecturally undistinguished structures of predomi-

nantly utilitarian design.

But Falls Church,  finding itself at the crossroads represented by unbridled

change and tempered, selective change, chose the latter. Many jurisdictions did
not.  In  1962 planners recommended apartment towers for East Broad and
North Washington Streets. The City, after measured debate, disagreed.  In  1964

planners recommended turning downtown into an  "experimental" pedestrian
mall. This ambitious plan was in process for ten years and was formally pre-

sented in  1974. Apartment and commercial towel.s were to line the streets. The

plan is easy to dismiss now, since it was not undertaken, but numerous other

jurisdictions did  undertake similar redevelopment schemes.  Ma.ny features of
similar  1970s  urban redevelopment plans failed.I

But nothing in Falls Church's history threatened it as immediately and

physically as the interstate highway network, an outgrowth of the amazing

post-war economic prosperity in which  it shared.

President Dwight D.  Eisenhower announced plans for an interstate high-

way system  in  1956;  the Washington area segment called  for nine radial corri-

dors and three circumferential highways (beltways)  centered on Washington,

with five new Potomac RIver bridges.2 One such radial corridor, later designat-

ed Interstate  (or "I")  66, was to link the Shenandoah Valley to  the capital.`3

Falls Church lent its support to this monumental effort.  In  1955,  fully a

year and a half before the Virginia Highway Commission formally proposed 1-
66, the City Council recommended that the road be built and that the City bc

on  its  right of way.4 Additional  details caused  the council  to  rescind its early

approval:  by  1958 plans called for the new highway to pass through the City of
Falls Church along the right of way of the Washington  8c Old Dominion

Railroad.5 Its eight lanes and associated rights of way would form a corridor

300-500 feet wide.  Its interchanges would consume approximtcly [hirry acres
each.6 Over forty homes and forty businesses would be eliminated.7

The impact of this proposal-eradicating the entire West End business dis-

trict and many of the city's historic homes and residential areas-was not lost
on the council, which lobbied to have the proposed route shifted.  In  1959 the

director of the Northern Virginia Planning District Commission assured Falls
Church  residents that the route would now pass north of the city.8

Falls Church's narrow escape proved to be the opening chapter of a com-

plex story.  In Arlington,  environmentalists,  unable to  block construction

143

entirdy, caused the proposed higivay, Irfe6,
to be scaled back from eight lanes to four,
with portions below grade aTid with cmen-
sivc ]andscaping and sound barriers.9 In East
faJ]s Church, separated from the rest of
Falls Church in  1936, businesses virtun]Jy
ceased to exist after lrfe6 made its local

appearance. Many residences and its com-
mercial district, which included a movie
theater, barber shop, stores, a post office,
and doc(ors offices, were almos( en(irdy sac-
rificed to make way for the new in(erstate
higivay.'° Falls Church. itself no longer

physically thTca(ened by the higliway route,
was still kcenJy in(crested in the issue. City
officials viewed the new highway as a bypass
arotind the tTafficcholnd (owii. "Perhaps
Falls Church's most obvious curse is traffic,"
said one, hcanily endorsing the roadway. 8 I
Balancing the needs of automobile traps-

pomtion against the quality of life incmasingiv consumed public debate jn
Falls Church as i( adjusted to exis(once in a rapidly-burgeoning urban aJca.

Falls Church's downto\rm became less intimate than before when the streets
which in(crscct there were widened (o four and five lanes. Overhead pedestriai]
walkways vere recommended for (hc intersection of Broad and Wching[on
Streets by a consultan( who noted in  1967, "It's worth your life to try (o cross
there on foot."12 Bu( Falls Church, tl]rough carrful stroe( ornamentation ai]d
cmsswalk trca(ment, has managed to preserve its downtown as a place where

Tcstau[an( patrons dine ourdoors and residents and visitors interact.

Suburbs, as Gertrude Stein said, are the place where "there is no A4|rir
there."13 "Falls Church may be a city by name and a metropo]i(all subul
by locale, l]ut it has the hcalt and soul of a vi]]agr," according to one life-

President John  F.  Kennedy was quick to cable,  "Warmest congratulations

to  Falls  Church, Virginia,"  in  1962  as  the city learned that its progressive civic

program sccurcd it the AIl-America City award from the National Municipal
League and foo4 magazine. The city showed "noteworthy accomplishments
through alert, continuing citizen pa.rticipation.  Such is the only way to make

self-government effective," according to contest judges, who praised the city's

nonpartisan  atmosphere.16

One of the most effective protectors of the village legacy has been the Falls

Church Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS), the  1965  suc-

cessor to  the  1885-1919 Village Improvement Society.  It was a VPIS  study

which originally suggested replanting trees on Broad Street,  and its work in

preserving the tree canopy, conserving the stream valleys,  and encouraging judi-
cious landscaping using native plant species has been  invaluable in preserving

the city's natural character.  Its popular concerts in Cherry Hill Park and in
homes around the city have added immeasurably to the cultural milieu.

"The beautiful historic homes

and sites we enjoy today have a

way of becoming gas stations,
hamburger stands, and high-rises
that we must endure tomorrow,"
wrote Stewart W.  Edwards of
Historic Falls Church,  Inc.,  a
nonprofit corporation formed in

1975  to encourage  restoration and

administer preservation Case-

ments.17 In  1984  the Council

enacted a zoning ordinance desig-

nating the entire city as an his-

toric overlay district,  giving

homes and buildings built in or

before  1910 special protection
from demolition.  Remembrance

and preservation of the past are

essential ingredients in the life of

any village.

iumcrous examples of user-friendly services  in practically every Falls
Church city government department.  Helpful staff members make con-
Efective government involves clear understanding of expectations. There are

tacts pleasant even when they include paying taxes.

Joint ventures are shared with  neighboring jurisdictions. The city govern-

ment cooperates with the Arlington County government in providing commu-
nity-based group homes for court-sponsored programs for teenage boys a.nd

girls who need emphasis on personal responsibility,  independent judgment, and

positive change. Argus House,  on Clarendon Boulevard in Arlington, opened
in  1976 and Aurora House on South Maple Avenue in Falls Church opened on

April 7,1991. The Friends of Argus and Aui.ora Houses support extra projects

and the Susan L.  0lom Scholarship Fund encourages house residents to attend

college.I

Through the Housing and Human Services Division, programs are provid-

ed for families,  senior citizens,  people with disattilities and residents  in crisis.

These and other services are available from the city or in cooperation with

Arlington or Fair fax counties.2

Priorities had been strongly established after the circuit court judge granted

Falls Church city of the second class status in  1948 and the General Assembly

granted its charter in  1950. The city built two schools:  George Mason Junior-
Senior High School west of Haycock Road, and Mount Daniel Elementary at
the end of Oak Street; both were opened in  1952. The City purchased Oak

Street School from Fair fax County in  1955  and renamed it Thomas Jefferson
Elementary School. All school buildings had subsequent additions and renova-

tions. The first section of the brick city hall was opened in  1958,  as was  the

flrst section of the library building.J So were schools, government, and the

library served.

All of the Falls Church public schools and one private school have been

nationally recognized as exemplary learning centers. In  1982-83, George

Mason High School received one of the first Excellence in Education awards
from the United States Department of Education. Mount Daniel and Thomas

Jefferson Elementary Schools received the Excellence in Education award in
1986,  a.nd  in  1998,  George Mason Middle School  received a Blue RIbbon

award for excellence in education. Also in  1998, the Virginia Tech/University
of virginia Northern Virginia Center on Haycock Road formed a partnership
with George Mason High and Middle Schools for a technology learning

center.4 The only private school in Northern Virginia to receive the award that

year, St. James Catholic School in Falls Church, was named a Blue Ribbon
School for  1998-99 by the U.S.  Department of Education.  It was one of the
Blue Ribbon Schools named nationwide for the school year and was cited for
"academic excellence, parental involvement and community support." The

school population in  1998-99 at St. James Catholic School,  kindergarten

through eighth grade, was 625.5

Schools have had an important place in the Falls Church community for
decades. As Falls Church Public School Supcrintendcnt Mary Ellen Shaw wrote

in  1999:

Since its inception in  1949,  the  Falls Church City  inde|iendent School

systenii has  prodeced a concrete measure of its excellence in the form of a

coritinttous §tredm of well-edrcated graduates ...,  Buildings  have  been

renovated and new Staff hired.  Neu) I)rograms  have  been introdaeced, Xerox

machines, VCRs and com|)uteri  have replaced Pur|]le ditto md$1;ers, film

Strip |]rojector§ and typeu)riter§.  But one thing htts remained the Sdme-the

commitment of the commiAnity drid the §t¢ff to  provide the  best possible

education to all of the Students in the  Pal:l§ Church City I>ttblic Schools.6

In  the  initial  1998-99  city budget,  the schools'  appropriation  amounted  to

S 14,246,683,  74.50 percent of the total city budget.  Appropriations for school

purposes have traditionally represented a high percentage of the annual budget
for Falls Church. The public school population for  1998-99 was  1,062 stu-

dents for kindergarten through eighth grade, and 505 students for ninth

through twelfth grades.7

Since the Falls Church Community Center was opened in  1968  under the

direction of Ken Burnett,  it has filled a large variety of needs for the city and
its environs throughout the year and offered numerous opportunities for the

constructive use of leisure time. The center,  now under director Howard
Herman,  hosted citizens' groups, health groups, scout groups, athletic clubs,

military historians, recyclcrs, the Victorian Society, and garden clubs, some of

the organizations that met in  1999 in the Community Center on a regular
basis.  Other special events were held in the Community Center's large gymna-
sium and in Cherry Hill park.9

In  1999,  the city of Falls Church was named a Tree City USA for the

twenty-first year in a row.  Under the direction of arborist Shirley Street,  the
successful program meets four requirements: a community tree board or

depa.rtment, a tree care ordinance, a comprehensive community forestry pro-

gram, and an Arbor Day observance.  National sponsors of the Tree City USA
program are the Arbor Day Foundation, the Forest Service,  and the Association
of State  Foresters.1°

The recycling program in Falls Church began in the  1970s when the city
became the first in the region to offer curbside recycling of newspapers to the

residents. With the establishment of the "green bin"  program in  1990 and the
Falls Church Recycling Center in  1991, a wide variety of materials is now col-
lected on a regular basis.  Citizen volunteer involvement and youth education

programs reaching hundreds of elementary school students have provided
opportunities to take part in environmental awareness and action in the com-
munity.  In  recognition of its strong recycling program,  Falls Church is one of

only nineteen communities across America to be included in an EPA docu-

rrL€ITt, Cutting tlJe Vma§te Stream in  Halfi  Community Record Setters Show  Hou).

After using open dump sites and a sanitary land fill established by Fair fax
County in  1973, Falls Church has relied on Fair fax County for disposal of its

solid waste.  Nearly all such material collected in  the city is  now incinerated at

the I-95  Energy/Resource Recovery Facility in  Lorton.1l

Vice President Albert Gore issued a National Recycling Challenge on

November  16,1998, asking citizens to renew their commitment to conserve

our national  resources by recycling.  Under the City's Recycling Coordinator,

Annette Mills, and with active and enthusiastic citizen participation, Falls

Church received the nation's highest rating-67 percent a year later in  1999,
forty points above the national average.

As City Manager Louis  Z. Johnston, Jr.  wrote in  1961 :

.  .  It is on the basis of its contribution to the chanlcter of the city ac
a;h.Ore-;;;;;;;;;;;:;;;t-:;;;if`;;';;';;;;i;;:;;i;';;;i;;.i::[;'6;#fJrto
be a great city in the sense of Square miles occapied.  But Falls Church  can

be, and is u)ell on its u)ay to  becoming, a great city in the sense of offering

a fine Place in which to  live and u)orb. The city is match more than its

government:  it is homes, churches,  organizations dedicated to §erulce,  and
businesses operated efficiently yet u)ith a strong Sense of the |>ttblic interest;

it is the way in which neighbors and even rivals work together in common

Purpe§e.  But a Sen§e Of udlue and of civic |jurpose cannot operate withottt
the Solid foundation of good government and public service. This is the

responsibility of the City Mdndger, the Saperintenderit of Schools, and

other officials and civil §erudnts. W:e u)ant all our citiacns to understand

uihdt we are trying to do; to  be frond t;o §ttggest ujay§ in which we can

§erue better or more economically; and to surpport our effort to mdhe Fdll§

Throughout history,  Falls

Church has been a crossroads, with
its people and that of the region
often  returning to a common
theme of how to maintain and
improve the movement of people

and freight from one place to

another. The Tricentennial year was
no different.  Representing the City,
Mayor David Snyder participated
in creating the Northern Virginia

Early in  2000,  the City unveiled its  new bus  transit system which is a part-

nership of the City and Fcdcral,  State and regional government, Virginia Power

and the Metro system. The twenty-two seat electric/diesel hybrid experimental

vehicles will link residential and business areas  better to  the rail stations.  In

addition to the state-of-the-art technology, the system will operate on different

da.ily schedules to better serve  the needs of commuters,  school children,  senior

citizens,  employers  and employees. Yet again,  improving transportation is occu-

pying the minds of the City's leadership and citizens  as  it has  repeatedly
throughout the three hundred years of the community's history.

The Falls Church
Tricenteunial Celebration

In September  1992,  the Board of Directors of the Village Preservation and

Improvement Society propo.sed a commemoration of the 300th anniversary
in  1999 of the settlement of the community in  1699. This date was selected

on the basis of a verbal account of a stone bearing the date "1699" on a chim-

ney in the "Big Chimneys"  house which once stood near the present-day inter-

section of Little Falls  Road and Broad Street in  Falls Church.

The Falls Church Tricentennial Committee was selected by the City

Council in  1993  to develop plans for a year-long celebration in  1999.

Committee members appointed were Ben Birindelli, Joyce Gory, Barbara
Cram, Ron Crouch, Susan Earman,  David Eckert, Merni Fitzgerald, Edna
Frady, Rosemary Haynes Jones, John Rodock, Kieran Sharpe, and Maurice

Terman.  Staff liaisons were Diane Morse, Barbara Cordon, Deane Dierksen,
Nancy Birindelli, and Daughters of the American Revolution members Marie
Yochim and Doris Katz.  During several years of meetings a tentative schedule,

month by month, was laid out.  In  1998, a Publications Subcommittee signed a
contract with the Donning Company of virginia Beach to produce this picto-
rial history of the settlement, hamlet, village, town, and city from Indian times
through December 31,1999. Two Falls Church authors,  Bradlcy Gernand and
Nan Netherton, were chosen by Donning to research, write,  and collect graph-

ics,  a process begun  in spring  1997.

The Tricentennial Committee deemed it necessary to have a special logo

for the observance and a contest was held. The winning design was done by Pat
Algie of the City's staff. It was used on  numerous banners and printed materi-

als. Additioml ideas were developed.  More than a dozen cachet envelopes with
maps and pictures were authorized by Falls Church Postmaster Joseph

Quinones,  assisted by his staff person,  Patsy Mitchell. These individually illus-
trated envelopes were designed by artist Barbara Cram and others and specially

canceled at different times during the year for stamp collectors and other inter-

ested individuals.  Over one  thousand were sold t]n  December 31,1999,

Tricentennial Eve. This was the first time the U.S.  Postal service had produced

such a series with special cancellations.

Other souvenirs included ceramic crocks marked with ``Falls Church"  and
the number "300", designed by potter Walt Zotter. Wallets filled with printed

play money were negotiable with various local merchants.  Golf shirts and pins
were also available for sale.  Sets of free bookmarks wcrc printed with brief his-

tories of individual schools or churches and made available at the public

library.  Historic maps of the city were designed, printed, and distributed free to

residents  and visitors.

Many individuals and groups gave time,  talent, and imagination  to the

planning and implementation of the year's numerous cvcnts.  In addition to the
leadership of the Tricentennial Committee, the following organizations partici-

pated:  the Historical Commission, the Village Preservation and Improvement
Society,  the Victorian  Society at Falls  Church,  the Falls  Church Public Schools,

169

the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation,  the City Manager's offlce and other City
offices, the Library Board,  Daughters of the American Revolution,  Recreation
and Parles,  neighborhood groups, the Grcatcr Falls Church Chamber of
Commerce,  the Economic Development Authority, the Police Department, the
American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars veteran's organizations, several

civic organizations,  and merchants of good will. The efforts of all participants

helped to produce memorable shared experiences among the citizens of Falls

Church, their children,  and guests during the Tricentennial year of 1999.

Festivities began on New Year's Eve,  December 31,1998, an unusually

cold and windy night. The "Crossroads in  History,"  Broad and Washington
Streets,  informally dubbed "Timeless Square"-were transformed into a pedes-
trian walkway as through traffic was rerouted around the area. Thousands of

celebrants, all bundled up, enjoyed music and other entertainment as they vis-

ited busincsses and churches whose doors had been opened for the occasion,

some with historical displays. An outdoor stage was used by music groups.

Restaurants and street vendors provided hot and cold drinks and welcome
warm food.  During the month of January  1999 which followed,  both the Falls

Church Chamber Orchestra and the U.S.  Navy Ba,nd presented special con-
certs in the George Mason High School auditorium.

The January theme of "Crossroads in History" was followed by the
February theme of "Government." Two Leadership Round Tables were held,
one at George Mason High and the other in the Council Chamber at City
Hall. The 50th Anniversary of the City Schools was commemorated with a
special music program presented by the fourth and fifth grades, at George

Mason  High auditorium. At the City's first "Harambce" celebration in
February, Black History month was recognized in an appropriate way.  It was

announced that City Council members had repealed by resolution on February
22,1999, the segregation ordinance which had been passed by the Town

Council in  1915  in  an effort to separate races  into different residential areas

within the corporate limits. A City Hall Open House extended a special invita-

tion to citizens  to visit local government offices.

Special recognition of the importance of "Volunteers and Organizations"

was given in March honoring the more than sixty active civic and church

groups in the City. An organizational Information Fair was held at the
Kemper-Macon Ware Masonic Lodge No.  64 in mid-March and included the

presentation of a special bust of virginia colonial statesman George Mason to
the city to be placed in front of City Hall. AIl schools observed one Old

Fashioned Day at City schools and the first grades gave a 50th anniversary

presentation of the schools musical program at George Mason High.

April was the month to celebrate "Natural and Cultural  Resources." The
first Falls Church Arbor Day-first in the state of virginia as well-was held at
the Jefferson Institute in  1892. The commemorative observance was held near

the old site in Frady Park. The  100th anniversary of the Mary RIley Styles  Falls

Church Library was celebrated on April  18 with speakers, birthday cakes, bal-
loons, and flowers. A youthful bagpiper and an enthusiastic Barber Shop

Quartet performed in appropriate costumes. The Cherry Hill Fa.rm House
offered special tours featuring the life of Mary RIley Styles.

"History on Parade" was the theme for May.  Civil War Living History

groups demonstrated at the Thoma.s Jcffcrson School's playing ficld. And at a
dedication of Civil War Trails by the City Council, "Fort Taylor" Park at Seven

Corners was officially recognized as a significant location on  the Virginia Civil

War Trails map.  It commemorates the first use of balloons at that site during

the Civil War under the direction of Professor Thaddeus Lowe for purposes of

costumes enhanced a Victorian Ball held at Thomas Jefferson School and a spe-
cial tea was given at Cherry Hill Farm House. A few days later, the Falls
Church Chamber Orchestra presented a concert at George Mason High.  In

addition to other selections, a special work commissioned and written in honor
of the Tricentennial by composer Thomas Schouber was given its inaugural

performance. The final public event of the month was the annual Memorial
Day Parade,  the 3-K Fun Run, and all-day activities in the City Hall-Cherry
Hill Complex.  Falls Church civic leader Louis Olom was designated the Grand

Marshal of the parade.

The theme chosen by the Tricentennial committee for June was

"Celebration of People." The Tinner Hill Street Festival celebrated the African-

American community and their cultural activities. Also, a large crowd was in
attendance that month to honor Deane Dierksen at her retirement party at
Cherry Hill for her service to the community as director of the Mary Riley

Styles Public Library of Falls Church. An elaborate reenactment of an actual
Victorian wedding was held t]y the Victorian Society at the Abbott house with

almost one hundred "guests"  in costumes of the period. Music was played and
elaborate refreshments were served under the ancient shade trees on the lawn.

Later that month, school afflliations were remembered with reunions and pic-
nics for both the George Mason High School alumni and the public school
staff with several teachers attending who taught at Madison School in  1949. A
large reunion for the classes in the  1960s was held at the State Theater and an

all-class picnic at Cherry Hill Park was held on Saturday, June 26.

A broad definition of "Recreational Pursuits" served as July's central theme.

On July 4, The Falls Church  (Episcopal)  held a special colonial church service
followed by an audience participation in the reading aloud by many individuals

of the original wording of the Fair fax Resolves, the Virginia Declaration of

RIghts, the Declaration of Independence, and the Federal Bill of Rights. A fire-
works show was given that evening at George Mason High's athletic field.

During July a.nd part of August, outdoor evening concerts sponsored by the
Village Preservation and Improvement Society were held in Cherry Hill Park
behind the old barn. The audiences, many of them families with children,
brought blankets and chairs or sat on the grass under the trees to enjoy the
"music in the air." A special program was held in July commemorating one of

two District of Columbia Jurisdiction Stones located on Falls Church's borders.
The No. 9 Boundary Stone near Van Buren Street had been declared a
National Registered Landmark in  1980 and was mmed after the black mathe-
matician and astronomer,  Benjamin Banneker, who assisted Andrew Ellicott in

laying out the entire ten-mile-square encompassing land in Maryland, the
District of Columbia, and Vlrginia. The other stone is the West Cornerstone
located at the joining of Arlington County,  Fair fax County, and the City of
Falls Church on Meridian Street. This stone has been recently named, by

agreement of the three jurisdictions,  in honor of Andrew Ellicott, chief survey-

or of the ten-mile-square of the  Federal  District in  1791  and  1792.  Isaac
Crossman park on Four Mile Run was also dedicated that day.

"Happy Birthday, Falls Church!" was the Tricentennial theme in August. A

well-attended public concert with the Falls Church Chamber Orchestra and
Irish dancers and a ceremonial cutting of the cake were held in Cherry Hill
Park.  On the fifteenth, a dedication of the supposed site of the "Big Chimneys"
was followed by a "Church and Tavern Day in  1763" a week later presented by
Falls Church City and organized by the Historical Commission. A meeting of

the Truro Parish Vestry was recreated around the old Anglican church and there

171

were many purveyors, artisans, and colonial period reenactors.  Gingerbread

and root beer were served and George Washington himself made an appearance
in a.n appropriate costume.  Gathering and mingling among the visitors were

story tellers,  musicians, dance masters,  toba.cco farmers, leather workers, gun-

smiths, weavers, wood crafters, blacksmiths, herbalists, quilters, sampler mak-

ers,  embroiderers, and Native American traders.

In September, following the traditional summer vacations, students

returned to school and business people geared up for their fall and holiday

activities. The month's theme was "City Schools and Businesses." The quilters

took their Bill of Rights quilt to a Council meeting to have it rededicatcd and
arranged to have it permanently mounted on display in the Council Chamber.
Open House was held at one of the community's oldest businesses,  Brown's
Hardware. An all-day Falls Church  Fa,ll Festival was held in Cherry Hill Park
on the eighteenth. The Falls Church Chamber Orchestra held its third
Tricentennial concert at George Mason High the following day. The month
ended with  the meaningful dedication of Tinner Hill Memorial Arch in a

pocket-park at the corner of South Washington Street and Tinner Hill.  It was
the culmination of persistent efforts by members of the Tinn€r Hill Memorial
Foundation, the Falls Church City Council, elected government representa-

tives, other individuals, merchants, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. A matching grant from the Commonwealth
of virginia, obtained largely through the efforts of Falls Church's Delega.te
Robert Hull, helped to fund the building of the pink marble arch. This struc-
Cure was to commemorate the founding of the flrst rural chapter of the
NAACP in the United States. The chapter was organized in  1915  in the Town
of Falls Church.  Land on Tinner Hill has been set aside by Falls Church and
Fair fax County for a future cultural heritage center.

The October theme was "Homes and Hearth." A two-day Private Homes

Tour of eleven buildings and one garden was held the first weekend in
October, sponsored by VPIS and the Victorian Society. The following weekend
there was a well-attended Farm Day at Cherry Hill Park. An exhibit of
Victorian clothing took place at Cherry Hill. A Family Sock Hop da,nce was
held at George Mason High.  Cherry Hill  Farm House was the location for lit-
erary evenings of readings to commemorate the  100th anniversary of the
founding of the Falls Church Library.

"Places of worship" was the major theme in November. An ecumenical

religious service was held on Veterans'  Day, November  1 I  at which time a

Veterans' Honor Roll Plaque was unveiled with lists of names of all of the com-
munity's service people who lost their lives in the nation's wars.  Information for

this plaque was painstakingly collected by a number of dedicated community
activists. An annual tradition was repeated during Thanksgiving week-the
showing of the classic  1946 film,  "It's a Wonderful Life," starring James

Stewart, at the Community Center. Local schools received close attention in a
November symposium entitled "The Future of Education."

"The City of the Future" was December's theme and a leadership Round

Table on the subject was held on December 7 in the newly remodeled State
Theater.  Entertainment began early in the evening with the classic rock and

roll sounds of the David Elliott Band. Then a panel of experts on the local
economy, design and development trends,  the environment, dcmographics and

government voiced their opinions on the future of Falls Church over the next
century. A Holiday Ball was held at the Community Center on  December  I 1
and on New Year's Eve,1999, a closing ceremony of the Tricentennial Year was

held in "Timclcss Square" at the City's main crossroads with merriment and

172

music. All that remained to be completed in the formal observance were two
things.  One was the dedication of a new plaque by the Village Preservation and
Improvement Society in the I'resident's Garden under the W & OD  Bike Trail
Bridge in the West End of the City off Broad Street naming and honoring past

presidents of the Society. The other task was to work with collecting certain
objects for a Time Capsule commemorating the Tricentennial Year. The kinder-

garten students in the class of 2012 were asked to participate with the preserv-
ing of the capsule at Mount Daniel Elementary School and marking it with a

plaque directing that it be opened in  the year 2050.

There are more than  forty memorials, plaques, and historical markers
which have at different times been placed throughout the City of Falls Church.
Some of the parks and streets have special names. They commemorate people,

events, buildings,  and early sites of importance in the growth and development
of the community. A current list may be seen in the Local History Room of
the Mary RIley Styles Library of Falls Church.

Gernand moved to Falls Church in 1990, where he serves on the library board of
trustees and has served on the historical commission and Falls Church Jaycees. He is the
next-door neighbor of Robert Pogorzelski Matthews, a lifelong resident of Falls Church,
who graciously tended to Gernand’s many outdoor chores, without being asked, to pro-
vide the coauthor additional time in which to work on this book—‘“the embodiment of

what makes Falls Church unique among places,” according to Gernand.

An original copy of the 12-page program provided to all who participated in an October 1952 three-day dedication of the next George Mason High School campus in Falls Church was stumbled upon late last week and was shared via the school’s website.

As citizens of Falls Church today are faced with the responsibility of voting on a $120 million school bond referendum next month for a new George Mason High, the vivid reminder of the 65-year-old dedication of the original school footprint has underscored the importance of the upcoming vote. Vice Mayor Marybeth Connelly, who came across the original program, posted it on the daily morning briefing site for the schools this week.

Falls Church citizens of that era were clearly very proud of their new school, as a perusal of the the Dedication Ceremony program makes clear. The dedication was billed as “A Festival of Progress,” and celebratory events ran from Friday night through midday Sunday.

After the City of Falls Church was incorporated as an independent city in August 1948, and therefore totally responsible for its own school system, one of the first moves was a voter approval of a $700,000 bond referendum in 1949 authorizing the purchase of 25 acres at the corner of Leesburg Pike and Haycock Road and more acreage at what became the Mt. Daniel Elementary.

The cost of the land purchase by the City was $40,000 and the high school was designed to accommodate 325 students, including 22 full-time and five part-time teachers. (Today, the bond referendum on the ballot next month is for $120 million and 10 acres of the school land is valued at $40-45 million. The new high school would accommodate 1,650 students).

Construction of the new school was delayed when a major backlash erupted in the City leading in 1951 to overturning of the City Council and to the resignation of six of the seven members of the then-appointed School Board. in 1951.

But the new George Mason Junior/Senior High School was eventually completed and opened for grades 6 to 12 in 1952. Its design plans had been acclaimed as among the top 14 of over 200 entries from school systems across the U.S. but a shortage of funds offered by the new City Council delayed the completion of a larger footprint, and from its opening classes had to be held in the gym, for example.

A lot of what needs fixing at the high school now are materials and components that were part of the original 1952 construction.

The October 10-12 dedication as a “Festival of Progress” was proclaimed in the program by Falls Church Mayor Charles E. Kellogg, who invited all citizens of the community to “participate in this festival as good neighbors and friends, remembering with humility our debt to the past, cherishing with pride our present achievements, and facing the future of our city, state and nation with confidence and unity.”

Fifty-six original patrons of the festival included such groups as the Greater Falls Church Citizens Association, Page Hughes Buick, the Lions Club and Kiwanis, Robertson’s 5 and 10 Cent store, Goot’s Linoleum, Bunny Gibson’s Seafood Market, Horace E. Brown, the Chamber of Commerce, Falls Church Community Theater, the Cherrydale Cement Block Company, the Falls Church Womens Club and City founding father Claude Wells, after whom the City Hall was later named. The program’s illustrations were the work of students Kasha LaRew, Marylou Taylor and Roberta Rucker.

The events began with a citywide dance in the school gym (still there, now known as ‘The Pit’) and on Saturday they commenced with a parade from Cherry and Broad west on Broad to the school site.

Outdoor ceremonies began at 2 p.m., with the groundbreaking for the new addition by School Superintendent Irvin H. Schmitt and School Board chair John A. Johnson.

Future F.C. Mayor Herman L. Fink was among the keynote speakers along with Virginia State Sen. John A. K. Donovan.

On Sunday, the events continued with “a pilgrimage of historical places in the City of Falls Church” sponsored by the Falls Church chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Members of the Falls Church School Board then were Johnson, Oliver Caldwell, Richard Saintsing, Daniel Stapleton, H. P. Strope, Francis W. Trapp and John W. Wells.

In addition to Fink, another future mayor, Charles Hedetniemi, was an officer of the high school PTA and future mayor Lee Rhoads was on the dedication committee.

The program included a statement congratulating the clergy and congregation of the St. James parish on the completion of its new parish, and suggested that “everyone go to the church of his choice on Sunday, Oct. 12, to thank almighty God for his blessings which have inspired our Festival of Progress.”

A robust drawing of the school mascot, the Mustang, up on its hind legs, filled out the program for the event.

But the most momentous individual listed in the program was Johnson, chair of the School Board. The general counsel to the Air Force, he was the only member of the School Board who did not resign in 1951, and went on to spearhead the City schools’ integration efforts following the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Brown Vs. Board of Education in 1954.

Leading the effort over the reluctance of other members of the School Board, he championed the effort in the 1950s such that the Falls Church schools eventually became only the second district in Virginia to integrate, though not until the early 1960s.

In 2005, on the occasion of the dedication of the new Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School, the News-Press tasked reporter Darien Bates with an extensive research project that led to a two-part series in September 2005 spelling out a detailed history of how the Falls Church City schools were integrated. It included interviews with Lou Olom and the late Jessie Thackrey.

It was then that Johnson’s seminal role was first and decisively documented.

Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board\n\n![Picture of FCNP.com](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/07232714/FCNPLogo.svg)\n\n#### FCNP.com\n\n[2005-10-06](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/)in[News](https://www.fcnp.com/category/c20-news/)\n\nRight in the City of Falls Church, imagine cross burnings in your front yard, or having rotten fruit thrown at you as you picket in front of the State Theatre. And imagine being the one black student at George Mason High School with classmates who hate you just for the color of your skin, who want you to go back to your school and forget about equal rights.\n\nMarian Costner experienced this 41 years ago as she became the first black student to graduate from George Mason, following its landmark integration in 1961, the opening stages of the struggle for which was documented in the first part of this series last week.\n\nTo get to a place where she could stand as a George Mason graduate, Falls Church had to go through a series of changes, shedding a mottled Virginia history of segregation, and slavery over a period of 10 years to take on the mantle of equal rights.\n\nLast week, Part One of this exclusive _Falls Church News-Press_ series described the events in Falls Church in the first years following the Brown Vs. the Board of Education decisions, including the efforts of F.C. School Board chair John A. Johnson. But though Johnson worked arduously starting in 1955 to integrate the schools, that champion ended up leaving the City before seeing the change he had hoped and worked for.\n\nThis second article recounts how the schools finally desegregated in 1961, and the travails of Costner and what she faced as the first African American student to attend the City’s George Mason High School.\n\n**A Changing Tide**\n\nIn the years of Virginia’s “massive resistance” to the Supreme Court’s decision on Brown Vs. Board II, beginning in 1956, there was little local jurisdictions in the commonwealth could do on their own to end segregation. A “Dillon Rule” state, Virginia’s constitution prohibited local jurisdictions from doing anything not specifically permitted by the state, an anomaly that exists to this day. In 1956, the state established a “pupil placement board” to ensure that state control to maintain segregation. It held sway over all decisions about where students could attend school. Any locality that attempted to go against its decisions was threatened with the loss of state funding and more.\n\nWhile integration had been stalled by the state, however, those efforts could only delay integration, not prevent it. As the commonwealth plumbed the legal depths to find a way to stop the rising tide, little by little, moves toward integration were happening around the state.\n\nEven though the City of Falls Church was prohibited from making any direct headway to desegregate, there was an evolution happening in the City that would ultimately prove important when the opportunity to integrate finally arose again.\n\nAs stated in Part One of this series, during the majority of the 1950s, the government of the City of Falls Church was led by a group of conservative councilmen who had come to power in the election of 1951 and subsequently kept the reins on the City for nine years. Without a concerted effort from more progressive citizens, who had originally helped establish the independent city, conservatives managed to win election after election to the Council.\n\nBut in 1959, a decade after Falls Church had first seceded from Fairfax County to become an independent city under Virginia law, a group of residents formed a civic organization called the Citizens for a Better Council, later known as the Citizens for a Better City, or the CBC. It was modeled on the “Arlingtonians for a Better County” in adjacent Arlington County, maintained as a non-partisan civic association in order not to violate federal law prohibiting federal employees from being involved in partisan politics. The first president of CBC was Lou Olom, whose own children attended the Falls Church schools and whose primary focus was on the quality of those schools.\n\nEstablished in early 1959 and learning as it went, the CBC set its sights on the June elections of that year, backing candidates Charles J. Hedetniemi, Everett D. Johnston and Lee M. Rhoads to contest for the three seats up for election. Composed of both Democrats and Republicans, the group championed the cause of the schools, which it felt was being under funded by the presiding administration.\n\nOver the previous two years, the City Council had taken several actions to cut money to the schools. In 1957 it prevented a referendum on a bond for high school expansion, despite 1,200 of the City’s 10,000 residents signing a petition. The Council subsequently replaced all the School Board members who had recommended passage the referendum (School Board members were appointed by the Council back then).\n\nThe next year, the Council and the School Board voted together to take the seventh grade out of George Mason and place it in the elementary school in an effort to try to get around the need for a larger high school, over the protests of many.\n\nIn an editorial in the June 8, 1959 edition of the _Washington Post_, on the eve of the Falls Church City Council election, the paper laid out the two sides, one representing, as it described, “the needs of a modern community,” and comparing the other to a kind of “medieval government.” The editorial said that the schools and the City’s reputation were at stake in the 1959 election.\n\nEven though the issue of integration remained largely out of the public discussion, it was lurking in the background. As schools all over the South fought, and increasingly lost, the fight against integration, it was clear to those defending the conservative platform in Falls Church that a change in the City Council could mean a change in integration policy, as well.\n\n“It was never stated publicly, but it was all over the place,” Olom said. He added that there were many who weren’t too worried about integration, but those that “did give a hoot knew, and they spread the word.”\n\nOne member of the Falls Church School Board in 1959, in particular, was a supporter of the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties, a group formed in the wake of the Brown Vs. Board decision dedicated to maintaining segregation, even to the point of closing schools, as had happened in Virginia ‘s Prince Edward County .\n\nIn the election of June 9, 1959, with a solid show of support from the citizens of Falls Church, all three CBC candidates won seats on the City Council. But with the three victories, the CBC was still a vote shy of having control over the seven-member Council. However, prior to the election, a member of the existing council, Charlie Hailey met with the CBC and came to an agreement with the CBC leadership that if it won, he would be willing to take their side as long as they voted for him as mayor.\n\nThe CBC agreed and when the Council took office after the election, it ended up in control of the Council by a four-to-three margin, with the assistance of Hailey as mayor.\n\n“He sensed that the atmosphere was changing,” Olom said.\n\n**Another Chance**\n\nHailey’s decision meant that the City, which for nine years had been heading in one direction, suddenly performed an about-face just as integration was once again becoming a front-burner issue.\n\nIn 1961, in its continued effort to resist federal pressure to integrate schools statewide, Virginia adopted a fall-back “local option” policy. The policy allowed localities to petition for the right to decide student placement.\n\nIn order to take advantage of the change, each individual school board had to vote to recommend to their City Council that it apply for exemption from the State Pupil Placement policy. The Council then had to vote to approve that recommendation before the state would cede power to the locality.\n\nThe procedure was meant to create prohibitive complications for local governments and give individuals at the local level the power to stem integration. But though intended to delay desegregation, in Falls Church the change meant that the newly elected Council members could take the first steps towards integrated schools.\n\nFollowing the example of Arlington County, which integrated almost immediately after the passage of the new policy, Falls Church began the process to regain local control over pupil placements.\n\nHaving failed twice before to integrate when this new opportunity first arose, it was unlikely that the CBC-controlled City Council would miss this chance, especially when its Arlington neighbors already succeeded.\n\nIn the year following the Council election, the School Board underwent an overhaul as the new Council replaced conservative School Board members when their terms expired with others eager to develop new educational ideas in Falls Church and also looking to finally integrate the schools.\n\n**Obstacles on the Way**\n\nBut moving toward integration still had hurdles. One was the role of School Board member H.P. “Duke” Strople, who remained on the board as his term had yet to expire.\n\nStrople, a New Jersey native, had long been active in the City and its schools. Olom remembers him as a small man who delivered long orations to the City Council in his slow, drawn-out Jersey accent.\n\nIn 1951, Strople had been part of the Falls Church Emergency Schools Committee which brought the charges of maladministration against the School Board, compelling six members to resign. Strople later became a member of the School Board appointed by the conservative City Council.\n\nEven before being chosen for the School Board, however, Strople was a regular at City Council and School Board meetings, where he would regularly get up and complain about school funding, which he felt was too high.\n\nJessie Thackrey, a long-time resident who has been active in the City for five decades, and was a neighbor of Strople’s, said that he would speak so long that the City eventually created a maximum speaking time of just five minutes, a limit that survives to this day, now standing at three minutes.\n\nThackrey said that Strople was notorious in the community for his opposition to funding the schools. In February 1959, some students from George Mason High School staged a mock mourning in reaction to Strople’s recommendation to eliminate two nurse positions and the psychologist position at their school. As part of the prank they erected a tombstone in front of Strople’s house and burnt the letters “GM” into his yard.\n\nThackrey said that as adults and neighbors, she and her husband tried to take the issue seriously, especially when Strople wanted to make big deal out of the prank and punish the students. But so many people secretly thought it was funny, that it ended up with nothing more than an apology by the students.\n\nAfter the 1959 election, and with the new School Board soon in place, Strople became a minority voice on several issues, including a strident opposition to integration.\n\nIn February 1961, the new School Board began the process of recommending that the City take control over pupil placement from the state, the first step to integration.\n\nSix of the seven school board members were in support of the action but Strople stood hard against the idea. Though it was possible to still make the recommendation without Strople’s vote, the board wanted a unanimous decision.\n\nSchool Board member Roger Wollenberg made it a goal of his to get that unanimous vote, according to Wollenberg’s daughter, Meredith Morrison. The story goes, she said, that the night before the vote Wollenberg took Strople out for some drinks, then convinced him to support the School Board’s majority decision.\n\nA prominent First Amendment lawyer, Wollenberg was known for being extremely persuasive, and the next day, when Wollenberg proposed that Falls Church recommend control over its own pupil placement, it was Strople who stood up and seconded the move. The resolution passed unanimously.\n\nA month later the City Council unanimously approved local control over pupil assignment.\n\nBut the Council approval didn’t translate directly into integration. With the policy still being “freedom of choice,” it was up to each black student to apply and seek approval from the School Board to attend Falls Church schools. Facing the prospect of attending a school where the majority of the students might be opposed to integration, there was strong liklihood that black students would just continue to attend segregated schools.\n\nThough he consented on pupil placement, Strople continued to work to ensure that black students would remain in segregated schools. Following the Council’s unanimous acceptance of local placement, Strople attempted to make official the exchange policy that the Falls Church schools had been using for the past 12 years in regards to its black students. Strople opposed any move by the City to stop the payment of tuitions to Fairfax County for black students to attend non-integrated black schools there, thereby compelling full integration. But Strople’s backdoor attempt to perpetuate the process was voted down, 5-1 with one abstention.\n\nFinally, on April 4, 1961, the first-ever applications were filed on behalf of two black students to attend schools in the City. A third student filed a day later. The applications were approved by Superintendent Irvin Schmitt on April 13, 1961 . That fall, on September 6, 1961, three black students walked into their first classes in Falls Church, a thirteen year old girl and a fifteen year old girl at George Mason and a six year old boy at Madison Elementary. The single column headline in the _Northern Virginia Sun_ on that day stated simply, “All is Quiet.”\n\n**A Personal Account**\n\nDespite assurances by officials at George Mason High School and Madison Elementary that integration occurred “smoothly,” the experiences of those first students was anything but.\n\n“You didn’t have any riots, you didn’t have any signs, you didn’t have all the drama. So to them everything was OK,” said Marian Costner, one of those original three students, of the school officials.\n\nCostner, now married and living in Alexandria as Marian Selby, sat down for an extensive interview with the _News-Press_ about what it was like to be the first black student at George Mason High School , and how she weathered discrimination from fellow students and teachers in her three year journey to graduation.\n\nCostner is the daughter of Reverend Wallace E. Costner, former pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Falls Church, located off Annandale Road on Costner Drive, a road named after her father. A vital part of the community, Rev. Costner began preaching at Second Baptist in 1932 and remained at the church for nearly 40 years before his death.\n\nAmong those in Falls Church African American community, Rev. Costner was one of the most respected voices in town. Mary White, a lifetime member of Second Baptist, talked to the _News-Press_ about how Reverend Costner was like a father to all of them. She described how he would go out of his way to help any person in the community, no matter how well he knew them or how long they had lived here. He had taken White’s mother to the hospital when she had given birth to her, and he had brought Mary home from the hospital when she gave birth to her own first child.\n\nBut along with supporting his parishioners in their daily lives, Rev. Costner was also a civil rights preacher and a political leader. In the 1950s, as the fight for integration heated up, Rev. Costner was leading the charge from the pulpit. He would say how blacks were paying taxes in the City and should attend the schools they paid for.\n\nFor Rev. Costner’s daughter, who was reaching high school age just as the City began to implement integration, the role of racial pioneer seemed to be preordained. Marian Costner was the adopted daughter of the Reverend, but her biological lineage was just as prestigious in terms of activism. Her great-grandfather was Joseph Tinner, a founder of the Fairfax County NAACP, the first ever rural branch in the organization’s history.\n\nStill, even with this history, it was no small task for a teenager walking into a new school as the only African American, facing down centuries of bigotry, along with a chaotic present, in a time when violence over the issue was breaking out across the country.\n\nBut school integration was something that had to be fought by the resolve of children and teenagers, and without their courageous efforts, could not happen. While the fight to integrate buses and lunch counters could be waged by people of all ages, schools by their very definition required heroics from students who, in normal circumstances should just have to worry about homework, after school activities and friendships.\n\nCostner said that she remembers her parents talking with her about the choice. They asked her whether she would be willing to go, but to her, she said, the choice was already made. It was what she was supposed to do.\n\nNow, looking back on that time decades after she completed high school and knowing what she does now, Costner said she’s not sure whether she would have made the same decision.\n\n“They were right decisions. I needed to go. But whether it was right for me…I still think about it. I think I missed an awful lot by attending George Mason,” she said.\n\nCostner said that going from the all-black Luther Jackson, the school she attended as a ninth-grader, to George Mason High School for her sophomore year was quite a shock. At Luther Jackson, she had been very popular.\n\nIn just her freshman year she was a member of the basketball team, the choir, Spanish club, Pep Squad, drama club and the math and science club.\n\nHer first year at Mason, though, would prove to be far different.\n\nFrom the start, she said, she could tell she was going to face resistance in a number of ways. The first time she got on the school bus, Costner remembers the bus-driver turning to her and asking her how she liked going to school in America, assuming she was a foreign exchange student.\n\n“I looked at him and I said ‘compared to what?'” Costner laughed. “He did a double take, like ‘Oh no, she’s really black.’ He was blown away”\n\nCostner talked about walking through the halls and classmates yelling racial epithets at her, telling her to go back where she belonged. Even among the teachers, Costner can remember several of the staff who treated her differently from the rest of the students, though they were less obvious in their behavior.\n\nGoing home at the end of the day didn’t necessarily mean an escape from persecution, though Costner said that her parents did their best to shield her from the worst.\n\nShe remembers waking up one morning to find her father cleaning up burn spots on their front lawn. Though he never told her exactly what it was, White confirmed that on at least one occasion, a cross was burned at the Costner household in response to her attending George Mason.\n\nOn another occasion Costner came home to find a voodoo doll stuck in her door. She said she was so naïve at the time that she actually believed someone had given her a gift. Her father had taken away the doll, telling her it wasn’t something for her to play with, but it wasn’t until years later, looking back, that she realized what it really meant.\n\nEven more painful than those slights from individual classmates was the general animosity Costner said she felt in her junior year during the Junior-Senior Prom. Scheduled to be held at the Army/Navy Country Club, the prom was the bright spot of the spring semester for the students. As they always do, it involved lavish dining and decorations, and was the highlight for students who spent days picking out dressed and prom dates.\n\nA day before the prom was to be held, however, someone at the club found out that a black student would be among the attendees and contacted the school to tell them that if Costner showed up, she wouldn’t be allowed in.\n\nFearing legal action from Rev. Costner, George Mason administrators moved the prom at the last minute. Instead of lavish dining, George Mason juniors and seniors snacked on peanuts and popcorn. Costner said that she stood in the corner of the room, practically able to feel the anger directed at her, it was so intense.\n\nShe was so uncomfortable she left after just half an hour, knowing that that probably made her classmates even more upset.\n\nBut Costner retained a brave, pro-active posture. In 1963, while in her junior year of high school, she got involved in integrating the State Theatre. Before that time, blacks had to go all the way to Washington, D.C. to watch movies. After complaints from Falls Church residents, the State Theatre eventually agreed to allow blacks to sit in the balcony, but Costner and several other black students refused to be satisfied.\n\nWith the urging of her father, Costner and her fellow black students walked in picket lines in front of the theatre, refusing to move until ownership capitulated and allowed them to sit in the regular seats. She said that on the picket line there were those who accosted them and threw food at them. There was even a group of white supremacists who showed up to intimidate them. But they kept demonstrating until the State Theatre agreed to allow them in.\n\nBy the end of her senior year, Costner said that she had gotten stronger, the past three years building in her the energy to go further than before, something which would ultimately lead to more controversy.\n\nWhile she had previously just been happy to get through the school day without being intimidated, at her senior prom she decided to take the “bull by the horns” and go with a white student as her date, the son of California Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin.\n\nTo make things even more scandalous, Sharon Schmutzler, a white student from George Mason, went to the prom with Costner’s cousin. The two couples wore black and white to draw even more attention to their statement. “The School Board didn’t like it at all,” Costner said. “But to us, it was just my way of venting.”\n\nOver her three years at George Mason, Costner did make friends, among them, many who were considered to be the most popular at the school. They included Linda and Joanne Silverstein, daughters of Harold Silverstein, who was elected to the Falls Church City Council in 1961.\n\nStill, Costner said that when she finally graduated in 1964, she left high school and didn’t look back. “I have very few good memories of Mason. That’s why I never go back to reunions,” she said. “Unless someone in my class married inter-racially, it would still be only me.”\n\nFor the past 28 years she has raised her three sons in Alexandria with her husband, a deputy sheriff with the Alexandria Police Department. She owns and runs a public relations business.\n\nAs for her feelings on race, Costner said that her experience at Mason taught her to separate race from her feelings about individual people. “No matter how bad people treated me, I didn’t condemn the whole race for that,” she said. “That was an important thing that my parents taught me.”\n\nWhen Marian Costner graduated from George Mason High School in 1964 there were less than half a dozen black students at the school. By 1965, Falls Church was one of the few school districts in the entire greater Washington, D.C. area that had fully integrated.\n\n## Recent News\n\n[![Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\n#### [Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-25](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/#respond)\n\nMarch 25, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), who represents a Northern Virginia district in the U.S. House…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/)\n\n[![City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162633/City.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\n#### [City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-24](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/#respond)\n\nMonday, March 24, 2025 — During tonight’s City Council meeting, Falls Church City Manager Wyatt Shields proposed a Fiscal Year 2026 (FY2026)…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/)\n\n[![Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\n#### [Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-22](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/#respond)\n\nMarch 21, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Representative Don Beyer (D-VA), joined by Representatives André Carson (D-IN), Gerry Connolly (D-VA),…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/)\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n[PrevPreviousMeeting John A.

(Photo: FCCPS)\n\nAn original copy of the 12-page program provided to all who participated in an October 1952 three-day dedication of the next George Mason High School campus in Falls Church was stumbled upon late last week and was shared via the school’s website.\n\nAs citizens of Falls Church today are faced with the responsibility of voting on a $120 million school bond referendum next month for a new George Mason High, the vivid reminder of the 65-year-old dedication of the original school footprint has underscored the importance of the upcoming vote. Vice Mayor Marybeth Connelly, who came across the original program, posted it on the daily morning briefing site for the schools this week.\n\n[\\[View the full 1952 Program of Dedication for George Mason Junior-Senior High School here\\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_d3BAquUl6qTVlxRWdINXRWVE0/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFalls Church citizens of that era were clearly very proud of their new school, as a perusal of the the Dedication Ceremony program makes clear. The dedication was billed as “A Festival of Progress,” and celebratory events ran from Friday night through midday Sunday.\n\nAfter the City of Falls Church was incorporated as an independent city in August 1948, and therefore totally responsible for its own school system, one of the first moves was a voter approval of a $700,000 bond referendum in 1949 authorizing the purchase of 25 acres at the corner of Leesburg Pike and Haycock Road and more acreage at what became the Mt. Daniel Elementary.\n\nThe cost of the land purchase by the City was $40,000 and the high school was designed to accommodate 325 students, including 22 full-time and five part-time teachers. (Today, the bond referendum on the ballot next month is for $120 million and 10 acres of the school land is valued at $40-45 million. The new high school would accommodate 1,650 students).\n\nConstruction of the new school was delayed when a major backlash erupted in the City leading in 1951 to overturning of the City Council and to the resignation of six of the seven members of the then-appointed School Board. in 1951.\n\nBut the new George Mason Junior/Senior High School was eventually completed and opened for grades 6 to 12 in 1952. Its design plans had been acclaimed as among the top 14 of over 200 entries from school systems across the U.S. but a shortage of funds offered by the new City Council delayed the completion of a larger footprint, and from its opening classes had to be held in the gym, for example.\n\nA lot of what needs fixing at the high school now are materials and components that were part of the original 1952 construction.\n\nThe October 10-12 dedication as a “Festival of Progress” was proclaimed in the program by Falls Church Mayor Charles E. Kellogg, who invited all citizens of the community to “participate in this festival as good neighbors and friends, remembering with humility our debt to the past, cherishing with pride our present achievements, and facing the future of our city, state and nation with confidence and unity.”\n\nFifty-six original patrons of the festival included such groups as the Greater Falls Church Citizens Association, Page Hughes Buick, the Lions Club and Kiwanis, Robertson’s 5 and 10 Cent store, Goot’s Linoleum, Bunny Gibson’s Seafood Market, Horace E. Brown, the Chamber of Commerce, Falls Church Community Theater, the Cherrydale Cement Block Company, the Falls Church Womens Club and City founding father Claude Wells, after whom the City Hall was later named. The program’s illustrations were the work of students Kasha LaRew, Marylou Taylor and Roberta Rucker.\n\nThe events began with a citywide dance in the school gym (still there, now known as ‘The Pit’) and on Saturday they commenced with a parade from Cherry and Broad west on Broad to the school site.\n\nOutdoor ceremonies began at 2 p.m., with the groundbreaking for the new addition by School Superintendent Irvin H. Schmitt and School Board chair John A. Johnson.\n\nFuture F.C. Mayor Herman L. Fink was among the keynote speakers along with Virginia State Sen. John A. K. Donovan.\n\nOn Sunday, the events continued with “a pilgrimage of historical places in the City of Falls Church” sponsored by the Falls Church chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nMembers of the Falls Church School Board then were Johnson, Oliver Caldwell, Richard Saintsing, Daniel Stapleton, H. P. Strope, Francis W. Trapp and John W. Wells.\n\nIn addition to Fink, another future mayor, Charles Hedetniemi, was an officer of the high school PTA and future mayor Lee Rhoads was on the dedication committee.\n\nThe program included a statement congratulating the clergy and congregation of the St. James parish on the completion of its new parish, and suggested that “everyone go to the church of his choice on Sunday, Oct. 12, to thank almighty God for his blessings which have inspired our Festival of Progress.”\n\nA robust drawing of the school mascot, the Mustang, up on its hind legs, filled out the program for the event.\n\nBut the most momentous individual listed in the program was Johnson, chair of the School Board. The general counsel to the Air Force, he was the only member of the School Board who did not resign in 1951, and went on to spearhead the City schools’ integration efforts following the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Brown Vs. Board of Education in 1954.\n\nLeading the effort over the reluctance of other members of the School Board, he championed the effort in the 1950s such that the Falls Church schools eventually became only the second district in Virginia to integrate, though not until the early 1960s.\n\nIn 2005, on the occasion of the dedication of the new Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School, the News-Press tasked reporter Darien Bates with an extensive research project that led to a two-part series in September 2005 spelling out a detailed history of how the Falls Church City schools were integrated. It included interviews with Lou Olom and the late Jessie Thackrey.\n\nIt was then that Johnson’s seminal role was first and decisively documented.\n\n## Recent News\n\n[![Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\n#### [Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-25](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/#respond)\n\nMarch 25, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), who represents a Northern Virginia district in the U.S. House…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/10/11/program-dedication-found-new-gm-high-school-65-years-ago/)\n\n[![City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162633/City.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\n#### [City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-24](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/#respond)\n\nMonday, March 24, 2025 — During tonight’s City Council meeting, Falls Church City Manager Wyatt Shields proposed a Fiscal Year 2026 (FY2026)…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/10/11/program-dedication-found-new-gm-high-school-65-years-ago/)\n\n[![Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\n#### [Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-22](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/#respond)\n\nMarch 21, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Representative Don Beyer (D-VA), joined by Representatives André Carson (D-IN), Gerry Connolly (D-VA),…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/10/11/program-dedication-found-new-gm-high-school-65-years-ago/)\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n[PrevPreviousF.C.

## M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board

[2005-10-06](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/)in[News](https://www.fcnp.com/category/c20-news/)

Right in the City of Falls Church, imagine cross burnings in your front yard, or having rotten fruit thrown at you as you picket in front of the State Theatre. And imagine being the one black student at George Mason High School with classmates who hate you just for the color of your skin, who want you to go back to your school and forget about equal rights.

Marian Costner experienced this 41 years ago as she became the first black student to graduate from George Mason, following its landmark integration in 1961, the opening stages of the struggle for which was documented in the first part of this series last week.

To get to a place where she could stand as a George Mason graduate, Falls Church had to go through a series of changes, shedding a mottled Virginia history of segregation, and slavery over a period of 10 years to take on the mantle of equal rights.

Last week, Part One of this exclusive _Falls Church News-Press_ series described the events in Falls Church in the first years following the Brown Vs. the Board of Education decisions, including the efforts of F.C. School Board chair John A. Johnson. But though Johnson worked arduously starting in 1955 to integrate the schools, that champion ended up leaving the City before seeing the change he had hoped and worked for.

This second article recounts how the schools finally desegregated in 1961, and the travails of Costner and what she faced as the first African American student to attend the City’s George Mason High School.

**A Changing Tide**

In the years of Virginia’s “massive resistance” to the Supreme Court’s decision on Brown Vs. Board II, beginning in 1956, there was little local jurisdictions in the commonwealth could do on their own to end segregation. A “Dillon Rule” state, Virginia’s constitution prohibited local jurisdictions from doing anything not specifically permitted by the state, an anomaly that exists to this day. In 1956, the state established a “pupil placement board” to ensure that state control to maintain segregation. It held sway over all decisions about where students could attend school. Any locality that attempted to go against its decisions was threatened with the loss of state funding and more.

While integration had been stalled by the state, however, those efforts could only delay integration, not prevent it. As the commonwealth plumbed the legal depths to find a way to stop the rising tide, little by little, moves toward integration were happening around the state.

Even though the City of Falls Church was prohibited from making any direct headway to desegregate, there was an evolution happening in the City that would ultimately prove important when the opportunity to integrate finally arose again.

As stated in Part One of this series, during the majority of the 1950s, the government of the City of Falls Church was led by a group of conservative councilmen who had come to power in the election of 1951 and subsequently kept the reins on the City for nine years. Without a concerted effort from more progressive citizens, who had originally helped establish the independent city, conservatives managed to win election after election to the Council.

But in 1959, a decade after Falls Church had first seceded from Fairfax County to become an independent city under Virginia law, a group of residents formed a civic organization called the Citizens for a Better Council, later known as the Citizens for a Better City, or the CBC. It was modeled on the “Arlingtonians for a Better County” in adjacent Arlington County, maintained as a non-partisan civic association in order not to violate federal law prohibiting federal employees from being involved in partisan politics. The first president of CBC was Lou Olom, whose own children attended the Falls Church schools and whose primary focus was on the quality of those schools.

Established in early 1959 and learning as it went, the CBC set its sights on the June elections of that year, backing candidates Charles J. Hedetniemi, Everett D. Johnston and Lee M. Rhoads to contest for the three seats up for election. Composed of both Democrats and Republicans, the group championed the cause of the schools, which it felt was being under funded by the presiding administration.

Over the previous two years, the City Council had taken several actions to cut money to the schools. In 1957 it prevented a referendum on a bond for high school expansion, despite 1,200 of the City’s 10,000 residents signing a petition. The Council subsequently replaced all the School Board members who had recommended passage the referendum (School Board members were appointed by the Council back then).

The next year, the Council and the School Board voted together to take the seventh grade out of George Mason and place it in the elementary school in an effort to try to get around the need for a larger high school, over the protests of many.

In an editorial in the June 8, 1959 edition of the _Washington Post_, on the eve of the Falls Church City Council election, the paper laid out the two sides, one representing, as it described, “the needs of a modern community,” and comparing the other to a kind of “medieval government.” The editorial said that the schools and the City’s reputation were at stake in the 1959 election.

Even though the issue of integration remained largely out of the public discussion, it was lurking in the background. As schools all over the South fought, and increasingly lost, the fight against integration, it was clear to those defending the conservative platform in Falls Church that a change in the City Council could mean a change in integration policy, as well.

“It was never stated publicly, but it was all over the place,” Olom said. He added that there were many who weren’t too worried about integration, but those that “did give a hoot knew, and they spread the word.”

One member of the Falls Church School Board in 1959, in particular, was a supporter of the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties, a group formed in the wake of the Brown Vs. Board decision dedicated to maintaining segregation, even to the point of closing schools, as had happened in Virginia ‘s Prince Edward County .

In the election of June 9, 1959, with a solid show of support from the citizens of Falls Church, all three CBC candidates won seats on the City Council. But with the three victories, the CBC was still a vote shy of having control over the seven-member Council. However, prior to the election, a member of the existing council, Charlie Hailey met with the CBC and came to an agreement with the CBC leadership that if it won, he would be willing to take their side as long as they voted for him as mayor.

The CBC agreed and when the Council took office after the election, it ended up in control of the Council by a four-to-three margin, with the assistance of Hailey as mayor.

“He sensed that the atmosphere was changing,” Olom said.

**Another Chance**

Hailey’s decision meant that the City, which for nine years had been heading in one direction, suddenly performed an about-face just as integration was once again becoming a front-burner issue.

In 1961, in its continued effort to resist federal pressure to integrate schools statewide, Virginia adopted a fall-back “local option” policy. The policy allowed localities to petition for the right to decide student placement.

In order to take advantage of the change, each individual school board had to vote to recommend to their City Council that it apply for exemption from the State Pupil Placement policy. The Council then had to vote to approve that recommendation before the state would cede power to the locality.

The procedure was meant to create prohibitive complications for local governments and give individuals at the local level the power to stem integration. But though intended to delay desegregation, in Falls Church the change meant that the newly elected Council members could take the first steps towards integrated schools.

Following the example of Arlington County, which integrated almost immediately after the passage of the new policy, Falls Church began the process to regain local control over pupil placements.

Having failed twice before to integrate when this new opportunity first arose, it was unlikely that the CBC-controlled City Council would miss this chance, especially when its Arlington neighbors already succeeded.

In the year following the Council election, the School Board underwent an overhaul as the new Council replaced conservative School Board members when their terms expired with others eager to develop new educational ideas in Falls Church and also looking to finally integrate the schools.

**Obstacles on the Way**

But moving toward integration still had hurdles. One was the role of School Board member H.P. “Duke” Strople, who remained on the board as his term had yet to expire.

Strople, a New Jersey native, had long been active in the City and its schools. Olom remembers him as a small man who delivered long orations to the City Council in his slow, drawn-out Jersey accent.

In 1951, Strople had been part of the Falls Church Emergency Schools Committee which brought the charges of maladministration against the School Board, compelling six members to resign. Strople later became a member of the School Board appointed by the conservative City Council.

Even before being chosen for the School Board, however, Strople was a regular at City Council and School Board meetings, where he would regularly get up and complain about school funding, which he felt was too high.

Jessie Thackrey, a long-time resident who has been active in the City for five decades, and was a neighbor of Strople’s, said that he would speak so long that the City eventually created a maximum speaking time of just five minutes, a limit that survives to this day, now standing at three minutes.

Thackrey said that Strople was notorious in the community for his opposition to funding the schools. In February 1959, some students from George Mason High School staged a mock mourning in reaction to Strople’s recommendation to eliminate two nurse positions and the psychologist position at their school. As part of the prank they erected a tombstone in front of Strople’s house and burnt the letters “GM” into his yard.

Thackrey said that as adults and neighbors, she and her husband tried to take the issue seriously, especially when Strople wanted to make big deal out of the prank and punish the students. But so many people secretly thought it was funny, that it ended up with nothing more than an apology by the students.

After the 1959 election, and with the new School Board soon in place, Strople became a minority voice on several issues, including a strident opposition to integration.

In February 1961, the new School Board began the process of recommending that the City take control over pupil placement from the state, the first step to integration.

Six of the seven school board members were in support of the action but Strople stood hard against the idea. Though it was possible to still make the recommendation without Strople’s vote, the board wanted a unanimous decision.

School Board member Roger Wollenberg made it a goal of his to get that unanimous vote, according to Wollenberg’s daughter, Meredith Morrison. The story goes, she said, that the night before the vote Wollenberg took Strople out for some drinks, then convinced him to support the School Board’s majority decision.

A prominent First Amendment lawyer, Wollenberg was known for being extremely persuasive, and the next day, when Wollenberg proposed that Falls Church recommend control over its own pupil placement, it was Strople who stood up and seconded the move. The resolution passed unanimously.

A month later the City Council unanimously approved local control over pupil assignment.

But the Council approval didn’t translate directly into integration. With the policy still being “freedom of choice,” it was up to each black student to apply and seek approval from the School Board to attend Falls Church schools. Facing the prospect of attending a school where the majority of the students might be opposed to integration, there was strong liklihood that black students would just continue to attend segregated schools.

Though he consented on pupil placement, Strople continued to work to ensure that black students would remain in segregated schools. Following the Council’s unanimous acceptance of local placement, Strople attempted to make official the exchange policy that the Falls Church schools had been using for the past 12 years in regards to its black students. Strople opposed any move by the City to stop the payment of tuitions to Fairfax County for black students to attend non-integrated black schools there, thereby compelling full integration. But Strople’s backdoor attempt to perpetuate the process was voted down, 5-1 with one abstention.

Finally, on April 4, 1961, the first-ever applications were filed on behalf of two black students to attend schools in the City. A third student filed a day later. The applications were approved by Superintendent Irvin Schmitt on April 13, 1961 . That fall, on September 6, 1961, three black students walked into their first classes in Falls Church, a thirteen year old girl and a fifteen year old girl at George Mason and a six year old boy at Madison Elementary. The single column headline in the _Northern Virginia Sun_ on that day stated simply, “All is Quiet.”

**A Personal Account**

Despite assurances by officials at George Mason High School and Madison Elementary that integration occurred “smoothly,” the experiences of those first students was anything but.

“You didn’t have any riots, you didn’t have any signs, you didn’t have all the drama. So to them everything was OK,” said Marian Costner, one of those original three students, of the school officials.

Costner, now married and living in Alexandria as Marian Selby, sat down for an extensive interview with the _News-Press_ about what it was like to be the first black student at George Mason High School , and how she weathered discrimination from fellow students and teachers in her three year journey to graduation.

Costner is the daughter of Reverend Wallace E. Costner, former pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Falls Church, located off Annandale Road on Costner Drive, a road named after her father. A vital part of the community, Rev. Costner began preaching at Second Baptist in 1932 and remained at the church for nearly 40 years before his death.

Among those in Falls Church African American community, Rev. Costner was one of the most respected voices in town. Mary White, a lifetime member of Second Baptist, talked to the _News-Press_ about how Reverend Costner was like a father to all of them. She described how he would go out of his way to help any person in the community, no matter how well he knew them or how long they had lived here. He had taken White’s mother to the hospital when she had given birth to her, and he had brought Mary home from the hospital when she gave birth to her own first child.

But along with supporting his parishioners in their daily lives, Rev. Costner was also a civil rights preacher and a political leader. In the 1950s, as the fight for integration heated up, Rev. Costner was leading the charge from the pulpit. He would say how blacks were paying taxes in the City and should attend the schools they paid for.

For Rev. Costner’s daughter, who was reaching high school age just as the City began to implement integration, the role of racial pioneer seemed to be preordained. Marian Costner was the adopted daughter of the Reverend, but her biological lineage was just as prestigious in terms of activism. Her great-grandfather was Joseph Tinner, a founder of the Fairfax County NAACP, the first ever rural branch in the organization’s history.

Still, even with this history, it was no small task for a teenager walking into a new school as the only African American, facing down centuries of bigotry, along with a chaotic present, in a time when violence over the issue was breaking out across the country.

But school integration was something that had to be fought by the resolve of children and teenagers, and without their courageous efforts, could not happen. While the fight to integrate buses and lunch counters could be waged by people of all ages, schools by their very definition required heroics from students who, in normal circumstances should just have to worry about homework, after school activities and friendships.

Costner said that she remembers her parents talking with her about the choice. They asked her whether she would be willing to go, but to her, she said, the choice was already made. It was what she was supposed to do.

Now, looking back on that time decades after she completed high school and knowing what she does now, Costner said she’s not sure whether she would have made the same decision.

“They were right decisions. I needed to go. But whether it was right for me…I still think about it. I think I missed an awful lot by attending George Mason,” she said.

Costner said that going from the all-black Luther Jackson, the school she attended as a ninth-grader, to George Mason High School for her sophomore year was quite a shock. At Luther Jackson, she had been very popular.

In just her freshman year she was a member of the basketball team, the choir, Spanish club, Pep Squad, drama club and the math and science club.

Her first year at Mason, though, would prove to be far different.

From the start, she said, she could tell she was going to face resistance in a number of ways. The first time she got on the school bus, Costner remembers the bus-driver turning to her and asking her how she liked going to school in America, assuming she was a foreign exchange student.

“I looked at him and I said ‘compared to what?'” Costner laughed. “He did a double take, like ‘Oh no, she’s really black.’ He was blown away”

Costner talked about walking through the halls and classmates yelling racial epithets at her, telling her to go back where she belonged. Even among the teachers, Costner can remember several of the staff who treated her differently from the rest of the students, though they were less obvious in their behavior.

Going home at the end of the day didn’t necessarily mean an escape from persecution, though Costner said that her parents did their best to shield her from the worst.

She remembers waking up one morning to find her father cleaning up burn spots on their front lawn. Though he never told her exactly what it was, White confirmed that on at least one occasion, a cross was burned at the Costner household in response to her attending George Mason.

On another occasion Costner came home to find a voodoo doll stuck in her door. She said she was so naïve at the time that she actually believed someone had given her a gift. Her father had taken away the doll, telling her it wasn’t something for her to play with, but it wasn’t until years later, looking back, that she realized what it really meant.

Even more painful than those slights from individual classmates was the general animosity Costner said she felt in her junior year during the Junior-Senior Prom. Scheduled to be held at the Army/Navy Country Club, the prom was the bright spot of the spring semester for the students. As they always do, it involved lavish dining and decorations, and was the highlight for students who spent days picking out dressed and prom dates.

A day before the prom was to be held, however, someone at the club found out that a black student would be among the attendees and contacted the school to tell them that if Costner showed up, she wouldn’t be allowed in.

Fearing legal action from Rev. Costner, George Mason administrators moved the prom at the last minute. Instead of lavish dining, George Mason juniors and seniors snacked on peanuts and popcorn. Costner said that she stood in the corner of the room, practically able to feel the anger directed at her, it was so intense.

She was so uncomfortable she left after just half an hour, knowing that that probably made her classmates even more upset.

But Costner retained a brave, pro-active posture. In 1963, while in her junior year of high school, she got involved in integrating the State Theatre. Before that time, blacks had to go all the way to Washington, D.C. to watch movies. After complaints from Falls Church residents, the State Theatre eventually agreed to allow blacks to sit in the balcony, but Costner and several other black students refused to be satisfied.

With the urging of her father, Costner and her fellow black students walked in picket lines in front of the theatre, refusing to move until ownership capitulated and allowed them to sit in the regular seats. She said that on the picket line there were those who accosted them and threw food at them. There was even a group of white supremacists who showed up to intimidate them. But they kept demonstrating until the State Theatre agreed to allow them in.

By the end of her senior year, Costner said that she had gotten stronger, the past three years building in her the energy to go further than before, something which would ultimately lead to more controversy.

While she had previously just been happy to get through the school day without being intimidated, at her senior prom she decided to take the “bull by the horns” and go with a white student as her date, the son of California Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin.

To make things even more scandalous, Sharon Schmutzler, a white student from George Mason, went to the prom with Costner’s cousin. The two couples wore black and white to draw even more attention to their statement. “The School Board didn’t like it at all,” Costner said. “But to us, it was just my way of venting.”

Over her three years at George Mason, Costner did make friends, among them, many who were considered to be the most popular at the school. They included Linda and Joanne Silverstein, daughters of Harold Silverstein, who was elected to the Falls Church City Council in 1961.

Still, Costner said that when she finally graduated in 1964, she left high school and didn’t look back. “I have very few good memories of Mason. That’s why I never go back to reunions,” she said. “Unless someone in my class married inter-racially, it would still be only me.”

For the past 28 years she has raised her three sons in Alexandria with her husband, a deputy sheriff with the Alexandria Police Department. She owns and runs a public relations business.

As for her feelings on race, Costner said that her experience at Mason taught her to separate race from her feelings about individual people. “No matter how bad people treated me, I didn’t condemn the whole race for that,” she said. “That was an important thing that my parents taught me.”

When Marian Costner graduated from George Mason High School in 1964 there were less than half a dozen black students at the school. By 1965, Falls Church was one of the few school districts in the entire greater Washington, D.C. area that had fully integrated.

Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools\n\n![Picture of FCNP.com](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/07232714/FCNPLogo.svg)\n\n#### FCNP.com\n\n[2005-09-25](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/)in[News](https://www.fcnp.com/category/c20-news/)\n\nTwo Sundays ago, the City of Falls Church honored teacher, principal and community activist Mary Ellen Henderson with the dedication of a new middle school named for her. In speeches by local, state and federal officials, Henderson was celebrated for her work bringing awareness to the condition of segregated black schools in Falls Church and Fairfax County.\n\nBut though she taught for decades and managed to instigate the building of a new school for black students in Falls Church, by the time she retired, the greatest inequality still existed. Segregation still reigned in Virginia , and blacks were still forced to attend different schools from white students. It wasn’t until the Supreme Court in the mid-1950s stepped in that localities were forced to take action to integrate, and in Virginia in some cases, that took over a decade.\n\nThe 1950s struggle to develop and integrate a new school system in the newly-independent City of Falls Church was an heroic and monumental undertaking in its own right, a struggle from which emerged yet another unsung champion, school board chairman John Alvin Johnson.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnson’s seminal role will be detailed below, we begin this story with an overview of how the newly-established jurisdiction with its own, brand new school system and tasked with winning public support for building its schools and hiring a quality staff while working out its own identity apart from Fairfax County, dealt with segregation in its classrooms. It’s a story about striving to develop a City atmosphere that included a changing paradigm of the traditional educational system in the context of a Southern culture, centuries old.\n\nThis article tracks from the moment the Supreme Court made “Brown Vs. Board of Education” ruling on segregation in 1954, the tense discussion going on in the City of Falls Church about whether to integrate. And explains why it wasn’t until six years after the Supreme Court’s second Brown Vs. Board of Education ruling in 1955 that Falls Church became only the second school district in Virginia to admit black students into its classroom.\n\nMost people think the integration of Southern schools began on May 17, 1954 , the day that the Supreme Court decided in the case of Brown vs. Board of Education that the “separate but equal” clause long applied to segregated schools was unconstitutional.\n\nBut, actually, it wasn’t until May 31, 1955 that, in a second ruling, the Supreme Court made the decision on the pace at which school systems had to desegregate. In three famous words, “all deliberate speed,” the Supreme Court set in motion a process that would take years, as school systems throughout the South wrestled with and resisted the integration of black students into previously all-white schools.\n\nIn some school districts like Prince Edward County in central Virginia, the resistance was so great that the school system ultimately closed the doors of the public schools for five years rather than allow black students to share a classroom with white students. In other localities the resistance wasn’t so great. But as the responsibility of integration shifted back and forth between state and local governments, each jurisdiction was forced to deal with the issue of ending a system of racial separation as old as the colonization of the New World .\n\n**A City Divided**\n\nIn discussing the path towards desegregation, it is first necessary to understand the overall political climate of a City that was just starting out.\n\nIt was only six years before the Supreme Court decision on segregation that Falls Church became an independent city, separating itself from Fairfax County on August 15, 1948. Though several reasons were cited at the time including taxes and roads, still active City resident Jessie Thackrey, whose husband Franklin Thackrey helped compose the new city charter, explained in an interview with the News-Press recently that the primary reason for the separation was the desire to have control over an independent school system. It was the feeling of many in Falls Church at the time that under Fairfax County governance, Falls Church schools were under-funded.\n\nBut the central role the schools played in the creation of the new jurisdiction also put them at the heart of the debate about the direction of the City. On one side was a new wave of young parents, the “young Turks,” as one of their still thriving number, Lou Olom described them in his recent News-Press interview. Many of these “young Turks” had recently moved to the area, bringing with them advanced degrees, government jobs and quite often, liberal politics.\n\nOn the other side were the long-time residents of the small Virginia village, many of whom had family that lived in the area for generations and whose cultural views were much more in tune with the traditional Southern lifestyles that included an ingrained belief in segregation.\n\nSo, like the other school systems in Virginia and throughout the rest of the South, the new Falls Church school system began segregated. White students attended schools in the City but since there weren’t any black schools in the small City, all the black students in Falls Church had to attend schools in Fairfax County. Falls Church paid tuition to the county for these students, who totaled only 30 in 1955.\n\nThe reason for the small number of African American students in Falls Church was largely due to a decision made in 1887 when Falls Church was just a town. The town leadership voted to cut their town’s size in half, annexing to Fairfax County the area south of Lee Highway known as the “colored settlement.” The decision meant that the City of Falls Church would remain mostly Caucasian, even to this day.\n\nBut in the early 1950’s the focus of the community was much more about the overall philosophy of education and the amount of funding going to the schools, than about the status of its black students. While the City had been founded as an independent jurisdiction in 1948 by those who seeking more school funding, by the beginning of the 1950’s there was already a reaction from residents who thought that too many of the City’s resources were going to the schools.\n\nOne year after becoming an independent city, in 1949 the City Council passed a $700,000 school bond issue for the building of two new schools. Then, as the 1951 election rolled around, the Council placed a referendum on the ballot requesting another $500,000 bond, half of which would go towards the schools.\n\nDespite the need for new facilities and salaries, there were those in the City who were nervous about that amount of money going to the schools. The request for more money accompanied by attacks from the opposition, galvanized the conservative members of the City, made up largely of small business owners and long term residents. So, in the June 1951 election, the Council that had led the establishment of the independent City just three years prior was voted out of office.\n\nFour months later, six of the seven members of the School Board, which had been appointed by the council, resigned _en masse_ after suffering accusations of mismanagement by a community group calling itself the Falls Church Emergency Schools Committee. The accusations had been made prior to the election, but with the new Council in place the charges were now backed up at City Hall. The board was then replaced with six new members hand-picked by the new Council.\n\nOnly one member remained from that original board, our aforementioned Mr. John Alvin Johnson. Mr. Johnson had been overseas during the controversy, doing work for the Air Force. Following the mass resignation of the six School Board members, he was asked whether he would resign as well. He refused, choosing instead to remain on the board, a decision that would prove to be important in the tumultuous years ahead.\n\n“We were lucky to have him there,” Mrs. Thackrey said in her interview with the News-Press. She told of how over the next six years as chairman for the School Board, Johnson fought tooth and nail for continued funding of the schools, despite resistance from a school board largely in favor of cutting the school budget.\n\nBut Johnson’s fight on the school board went beyond budgets and school funding when, in 1955, the Supreme Court decision brought desegregation to the forefront. From the time of the Supreme Court decision, he stood alone as the only board member to stand openly for the immediate integration of the Falls Church schools.\n\n**A Man and His Cause**\n\nBy 1951, in the brief time since he came to Falls Church, Johnson had gained a reputation as a brilliant mind and skilled leader. Though he would end up living in Falls Church only eight years, those he worked with remember him to this day with great respect and admiration.\n\nOf Norwegian descent, John Johnson was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and spent most of his youth in Hammond, Indiana, a suburb of Chicago. In 1937 he received his bachelor’s degree from DePauw University and a year later, while earning his law degree from the University of Chicago, met Harriet, the woman he would be married to for 67 years until his death just this summer.\n\nDuring World War II, Johnson served as a naval officer on the destroyer USS Robert H. Smith, which took part in the invasion of Iwo Jima in the Pacific campaign.\n\nAfter returning from the war, Johnson went back to school to get his master’s degree in law from Harvard University.\n\nIn 1949, while working for the State Department, Johnson and his wife moved to Falls Church, just as it was becoming an independent jurisdiction. Immediately Johnson became a charter member of the newly forming city.\n\nIn 1952, as he was working on the Falls Church School Board, Johnson was general counsel for the Air Force, a job he held until 1958, when he moved to Arlington and became general counsel for NASA.\n\nHe would later go on to an impressive career in the field of satellite communications, serving as international vice president for the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat) then as president of Comsat General Corporation.\n\nDescribed as a deeply religious man, Johnson was a member of the Church of Christ , located in the Culmore area in Falls Church , for over 50 years, serving as a deacon and elder, and helping promote mission work throughout South and Central America , often spending a significant amount of time traveling to those countries bringing aid.\n\nWith a history of working towards human rights it is no surprise that during the 1950’s he would champion the issue of integration.\n\nFrom the time he and his wife moved into Falls Church, Johnson was intent on doing something about segregation. His daughter Barbara Groff, who now lives in Reedville , Virginia with her husband, said that at a very early age she was aware of her father’s concern. She remembers vividly her father’s insistence on fair treatment regardless of race or nationality, and also how disturbed he was by living in an area where bigotry was so accepted.\n\n“He was quite discouraged about it,” Groff said.\n\n**The Beginning of a Fight**\n\nWith the second Supreme Court Brown Vs. Board of Education ruling in 1955, Johnson, who had been meeting regularly with leaders of the African American community (including E.B. Henderson, husband of Mary Ellen Henderson), thought he saw an opening, since the ruling called for integration with “all deliberate speed.” On June 2, just three days after the Supreme Court’s decision, Johnson, as chairman of the School Board, submitted to the board a letter that he’d written and wanted to send to the state Board of Education concerning the integration of the Falls Church schools.\n\nIn the letter, Johnson noted the small number of African American students in the Falls Church school district and that there would be little burden placed on the school system from integrating those students into the Falls Church schools.\n\nHe wrote: “The Falls Church School Board sees no administrative obstacles to the admission of Negro pupils to the Falls Church public schools. Their number is so small that no increase in either physical facilities or teaching staff would be required for the coming school year if all of them were to be admitted to the Falls Church schools at the opening of school in September 1955.”\n\nBut despite his arguments for immediate desegregation, the letter was never sent to the state board. The Falls Church School Board voted to delay a decision on the letter and instead voted to send a letter to the state board requesting that they advise them on how to proceed.\n\nThe advice from the state came as no surprise, and was consistent with actions being taken throughout the South. Just a year before after the first Brown Vs. Board decision, Virginia ‘s attorney general had ruled to proceed as always with segregated schools. The advice was, therefore, in keeping with that. The state board instructed school systems to remain segregated while the state worked on the problem.\n\nIn August 1955, the Gray Commission was established by Governor Thomas Bahnson Stanley in response to U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd’s call for “massive resistance” to “radical desegregation.”\n\nChaired by State Senator Garland Gray the commission came up with a strategy to defy the court decision. The strategy included three recommendations:\n\n- That laws concerning school attendance be amended so that no child would be required to attend an integrated school,\n- That funds be allocated as tuition grants for parents who opposed schools comprised of white and black students, and\n- That local school boards be authorized to assign white and African American students to particular schools.\n\nWhile the strategy of the Gray Commission was supposed to make integration more difficult by leaving the action up to the local boards, Johnson saw in the final recommendation another opportunity to push for integration at the local level.\n\nOn November 15, 1955 after reviewing the Gray Commission’s statement, Johnson made a proposal to the Falls Church School Board stating, “That the School Board in Falls Church announce as its policy for 1956-57 to permit all negro children living within the city limits of Falls Church to attend the Falls Church public schools according to our present school districting…”\n\nJohnson also stated his opposition to the recommendation by the commission that school systems pay for white students to attend private schools, as he said with less than 10% of the City’s students comprised of African Americans, it would be economically disastrous for areas like Falls Church to support private institutions for white students.\n\nOnce again Johnson’s recommendation had trouble finding support. In a surprisingly candid description in the official minutes of the meeting, the different arguments for and against Johnson’s proposal were laid out.\n\nDirectly opposing Johnson’s plan was Richard Saintsing, who stated that no action be taken on the Supreme Court’s decision until after a so-called Limited Constitutional Convention proposed by Governor Stanley.\n\nIn guarded support of integration was John W. Wells. He proposed that the schools integrate gradually starting with the first grade.\n\nA third position was taken by Jane Dexter, who said that integration was the responsibility of the school board, but that it “should build a climate of feeling in the local community before announcing any policy in this matter.”\n\nThe meeting ended with no decision being made.\n\nThat would prove to be the last time for a while that the issue of desegregation would be recorded as publicly discussed in Falls Church. Within a couple months, the state took complete control of the integration process, threatening any localities that chose to integrate on their own with a complete loss of state funding. With an amendment to the state constitution, Virginia officially staked its resistance to integration.\n\nTo further prevent localities from the integrating, Virginia created the State Pupil Placement Board, a body that for the next four years would decide the placement of students throughout Virginia. With this decision, Falls Church had lost all hope of deciding its own fate.\n\nIn 1958, with a new job as general counsel for NASA, Johnson and his family moved out of Falls Church to Arlington. Though he had managed to keep the Falls Church school system well funded, he hadn’t been able to change its practice of segregation.\n\n“It was really an idea whose time had not quite come to Falls Church,” his daughter said recently, talking with the News-Press.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until four years later when Falls Church would once again be able to take on the challenge of integrating its schools.\n\n_(Part Two next week)._\n\n## Recent News\n\n[![Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\n#### [Beyer Calls For Resignations Of Top Trump Administration Officials Over Massive Security BreachBeyer also calls for “robust” investigation, including appointment of special counsel](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-25](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/25/beyer-calls-for-resignations-of-top-trump-administration-officials-over-massive-security-breachbeyer-also-calls-for-robust-investigation-including-appointment-of-special-counsel/#respond)\n\nMarch 25, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), who represents a Northern Virginia district in the U.S. House…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/)\n\n[![City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162633/City.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\n#### [City Manager Proposes Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and CIP](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-24](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/24/city-manager-proposes-fiscal-year-2026-budget-and-cip/#respond)\n\nMonday, March 24, 2025 — During tonight’s City Council meeting, Falls Church City Manager Wyatt Shields proposed a Fiscal Year 2026 (FY2026)…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/)\n\n[![Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://fcnpwebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11171320/BeyerCongress.png)](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\n#### [Beyer Leads Call for Changes to Ensure Aviation Safety at National Airport](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/)\n\nPosted by [FCNP.com](https://www.fcnp.com/author/fcnp-com/)[2025-03-22](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/)Comments: [0](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/22/beyer-leads-call-for-changes-to-ensure-aviation-safety-at-national-airport/#respond)\n\nMarch 21, 2025 (Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Representative Don Beyer (D-VA), joined by Representatives André Carson (D-IN), Gerry Connolly (D-VA),…\n\n[Read More](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/)\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\n[PrevPreviousSubscribe to the News-Press](https://www.fcnp.com/2000/11/16/subscription/)\n\n[NextM.E.

Two Sundays ago, the City of Falls Church honored teacher, principal and community activist Mary Ellen Henderson with the dedication of a new middle school named for her. In speeches by local, state and federal officials, Henderson was celebrated for her work bringing awareness to the condition of segregated black schools in Falls Church and Fairfax County.

But though she taught for decades and managed to instigate the building of a new school for black students in Falls Church, by the time she retired, the greatest inequality still existed. Segregation still reigned in Virginia , and blacks were still forced to attend different schools from white students. It wasn’t until the Supreme Court in the mid-1950s stepped in that localities were forced to take action to integrate, and in Virginia in some cases, that took over a decade.

The 1950s struggle to develop and integrate a new school system in the newly-independent City of Falls Church was an heroic and monumental undertaking in its own right, a struggle from which emerged yet another unsung champion, school board chairman John Alvin Johnson.

While Mr. Johnson’s seminal role will be detailed below, we begin this story with an overview of how the newly-established jurisdiction with its own, brand new school system and tasked with winning public support for building its schools and hiring a quality staff while working out its own identity apart from Fairfax County, dealt with segregation in its classrooms. It’s a story about striving to develop a City atmosphere that included a changing paradigm of the traditional educational system in the context of a Southern culture, centuries old.

This article tracks from the moment the Supreme Court made “Brown Vs. Board of Education” ruling on segregation in 1954, the tense discussion going on in the City of Falls Church about whether to integrate. And explains why it wasn’t until six years after the Supreme Court’s second Brown Vs. Board of Education ruling in 1955 that Falls Church became only the second school district in Virginia to admit black students into its classroom.

Most people think the integration of Southern schools began on May 17, 1954 , the day that the Supreme Court decided in the case of Brown vs. Board of Education that the “separate but equal” clause long applied to segregated schools was unconstitutional.

But, actually, it wasn’t until May 31, 1955 that, in a second ruling, the Supreme Court made the decision on the pace at which school systems had to desegregate. In three famous words, “all deliberate speed,” the Supreme Court set in motion a process that would take years, as school systems throughout the South wrestled with and resisted the integration of black students into previously all-white schools.

In some school districts like Prince Edward County in central Virginia, the resistance was so great that the school system ultimately closed the doors of the public schools for five years rather than allow black students to share a classroom with white students. In other localities the resistance wasn’t so great. But as the responsibility of integration shifted back and forth between state and local governments, each jurisdiction was forced to deal with the issue of ending a system of racial separation as old as the colonization of the New World .

**A City Divided**

In discussing the path towards desegregation, it is first necessary to understand the overall political climate of a City that was just starting out.

It was only six years before the Supreme Court decision on segregation that Falls Church became an independent city, separating itself from Fairfax County on August 15, 1948. Though several reasons were cited at the time including taxes and roads, still active City resident Jessie Thackrey, whose husband Franklin Thackrey helped compose the new city charter, explained in an interview with the News-Press recently that the primary reason for the separation was the desire to have control over an independent school system. It was the feeling of many in Falls Church at the time that under Fairfax County governance, Falls Church schools were under-funded.

But the central role the schools played in the creation of the new jurisdiction also put them at the heart of the debate about the direction of the City. On one side was a new wave of young parents, the “young Turks,” as one of their still thriving number, Lou Olom described them in his recent News-Press interview. Many of these “young Turks” had recently moved to the area, bringing with them advanced degrees, government jobs and quite often, liberal politics.

On the other side were the long-time residents of the small Virginia village, many of whom had family that lived in the area for generations and whose cultural views were much more in tune with the traditional Southern lifestyles that included an ingrained belief in segregation.

So, like the other school systems in Virginia and throughout the rest of the South, the new Falls Church school system began segregated. White students attended schools in the City but since there weren’t any black schools in the small City, all the black students in Falls Church had to attend schools in Fairfax County. Falls Church paid tuition to the county for these students, who totaled only 30 in 1955.

The reason for the small number of African American students in Falls Church was largely due to a decision made in 1887 when Falls Church was just a town. The town leadership voted to cut their town’s size in half, annexing to Fairfax County the area south of Lee Highway known as the “colored settlement.” The decision meant that the City of Falls Church would remain mostly Caucasian, even to this day.

But in the early 1950’s the focus of the community was much more about the overall philosophy of education and the amount of funding going to the schools, than about the status of its black students. While the City had been founded as an independent jurisdiction in 1948 by those who seeking more school funding, by the beginning of the 1950’s there was already a reaction from residents who thought that too many of the City’s resources were going to the schools.

One year after becoming an independent city, in 1949 the City Council passed a $700,000 school bond issue for the building of two new schools. Then, as the 1951 election rolled around, the Council placed a referendum on the ballot requesting another $500,000 bond, half of which would go towards the schools.

Despite the need for new facilities and salaries, there were those in the City who were nervous about that amount of money going to the schools. The request for more money accompanied by attacks from the opposition, galvanized the conservative members of the City, made up largely of small business owners and long term residents. So, in the June 1951 election, the Council that had led the establishment of the independent City just three years prior was voted out of office.

Four months later, six of the seven members of the School Board, which had been appointed by the council, resigned _en masse_ after suffering accusations of mismanagement by a community group calling itself the Falls Church Emergency Schools Committee. The accusations had been made prior to the election, but with the new Council in place the charges were now backed up at City Hall. The board was then replaced with six new members hand-picked by the new Council.

Only one member remained from that original board, our aforementioned Mr. John Alvin Johnson. Mr. Johnson had been overseas during the controversy, doing work for the Air Force. Following the mass resignation of the six School Board members, he was asked whether he would resign as well. He refused, choosing instead to remain on the board, a decision that would prove to be important in the tumultuous years ahead.

“We were lucky to have him there,” Mrs. Thackrey said in her interview with the News-Press. She told of how over the next six years as chairman for the School Board, Johnson fought tooth and nail for continued funding of the schools, despite resistance from a school board largely in favor of cutting the school budget.

But Johnson’s fight on the school board went beyond budgets and school funding when, in 1955, the Supreme Court decision brought desegregation to the forefront. From the time of the Supreme Court decision, he stood alone as the only board member to stand openly for the immediate integration of the Falls Church schools.

**A Man and His Cause**

By 1951, in the brief time since he came to Falls Church, Johnson had gained a reputation as a brilliant mind and skilled leader. Though he would end up living in Falls Church only eight years, those he worked with remember him to this day with great respect and admiration.

Of Norwegian descent, John Johnson was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and spent most of his youth in Hammond, Indiana, a suburb of Chicago. In 1937 he received his bachelor’s degree from DePauw University and a year later, while earning his law degree from the University of Chicago, met Harriet, the woman he would be married to for 67 years until his death just this summer.

During World War II, Johnson served as a naval officer on the destroyer USS Robert H. Smith, which took part in the invasion of Iwo Jima in the Pacific campaign.

After returning from the war, Johnson went back to school to get his master’s degree in law from Harvard University.

In 1949, while working for the State Department, Johnson and his wife moved to Falls Church, just as it was becoming an independent jurisdiction. Immediately Johnson became a charter member of the newly forming city.

In 1952, as he was working on the Falls Church School Board, Johnson was general counsel for the Air Force, a job he held until 1958, when he moved to Arlington and became general counsel for NASA.

He would later go on to an impressive career in the field of satellite communications, serving as international vice president for the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat) then as president of Comsat General Corporation.

Described as a deeply religious man, Johnson was a member of the Church of Christ , located in the Culmore area in Falls Church , for over 50 years, serving as a deacon and elder, and helping promote mission work throughout South and Central America , often spending a significant amount of time traveling to those countries bringing aid.

With a history of working towards human rights it is no surprise that during the 1950’s he would champion the issue of integration.

From the time he and his wife moved into Falls Church, Johnson was intent on doing something about segregation. His daughter Barbara Groff, who now lives in Reedville , Virginia with her husband, said that at a very early age she was aware of her father’s concern. She remembers vividly her father’s insistence on fair treatment regardless of race or nationality, and also how disturbed he was by living in an area where bigotry was so accepted.

“He was quite discouraged about it,” Groff said.

**The Beginning of a Fight**

With the second Supreme Court Brown Vs. Board of Education ruling in 1955, Johnson, who had been meeting regularly with leaders of the African American community (including E.B. Henderson, husband of Mary Ellen Henderson), thought he saw an opening, since the ruling called for integration with “all deliberate speed.” On June 2, just three days after the Supreme Court’s decision, Johnson, as chairman of the School Board, submitted to the board a letter that he’d written and wanted to send to the state Board of Education concerning the integration of the Falls Church schools.

In the letter, Johnson noted the small number of African American students in the Falls Church school district and that there would be little burden placed on the school system from integrating those students into the Falls Church schools.

He wrote: “The Falls Church School Board sees no administrative obstacles to the admission of Negro pupils to the Falls Church public schools. Their number is so small that no increase in either physical facilities or teaching staff would be required for the coming school year if all of them were to be admitted to the Falls Church schools at the opening of school in September 1955.”

But despite his arguments for immediate desegregation, the letter was never sent to the state board. The Falls Church School Board voted to delay a decision on the letter and instead voted to send a letter to the state board requesting that they advise them on how to proceed.

The advice from the state came as no surprise, and was consistent with actions being taken throughout the South. Just a year before after the first Brown Vs. Board decision, Virginia ‘s attorney general had ruled to proceed as always with segregated schools. The advice was, therefore, in keeping with that. The state board instructed school systems to remain segregated while the state worked on the problem.

In August 1955, the Gray Commission was established by Governor Thomas Bahnson Stanley in response to U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd’s call for “massive resistance” to “radical desegregation.”

Chaired by State Senator Garland Gray the commission came up with a strategy to defy the court decision. The strategy included three recommendations:

- That laws concerning school attendance be amended so that no child would be required to attend an integrated school,
- That funds be allocated as tuition grants for parents who opposed schools comprised of white and black students, and
- That local school boards be authorized to assign white and African American students to particular schools.

While the strategy of the Gray Commission was supposed to make integration more difficult by leaving the action up to the local boards, Johnson saw in the final recommendation another opportunity to push for integration at the local level.

On November 15, 1955 after reviewing the Gray Commission’s statement, Johnson made a proposal to the Falls Church School Board stating, “That the School Board in Falls Church announce as its policy for 1956-57 to permit all negro children living within the city limits of Falls Church to attend the Falls Church public schools according to our present school districting…”

Johnson also stated his opposition to the recommendation by the commission that school systems pay for white students to attend private schools, as he said with less than 10% of the City’s students comprised of African Americans, it would be economically disastrous for areas like Falls Church to support private institutions for white students.

Once again Johnson’s recommendation had trouble finding support. In a surprisingly candid description in the official minutes of the meeting, the different arguments for and against Johnson’s proposal were laid out.

Directly opposing Johnson’s plan was Richard Saintsing, who stated that no action be taken on the Supreme Court’s decision until after a so-called Limited Constitutional Convention proposed by Governor Stanley.

In guarded support of integration was John W. Wells. He proposed that the schools integrate gradually starting with the first grade.

A third position was taken by Jane Dexter, who said that integration was the responsibility of the school board, but that it “should build a climate of feeling in the local community before announcing any policy in this matter.”

The meeting ended with no decision being made.

That would prove to be the last time for a while that the issue of desegregation would be recorded as publicly discussed in Falls Church. Within a couple months, the state took complete control of the integration process, threatening any localities that chose to integrate on their own with a complete loss of state funding. With an amendment to the state constitution, Virginia officially staked its resistance to integration.

To further prevent localities from the integrating, Virginia created the State Pupil Placement Board, a body that for the next four years would decide the placement of students throughout Virginia. With this decision, Falls Church had lost all hope of deciding its own fate.

In 1958, with a new job as general counsel for NASA, Johnson and his family moved out of Falls Church to Arlington. Though he had managed to keep the Falls Church school system well funded, he hadn’t been able to change its practice of segregation.

“It was really an idea whose time had not quite come to Falls Church,” his daughter said recently, talking with the News-Press.

It wouldn’t be until four years later when Falls Church would once again be able to take on the challenge of integrating its schools.

# Account of Randolph-Clay Duel Near Little Falls Bridge

## Transcription Excerpt (Relevant Portion)

The meeting was to take place on the right bank of the Potomac, near the Little Falls Bridge, and within the edge of the Virginia line, which there approaches near to the river. Mr. Randolph had chosen it himself. He wished, if he fell, to fall upon the soil of Virginia; and as he did not mean to fire at Mr Clay, he felt it to be no infraction of her statute against duelling, to go within her limits for the mere purpose of receiving the fire of his adversary. His words to me were: I break no law of Virginia. I neither accept a challenge within her limits, nor do I fight a duel within them. The seconds on both sides had agreed that I might be at hand, when the meeting took place, for the purpose of interposing my mediation at the first practicable moment. Availing myself of this permission I followed on behind the parties, crossed the Little Falls Bridge just after them, and came to the place where the servants and carriages had stopped.

## Historical Context

This 1826 account, written by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, describes the famous duel between Secretary of State Henry Clay and Senator John Randolph of Virginia. The duel, which took place on April 8, 1826, arose from harsh criticism Randolph had made of Clay in a Senate speech. Although both men fired, neither was seriously injured, and they reconciled immediately afterward.

The document provides valuable insights into the code of honor that governed political disputes in early America, as well as the complicated legal and geographical considerations that went into planning such encounters. Dueling was illegal in most states, including Virginia, which is why the specific location for this high-profile duel required careful consideration.

Most significantly for geographical research, the document specifically identifies "Little Falls Bridge" and the "right bank of the Potomac" as recognizable landmarks, establishing that "Little Falls" was a well-known and commonly referenced geographical location in the Washington area by 1826.

## Significance of "Little Falls" Reference

This 1826 document contains several important geographical references:

1. **Little Falls Bridge** - The explicit naming of this bridge demonstrates that "Little Falls" was an established geographical designation used for navigation and reference.

2. **The Virginia Line** - The document notes the Virginia boundary approaching the river near Little Falls, showing the geographical and political significance of the area.

3. **Right Bank of the Potomac** - The technical geographical description indicates familiarity with the Little Falls area's topography.

The account establishes that by 1826, "Little Falls" was:

1. A sufficiently prominent geographical feature to have a bridge named after it
2. A recognized landmark for giving directions
3. A place with enough significance that a U.S. Senator would choose it specifically as the location for what might have been his final moments

This reference demonstrates that "Little Falls" was not merely a minor geographical designation but a recognized and significant place name in the early 19th century, used by prominent political figures and understood by the reading public.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1826 document provides additional historical evidence supporting the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Early Usage**: This reference to "Little Falls" predates the 1839 "Fall's Church" vestry notice and the 1802 "Fall's Church road" mention, demonstrating that "Little Falls" was an established geographical name in the region before the church name became prominent in written records.

2. **Geographic Primacy**: The document shows that the "Little Falls" name was tied to a significant geographical feature (the falls on the Potomac) that was prominent enough to have infrastructure (a bridge) named after it.

3. **Historical Connection**: The connection of this location to a famous historical event involving prominent national figures (Clay and Randolph) adds cultural and historical weight to the "Little Falls" name.

4. **Washington Area Reference**: The document establishes "Little Falls" as a recognized location in the broader Washington area, supporting the argument that the name has regional historical significance.

This 1826 reference to "Little Falls" provides evidence that the geographical feature was prominent enough to serve as a landmark and reference point in the early 19th century, strengthening the case that "Little Falls" has deep historical roots in the region's geography and would be an historically appropriate choice for renaming Falls Church.

# Dulany Slave and Property Sale Advertisement

## Transcription

September 4.

FOR SALE,
A few likely NEGROES.
For terms, apply to
BENJAMIN DULANY,
Who will offer at Public Sale, on the first of November next, at his plantation near the Falls Church,
All his Stock & Farming Utensils,
of every description,
On a credit of 6 months—the purchasers giving bond with good security for the payment.
September 5.

## Historical Context

This advertisement from 1805 represents the disturbing reality of slavery in early America, including the Falls Church area. Benjamin Dulany, a member of the prominent Dulany family of Maryland and Virginia, was liquidating both human property (enslaved people) and farming equipment from his plantation near Falls Church.

The advertisement illustrates several aspects of the economy and society of the time:

1. The casual dehumanization of enslaved persons, referred to as "likely NEGROES" - a common term in slave sales indicating individuals who were considered physically capable and healthy

2. The approach to selling human beings as property alongside farm equipment and livestock

3. The extension of credit (6 months) for purchasers, indicating the financial scale of these sales

4. The continued presence of large slaveholding plantations in the Falls Church area into the early 19th century

The Dulany family was prominent in colonial and early American Virginia. They owned significant property and were influential in political and economic circles. This advertisement indicates that Benjamin Dulany may have been reducing his holdings or possibly relocating, as he was selling "All his Stock & Farming Utensils" as well as enslaved people.

This document, while deeply troubling in its content, provides important historical evidence of the economic and social structures that defined this period of Falls Church history and the centrality of the institution of slavery to the local economy and society.

### **Summary**

On June 15, 2024, the Tinner Hill Foundation will dedicate a new mural on the side of the Ace Tool Rental building at 7131 South Washington Street (Route 29).

The Arts and Humanities Council (AHC) discussed in March 2024 proposals for a sculpture at Founders Row II and a mural at West Falls and were shown the winning designs for utility box art to be installed on four additional traffic control boxes around the City.

The City has issued a request for quotation calling for art for City Council chambers. Responses are due June 14, 2024.

At present, the Planning Commission ultimately approves public artwork and looks to the Architectural Advisory Board (AAB) and the AHC for recommendations. A new policy intended to bring more order to the process is under consideration and will be discussed in a future post.

### **Tinner Hill mural**

The new [Tinner Hill](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/) mural on the side of the Ace Tool Rental building on South Washington Street was several years in the making. The initial idea came from former City resident Peter Adriance who connected the Tinner Hill Historical Foundation (THHF) with the owner of Ace, Bryce Schwarzmann. Mr. Schwarzmann was receptive to the idea, and the THHF Mural Committee worked to turn the concept into reality. The committee consisted of THHF board members, Irene Chambers, Mike Everette, Nikki Graves Henderson, and members of the Social Justice Committee of Falls Church and Vicinity as well as Tinner Hill family members, including Rebecca Tinner.

Funding for the mural came from the City, the Community Foundation of Northern Virginia, Arts and Humanities Council grants, City resident Kenneth Feltman, and others.

The committee gathered input from the community, including neighborhood businesses. They then worked with artist Bryan King on the design. In the final mural, shown below, the images in the letters are taken from the THHF archives. Tinner Hill Road with its historical homes forms the background. The milkman and his van were inspired by Mr. Schwarzmann’s father who was a milkman. The mural will be formally dedicated on June 15, 2024.

### **Founders Row II sculpture**

![Founders Row II artwork sculpture location](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/FR-II-plaza-rendering-art-location.jpg)Location of sculpture on the Founders Row II plaza is marked in red.

The City required the Founders Row II development to include public art. Chad Price of Mill Creek, the developer, and Barton Rubenstein, sculptor and public artist, presented two works by Mr. Rubenstein to be considered for the plaza at Founders Row II, now under construction at the intersection of Broad and West Streets. The plan shows the location of the plaza along South West Street. The sculpture would be located on the corner of the entrance to the plaza in a 16-20ft by 4ft space near the road.

The two works offered are shown below. Both works utilize a brushed stainless steel finish that weathers well over time. They are also wind kinetic and so move and would be surrounded by vegetation, but are not designed for people to climb or sit on them.

![Migration by Barton Rubenstein](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-FR-II-Migration.jpg)“Migration” by Barton Rubenstein

“Migration” is a tribute to efforts to restore the shad population in the Potomac River. Each undulating fish is 4ft high, 8ft wide, and 1.5ft thick.

![Artwork: River grass by Barton Rubenstein](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-FR-II-River-Grass.jpg)“River Grass” by Barton Rubenstein

“River Grass” is a tribute to the eelgrass that is an important part of the marine ecosystem in the Potomac River.  The sculpture comprises two elements, 20ft and 16ft tall, respectively, that are designed to rotate slowly when the wind blows.

### **Behind the scenes: A convoluted path for selecting art for [Founders Row II](https://fallschurchpulse.org/a-founders-row-ii-primer/)**

The City’s Arts and Humanities Council (AHC) expected its recommendation on the nature of the sculpture and its best placement to be adopted but does not think that happened. There was no opportunity for citizen input, and the sculpture’s location became an issue.  Both the artist and the AHC wanted the sculpture placed either in the center or on the edge of the plaza at the midpoint along West Street.  However, the developer opposed locating it as part of the plaza.  Currently, the sculpture is slated to sit in the entrance aisle to the plaza.

Mill Creek presented the two options to the Architectural Advisory Board (AAB) at its June 14, 2023, meeting. AAB members expressed a preference for the “River Grass” sculpture because of safety concerns regarding the “Migration” sculpture. They worried that people would try to climb the 4ft-high fishes that are not designed for such physical interaction. They thought the “River Grass” sculpture would more safely tolerate physical contact from people, and that the the design would better fit in the narrow space afforded by the entrance to the plaza.

By contrast after a similar presentation from the developer, the AHC expressed a strong preference for the “Migration” sculpture at their June 15, 2023, meeting, but thought either design would work.

Mill Creek then submitted “River Grass” to the Planning Commission at their December 6, 2023, meeting, and the Commission voted to return the application to the AAB and the AHC for further review. The AAB approved the submission at their meeting a week later. However, in January the AHC voted to send the Planning Commission a letter saying they disagreed and recommended the “Migration” sculpture.  In March 2024, the Commission asked the AHC to revisit their decision.

AHC members believed that people on the plaza would interact with the “Migration” sculpture more than they would “River Grass,” which they considered too tall and _“out of scale”_ with the available area. They also maintained that the placement of the fishes just behind the glass railings would give the positive effect of an aquarium. Further, the AHC liked the _“story-telling aspect”_ of the sculpture, relating it to human migration through Falls Church.

Sculptor Rubenstein concluded that the ultimate decision should be based on _“which kind of sculpture do you want? For the people walking up to the plaza, or_\[to\] _announce, ‘We have arrived!’.”_

In the end, the AHC voted 5-4 to approve the developer’s submission of “River Grass” to the Planning Commission. The application now returns to the Commission for final approval.

### **The West Falls mural**

West Falls developer Hoffman & Associates presented two proposals for the mural to “beautify” the unfinished concrete wall of the multistory garage that can be seen from Haycock Road. A multifamily condominium is planned for the area between the garage and Haycock Road in Phase 2 of the West Falls development project. However, as that is some years away, the City Council required artwork for the blank wall that many have complained is an eyesore, and the developer proposed a mural.

Commissioned to design the mural, artist Juan Pineda offered two designs shown below. The ACH selected the “West Falls VA State” mural and asked for modifications that would identify the artwork more closely with the City, such as the addition of oak trees and the Tinner Hill Arch. The Falls Church Episcopal from which the City takes its name is depicted with the purple roof and red doors at the midpoint of the bottom of the mural. The mural installation is underway.

### **City-initiated public artwork**

![utility box artwork at Falls Church city hall.](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-City-Hall-utility-box-art-reduced.jpg)Utility box art near City Hall

Before the COVID pandemic, the AHC implemented one “art wrapped”utility box as public art at the intersection of Park Avenue and Little Falls Street (shown at right).  More recently, the City issued a call for proposals to artists for artwork for four more utility boxes in Falls Church. The winning artists will each receive $1,250 for their designs, and the City will own the rights to their work. The City will install the selected designs as vinyl (or similar) wraps on the utility boxes.

The winning entries are shown below, with a picture of the utility box and location for each artwork. Each piece will include QR codes for information from the artist about the work. Staff hope the artwork will be installed by the end of summer.

![Utility box artwork](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-utility-box-art-combined.jpg)

### **Portraits for City Council chambers**

The City also plans to diversify the art in City Council chambers. Currently, portraits of four Founding Fathers donated by the Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS) decorate the chamber walls. A request for quotations (RFQ) released in May 2024, seeks to add two more pieces of art to this central meeting space.

The RFQ provides suggestions of people, places, or events that artists may want to incorporate, such as:

**People:** Frederick Forrest Foote Jr., Barb Cram, Mary Riley Styles, Edwin B. and Mary Ellen Henderson, Joseph Tinner, and Harriet Brice.

**Places:** The Falls Church, Cherry Hill Farmhouse and Barn, the Eden Center, the Tinner Hill Arch, the Farmers’ Market, the W&OD Trail and Bridge, Brown’s Hardware.

**Stories:** History of the land (indigenous through present day); the influence of women, Black and African Americans, and Vietnamese and Asian Americans in the City; and the formation of the Falls Church City Public School District.

Preference will be given to proposals that expand recognition of all City of Falls Church history and stories not already depicted in the City’s public art. Electronic submissions are due June 14, 2024, by 5:00 pm.

**Update**

City Council voted unanimously to approve the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District at their June 24, 2024, meeting. The main change to the initial draft was to not separately identify a core district but to identify the entire area as one. The final Comprehensive Plan amendment (Chapter 3) can be found here : [The Tinner Hill Historic & Cultural District](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/21046/Tinner-Hill-Historic-and-Cultural-District_FINAL).

## Summary

At the City Council meeting on January 16, 2024, City staff presented an amendment to the City’s Comprehensive Plan to establish the Tinner Hill area as an historic and cultural district. This is the culmination of the efforts of the Falls Church Historical Commission and the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation to recognize the struggles and achievements of the African American community who lived there, especially in their fight against segregation laws that the Town Council of Falls Church passed in 1915.

## **Background: A brief history of Tinner Hill**

The Tinner Hill and surrounding area was once home to a thriving African American community. Tinner Hill takes its name from its residents, patriarch Charles Tinner and his family, who were stone masons. The pink granite they favored came from the nearby Tripp’s quarry. Like many African American communities in Virginia, they were subject to segregation and Jim Crow laws.

Between 1887 and 1890, Falls Church retroceded over a third of its land to Fairfax County to reduce the number of black voters, who were almost entirely Republicans as opposed to the whites who were Democrats. The gerrymandering reduced the percentage of black voters from an estimated 37% to 15%. (In 1873 there were 632 registered voters of whom 232 were black.) Tinner Hill today lies partially in Fairfax County and the City.

![1890 Map showing the boundary change when a large section of Tinner Hill was retroceded to Fairfax County](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-retroceded-map.jpg)1890 Map depicting the change in the town boundary in Tinner Hill. Photo courtesy of Mary Riley Styles Library.

Then in 1915, the Town Council of Falls Church passed a discriminatory law segregating most of Falls Church as a “white district” where blacks would not be able to purchase or rent property, and 5% of the area to blacks. There are property deeds in the City that carry racially restrictive covenants that reflect this law. An example taken from the 1922 deed records for the Woodland subdivision, the area between Pennsylvania Avenue and N Oak Street, is shown below.

New York Avenue was renamed N Lee Street. Courtesy of Rachel Swann.

Despite cross burnings and a strong Ku Klux Clan presence, E.B. Henderson and Joseph Tinner led a successful challenge to prevent that law from being enforced. The first rural chapter of the NCAAP was established here as a result of their activism.

Local historian, Edwin B. Henderson, has written a post about the African American experience in [Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/). The [Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation website](https://www.tinnerhill.org/) contains photos and source documents of the history. Tinner Hill is also the subject of a Virginia Tech study of how history impacts landscape in  [“Tinner Hill: A Witness to Civil Rights”](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=2536&meta_id=128974), by Anna Buczkowska, Basem Saah, and Paul Kelsch. The video below, produced by the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation, highlights the Tinner Hill history (10min).

## **Amendment to establish the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District**

Edwin B. Henderson, founder of the [Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation](https://www.tinnerhill.org/), and Ronald Anzalone, chair of the Falls Church Historical Commission, have worked for many years to educate and inform

the City on the rich African American history of the Tinner Hill area.  A formal request [\[EH1\]](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#_msocom_1)  was submitted to City Council by the Historical Commission in a [memorandum](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=2536&meta_id=128973) on April 17, 2023. Their efforts led to the City proposing an amendment to the City’s [Comprehensive Plan](http://www.fallschurchva.gov/1984/Comprehensive-Plan) to establish the Tinner Hill area as an historic and cultural district. (The Comprehensive Plan serves as a blueprint for development in the City.) The designation of “historic and cultural” is honorific and would not impact zoning, permitting, or taxation.

![Map of proposed tinner Hill historic and cultural district](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-proposed-historic-and-cultural-district-map.jpg)Proposed Map of Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District

The proposed district includes two areas – The Core area and Related Sites outside the core. The Core is a cluster of historic and cultural sites currently located in Tinner Hill that are significant to the original community. The following sites, shown on the map, encompass the Core of the Tinner Hill Historic & Cultural District:

1. Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner House
2. Joseph and Mary Tinner Home Outline (demolished)
3. The Henderson House, home of civil rights leader E.B. Henderson and his school teacher wife, Mary Ellen Henderson ~~.~~
4. The Tinner Hill Civil Rights Monument
5. The Tinner Hill Historic Site Marker
6. [The Zig Zag (Adinkra) Sculpture](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=187038) – follows the gerrymandering border of 1887

Outside of this Core area:

7. The Tripps Quarry where the Tinners worked
8. [The Galloway United Methodist Church](https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/galloway-methodist-church)
9. Written in Stone Walking Trail

The amendment will include brief biographies of key leaders and historic figures associated with the Tinner Hill community. They include Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner, Edwin Bancroft (E.B.) Henderson, Eliza Henderson, George and Harriet Brice, Harriet Foote Turner, Joseph Tinner, and Mary Ellen Henderson.

## Council Discussion

The City Council was unanimously supportive of this amendment. Councilmember **Marybeth Connelly** pointed out that the road is called “Tinners Hill” while the district is called “Tinner Hill.” She also suggested that the area’s women’s history sites be included in the newly defined district. Ms. Connelly further asked that the proposed Rolling Road Park in the [Quinn Homestretch](https://fallschurchpulse.org/topics/projects/quinn-homestretch/) project be included. Rolling Road Park intends to honor the African American history of that area.

Councilmember **David Snyder** asked that the history section of the amendment include the City Council’s repudiation of the segregation law of 1915 in 1999. (When the City of Falls Church was incorporated in 1948, this law was not included in its articles. Nonetheless, the City Council chose to formally repudiate it in 1999.) He also asked that the amendment acknowledge the work with the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation and the county on the Civil Rights Monuments, the Civil Rights Center, etc., to bring the history up to date.

Councilmember **Erin Flynn** suggested that the work be coordinated with Fairfax County as the area extends into Fairfax County. She hoped that public engagements regarding the amendment would help identify the historical elements on which to focus and explore how to present them effectively. (Fairfax County already recognizes many Tinner Hill sites as historic sites.)

Councilmember **Justine Underhill** asked if there would be a move to “downzone” the area in recognition of its historical significance. City Manager Wyatt Shields replied that while it is not in this amendment, some residents of Tinners Hill Road and Liberty Avenue have asked for a rezoning of the area from Commercial to Residential. That issue will be discussed at a later date.

Councilmember **Caroline Lian** asked whether there should be a distinction between the Core area and the wider area, and whether the boundary should be expanded to include the Rolling Road Park. Staff explained that the Core area was drawn around the original area of Tinner Hill where most of the historical sites are located.

## What happens next?

The amendment will be brought before the Planning Commission and opened to the wider community, boards, and commissions for input. Staff expect this amendment to return to the City Council for final consideration in May.

Tinner Hill takes its name from its residents, patriarch Charles Tinner and his family, who were stone masons. The pink granite they favored came from the nearby Tripp’s quarry. Like many African American communities in Virginia, they were subject to segregation and Jim Crow laws.\n\nBetween 1887 and 1890, Falls Church retroceded over a third of its land to Fairfax County to reduce the number of black voters, who were almost entirely Republicans as opposed to the whites who were Democrats. The gerrymandering reduced the percentage of black voters from an estimated 37% to 15%. (In 1873 there were 632 registered voters of whom 232 were black.) Tinner Hill today lies partially in Fairfax County and the City.\n\n![1890 Map showing the boundary change when a large section of Tinner Hill was retroceded to Fairfax County](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-retroceded-map.jpg)1890 Map depicting the change in the town boundary in Tinner Hill. Photo courtesy of Mary Riley Styles Library.\n\nThen in 1915, the Town Council of Falls Church passed a discriminatory law segregating most of Falls Church as a “white district” where blacks would not be able to purchase or rent property, and 5% of the area to blacks. There are property deeds in the City that carry racially restrictive covenants that reflect this law. An example taken from the 1922 deed records for the Woodland subdivision, the area between Pennsylvania Avenue and N Oak Street, is shown below.\n\n![Part of a Woodland subdivision deed showing racially discriminatory covenant.](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-Covenant-Woodland-Tract-2.jpg)Section of a Woodland Subdivision deed with a racial covenant (1922). New York Avenue was renamed N Lee Street. Courtesy of Rachel Swann.\n\nDespite cross burnings and a strong Ku Klux Clan presence, E.B. Henderson and Joseph Tinner led a successful challenge to prevent that law from being enforced. The first rural chapter of the NCAAP was established here as a result of their activism.\n\nLocal historian, Edwin B. Henderson, has written a post about the African American experience in [Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/). The [Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation website](https://www.tinnerhill.org/) contains photos and source documents of the history. Tinner Hill is also the subject of a Virginia Tech study of how history impacts landscape in  [“Tinner Hill: A Witness to Civil Rights”](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=2536&meta_id=128974), by Anna Buczkowska, Basem Saah, and Paul Kelsch.

Henderson, founder of the [Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation](https://www.tinnerhill.org/), and Ronald Anzalone, chair of the Falls Church Historical Commission, have worked for many years to educate and inform\n\nthe City on the rich African American history of the Tinner Hill area.  A formal request [\\[EH1\\]](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#_msocom_1)  was submitted to City Council by the Historical Commission in a [memorandum](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=2536&meta_id=128973) on April 17, 2023. Their efforts led to the City proposing an amendment to the City’s [Comprehensive Plan](http://www.fallschurchva.gov/1984/Comprehensive-Plan) to establish the Tinner Hill area as an historic and cultural district. (The Comprehensive Plan serves as a blueprint for development in the City.) The designation of “historic and cultural” is honorific and would not impact zoning, permitting, or taxation.\n\n![Map of proposed tinner Hill historic and cultural district](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-proposed-historic-and-cultural-district-map.jpg)Proposed Map of Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District\n\nThe proposed district includes two areas – The Core area and Related Sites outside the core. The Core is a cluster of historic and cultural sites currently located in Tinner Hill that are significant to the original community. The following sites, shown on the map, encompass the Core of the Tinner Hill Historic & Cultural District:\n\n1. Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner House\n2. Joseph and Mary Tinner Home Outline (demolished)\n3. The Henderson House, home of civil rights leader E.B. Henderson and his school teacher wife, Mary Ellen Henderson ~~.~~\n4. The Tinner Hill Civil Rights Monument\n5. The Tinner Hill Historic Site Marker\n6. [The Zig Zag (Adinkra) Sculpture](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=187038) – follows the gerrymandering border of 1887\n\nOutside of this Core area:\n\n7. The Tripps Quarry where the Tinners worked\n8. [The Galloway United Methodist Church](https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/galloway-methodist-church)\n9. Written in Stone Walking Trail\n\nThe amendment will include brief biographies of key leaders and historic figures associated with the Tinner Hill community. They include Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner, Edwin Bancroft (E.B.) Henderson, Eliza Henderson, George and Harriet Brice, Harriet Foote Turner, Joseph Tinner, and Mary Ellen Henderson.\n\n## Council Discussion\n\nThe City Council was unanimously supportive of this amendment. Councilmember **Marybeth Connelly** pointed out that the road is called “Tinners Hill” while the district is called “Tinner Hill.” She also suggested that the area’s women’s history sites be included in the newly defined district. Ms. Connelly further asked that the proposed Rolling Road Park in the [Quinn Homestretch](https://fallschurchpulse.org/topics/projects/quinn-homestretch/) project be included. Rolling Road Park intends to honor the African American history of that area.\n\nCouncilmember **David Snyder** asked that the history section of the amendment include the City Council’s repudiation of the segregation law of 1915 in 1999. (When the City of Falls Church was incorporated in 1948, this law was not included in its articles. Nonetheless, the City Council chose to formally repudiate it in 1999.) He also asked that the amendment acknowledge the work with the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation and the county on the Civil Rights Monuments, the Civil Rights Center, etc., to bring the history up to date.\n\nCouncilmember **Erin Flynn** suggested that the work be coordinated with Fairfax County as the area extends into Fairfax County. She hoped that public engagements regarding the amendment would help identify the historical elements on which to focus and explore how to present them effectively. (Fairfax County already recognizes many Tinner Hill sites as historic sites.)\n\nCouncilmember **Justine Underhill** asked if there would be a move to “downzone” the area in recognition of its historical significance. City Manager Wyatt Shields replied that while it is not in this amendment, some residents of Tinners Hill Road and Liberty Avenue have asked for a rezoning of the area from Commercial to Residential. That issue will be discussed at a later date.\n\nCouncilmember **Caroline Lian** asked whether there should be a distinction between the Core area and the wider area, and whether the boundary should be expanded to include the Rolling Road Park. Staff explained that the Core area was drawn around the original area of Tinner Hill where most of the historical sites are located.\n\n## What happens next?\n\nThe amendment will be brought before the Planning Commission and opened to the wider community, boards, and commissions for input. Staff expect this amendment to return to the City Council for final consideration in May.\n\n![Photo of Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner House.](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/TH-Charles-Tinner-house-GIS-pic-300x228.jpg)Home of Charles and Mary Elizabeth Tinner, built 1870.

{"success":true,"data":{"markdown":"[Skip to content](https://fallschurchpulse.org/new-public-artwork-2024/#main)\n\n![Public artwork: Tinner Hill mural](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Tinner-Hill-mural-reduced.jpg)\n\n### **Summary**\n\nOn June 15, 2024, the Tinner Hill Foundation will dedicate a new mural on the side of the Ace Tool Rental building at 7131 South Washington Street (Route 29).\n\nThe Arts and Humanities Council (AHC) discussed in March 2024 proposals for a sculpture at Founders Row II and a mural at West Falls and were shown the winning designs for utility box art to be installed on four additional traffic control boxes around the City.\n\nThe City has issued a request for quotation calling for art for City Council chambers. Responses are due June 14, 2024.\n\nAt present, the Planning Commission ultimately approves public artwork and looks to the Architectural Advisory Board (AAB) and the AHC for recommendations. A new policy intended to bring more order to the process is under consideration and will be discussed in a future post.\n\n### **Tinner Hill mural**\n\nThe new [Tinner Hill](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/) mural on the side of the Ace Tool Rental building on South Washington Street was several years in the making. The initial idea came from former City resident Peter Adriance who connected the Tinner Hill Historical Foundation (THHF) with the owner of Ace, Bryce Schwarzmann. Mr. Schwarzmann was receptive to the idea, and the THHF Mural Committee worked to turn the concept into reality. The committee consisted of THHF board members, Irene Chambers, Mike Everette, Nikki Graves Henderson, and members of the Social Justice Committee of Falls Church and Vicinity as well as Tinner Hill family members, including Rebecca Tinner.\n\nFunding for the mural came from the City, the Community Foundation of Northern Virginia, Arts and Humanities Council grants, City resident Kenneth Feltman, and others.\n\nThe committee gathered input from the community, including neighborhood businesses. They then worked with artist Bryan King on the design. In the final mural, shown below, the images in the letters are taken from the THHF archives. Tinner Hill Road with its historical homes forms the background. The milkman and his van were inspired by Mr. Schwarzmann’s father who was a milkman. The mural will be formally dedicated on June 15, 2024.\n\n![Public artwork: Tinner Hill mural](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Tinner-Hill-mural-reduced.jpg)Tinner Hill mural by Bryan King on South Washington Street\n\n### **Founders Row II sculpture**\n\n![Founders Row II artwork sculpture location](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/FR-II-plaza-rendering-art-location.jpg)Location of sculpture on the Founders Row II plaza is marked in red.\n\nThe City required the Founders Row II development to include public art. Chad Price of Mill Creek, the developer, and Barton Rubenstein, sculptor and public artist, presented two works by Mr. Rubenstein to be considered for the plaza at Founders Row II, now under construction at the intersection of Broad and West Streets. The plan shows the location of the plaza along South West Street. The sculpture would be located on the corner of the entrance to the plaza in a 16-20ft by 4ft space near the road.\n\nThe two works offered are shown below. Both works utilize a brushed stainless steel finish that weathers well over time. They are also wind kinetic and so move and would be surrounded by vegetation, but are not designed for people to climb or sit on them.\n\n![Migration by Barton Rubenstein](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-FR-II-Migration.jpg)“Migration” by Barton Rubenstein\n\n“Migration” is a tribute to efforts to restore the shad population in the Potomac River. Each undulating fish is 4ft high, 8ft wide, and 1.5ft thick.\n\n![Artwork: River grass by Barton Rubenstein](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-FR-II-River-Grass.jpg)“River Grass” by Barton Rubenstein\n\n“River Grass” is a tribute to the eelgrass that is an important part of the marine ecosystem in the Potomac River.  The sculpture comprises two elements, 20ft and 16ft tall, respectively, that are designed to rotate slowly when the wind blows.\n\n### **Behind the scenes: A convoluted path for selecting art for [Founders Row II](https://fallschurchpulse.org/a-founders-row-ii-primer/)**\n\nThe City’s Arts and Humanities Council (AHC) expected its recommendation on the nature of the sculpture and its best placement to be adopted but does not think that happened. There was no opportunity for citizen input, and the sculpture’s location became an issue.  Both the artist and the AHC wanted the sculpture placed either in the center or on the edge of the plaza at the midpoint along West Street.  However, the developer opposed locating it as part of the plaza.  Currently, the sculpture is slated to sit in the entrance aisle to the plaza.\n\nMill Creek presented the two options to the Architectural Advisory Board (AAB) at its June 14, 2023, meeting. AAB members expressed a preference for the “River Grass” sculpture because of safety concerns regarding the “Migration” sculpture. They worried that people would try to climb the 4ft-high fishes that are not designed for such physical interaction. They thought the “River Grass” sculpture would more safely tolerate physical contact from people, and that the the design would better fit in the narrow space afforded by the entrance to the plaza.\n\nBy contrast after a similar presentation from the developer, the AHC expressed a strong preference for the “Migration” sculpture at their June 15, 2023, meeting, but thought either design would work.\n\nMill Creek then submitted “River Grass” to the Planning Commission at their December 6, 2023, meeting, and the Commission voted to return the application to the AAB and the AHC for further review. The AAB approved the submission at their meeting a week later. However, in January the AHC voted to send the Planning Commission a letter saying they disagreed and recommended the “Migration” sculpture.  In March 2024, the Commission asked the AHC to revisit their decision.\n\nAHC members believed that people on the plaza would interact with the “Migration” sculpture more than they would “River Grass,” which they considered too tall and _“out of scale”_ with the available area. They also maintained that the placement of the fishes just behind the glass railings would give the positive effect of an aquarium. Further, the AHC liked the _“story-telling aspect”_ of the sculpture, relating it to human migration through Falls Church.\n\nSculptor Rubenstein concluded that the ultimate decision should be based on _“which kind of sculpture do you want? For the people walking up to the plaza, or_\\[to\\] _announce, ‘We have arrived!’.”_\n\nIn the end, the AHC voted 5-4 to approve the developer’s submission of “River Grass” to the Planning Commission. The application now returns to the Commission for final approval.\n\n![Rendition of \"River Grass\" on the Founders Row II plaza.](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-FR-II-rendition-of-River-Grass-on-plaza.jpg)Rendering of Founders Row II with the “River Grass” sculpture.\n\n### **The West Falls mural**\n\nWest Falls developer Hoffman & Associates presented two proposals for the mural to “beautify” the unfinished concrete wall of the multistory garage that can be seen from Haycock Road. A multifamily condominium is planned for the area between the garage and Haycock Road in Phase 2 of the West Falls development project. However, as that is some years away, the City Council required artwork for the blank wall that many have complained is an eyesore, and the developer proposed a mural.\n\nCommissioned to design the mural, artist Juan Pineda offered two designs shown below. The ACH selected the “West Falls VA State” mural and asked for modifications that would identify the artwork more closely with the City, such as the addition of oak trees and the Tinner Hill Arch. The Falls Church Episcopal from which the City takes its name is depicted with the purple roof and red doors at the midpoint of the bottom of the mural. The mural installation is underway.\n\n![artwork murals for West Falls](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-West-Falls-murals.jpg)\n\n### **City-initiated public artwork**\n\n![utility box artwork at Falls Church city hall.](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-City-Hall-utility-box-art-reduced.jpg)Utility box art near City Hall\n\nBefore the COVID pandemic, the AHC implemented one “art wrapped”utility box as public art at the intersection of Park Avenue and Little Falls Street (shown at right).  More recently, the City issued a call for proposals to artists for artwork for four more utility boxes in Falls Church. The winning artists will each receive $1,250 for their designs, and the City will own the rights to their work. The City will install the selected designs as vinyl (or similar) wraps on the utility boxes.\n\nThe winning entries are shown below, with a picture of the utility box and location for each artwork. Each piece will include QR codes for information from the artist about the work. Staff hope the artwork will be installed by the end of summer.\n\n![Utility box artwork](https://fallschurchpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/Arts-utility-box-art-combined.jpg)\n\n### **Portraits for City Council chambers**\n\nThe City also plans to diversify the art in City Council chambers. Currently, portraits of four Founding Fathers donated by the Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS) decorate the chamber walls. A request for quotations (RFQ) released in May 2024, seeks to add two more pieces of art to this central meeting space.\n\nThe RFQ provides suggestions of people, places, or events that artists may want to incorporate, such as:\n\n**People:** Frederick Forrest Foote Jr., Barb Cram, Mary Riley Styles, Edwin B. and Mary Ellen Henderson, Joseph Tinner, and Harriet Brice.\n\n**Places:** The Falls Church, Cherry Hill Farmhouse and Barn, the Eden Center, the Tinner Hill Arch, the Farmers’ Market, the W&OD Trail and Bridge, Brown’s Hardware.\n\n**Stories:** History of the land (indigenous through present day); the influence of women, Black and African Americans, and Vietnamese and Asian Americans in the City; and the formation of the Falls Church City Public School District.\n\nPreference will be given to proposals that expand recognition of all City of Falls Church history and stories not already depicted in the City’s public art. Electronic submissions are due June 14, 2024, by 5:00 pm.\n\n#### **References:**\n\n- [Planning Commission meeting, December 6,2023](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/player/clip/2504?view_id=2&meta_id=128023&redirect=true).

# In Falls Church
# CBC Wins Over Independents

By DOROTHY HERTZ  
SUN Correspondent

FALLS CHURCH - In a convincing victory, the non-partisan Citizens for a Better City (CBC) yesterday won control of the City Council for four years with the election of its four-man slate to the Council.

Mayor Charles M. Hailey led the CBC ticket with 937 votes. Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones ran second with 906 votes. Incumbent councilman Samuel J. Dennis polled 858 and incumbent Harold Silverstein, 823.

IN A NECK-AND-NECK race, former city attorney LaRue Van Meter won the job of city attorney over assistant city attorney G. William Hammer with 763 votes to Hammer's 686. It was Van Meter's fourth try for the job. He had been defeated in the last three city elections for the post.

Losing candidates in the Council race were "independents" Archie Munson, with 646 votes; Lewis P. Jones with 642; Francis Trapp, 608, and E. Don Rockey, 585.

Total vote cast was 1,528 of the city's 3,000 registered votes.

The CBC ticket established an early lead in all four wards and never ran behind. The CBC slate ran on its two-year record of "good government", continuing improvement of the school system, qualified appointments to boards and commissions and open discussion of public business.

The fiscally conservative "independents" charged the CBC with "bossism" and "free spending" during the campaign.

ORGANIZED TWO YEARS ago, the CBC broke up a controlling Council majority in 1959 with the election of a three-man slate. Through appointments it has gained a 6 to 1 majority on the Council. With yesterday's election it will control all seven Council seats when the Council is reorganized in September.

Hailey, 52, a Falls Church real estate broker, has been mayor since 1959 and was elected to a four-year Council term in 1957. He was the 1959 president of the Northern Virginia Real Estate Board. A new member of the CBC, he has joined with three CBC councilman on major issues in the last two years.

Dennis, a statistician with the Bureau of the Census, was appointed to the Council in March to fill the vacancy left by Charles Kellogg, who resigned. Dennis was a City Council member in 1948-49 and served on the town council and town planning commission from 1945 to 1948. One of the founders of the CBC, he is a past president of the George Mason PTA.

Jones, 45, has been a member of the Falls Church Planning Commission for seven years and its chairman since 1957. He is Chief of the Technical Library at Engineer Research and Development Laboratories at Fort Belvoir. He was an early member of the CBC.

Silverstein, 43, special assistant to the chief signal officer, Department of Defense, was appointed to the Council in January to fill a vacancy left by former mayor, Thomas A. O'Halloran.

One of the founders of the CBC, he is past president of the North Greenway Downs Citizens Association and past president of the Thomas Jefferson PTA.

The three other CBC Council members, elected two years ago, are Vice Mayor Lee M. Rhoads and Councilmen Charles Hedetniemi and Everett Johnston.

# Stephens, Harrison Split On Prince Edward School Plan

Lt. Gov. A. E. S. Stephens and former Atty. Gen. Albertis S. Harrison expressed totally different views yesterday on whether or not the state could reopen Negro schools abandoned two years ago in the face of court-ordered desegregation.

White students in Prince Edward have attended private schools under a "freedom of choice" tuition grant setup since public schools were closed in 1959. But Negroes have refused grants and have had little or no formal education.

THE ISSUE was considered almost certain to be brought up again tonight when the candidates debate for the second time in Norfolk. They debated once before in the campaign at Richmond.

Stephens said in Martinsville yesterday "the legislature could authorize reopening of schools in Prince Edward County and you would still have your 'freedom of choice' to deal with school desegregation."

Harrison, at a press club luncheon in Richmond, said "the state is completely without statutory authority to operate schools in the county."

Stephens said students who did not wish to attend integrated schools could "accept a grant and go to a private school." "We must not deny one single child in Virginia the right to a free public school education," he said.

HARRISON said there was "no such thing as opening a 'Negro school' in Prince Edward... and this Mr. Stephens knows.

"For the state to go into Prince Edward County to operate schools with state funds would be a completely revolutionary change in Virginia.

"Take over a locality's public school system... other localities would want the state to assume the same financial burden."

State Sen. Armistead L. Boothe, Stephens' running mate for lieutenant governor, was the first of the candidates to mention reopening of schools for Prince Edward Negroes.

Hardly had Stephens lent support to the suggestion when state Sen. Bill Stone, a Harrison supporter, entered the dispute.

Stone issued a statement saying: "I now call on 'GI' Stephens to withdraw as a candidate... he is only a captive candidate who takes orders from 'Army' Boothe... Boothe now sets policy without consulting Stephens."

Stephens had a prepared speech to deliver at Martinsville later in the night, but discarded the text to answer Stone's charge. "There is not, a scintilla of truth in what has been uttered," he said.

HE CALLED Stone "one who would attack unjustifiably and falsely to carry out a point." T. Munford Boyd, candidate on the Stephens' ticket for attorney general, said he was "greatly impressed" by Stone's statement.

"It leaves no 'Stone' unturned," he said. "But gentlemen, there's a 'Stone' I'd like to turn... I'd like to turn him over my knee and spank him, and I'm old enough to do it. He's behaving like a spoiled brat rather than like the dignified state senator which his office suggests he should be."

# Biracial Athletics Expected
# Board Approval Seen in Arlington

ARLINGTON - The chairman of the Arlington County School board indicated today that interscholastic athletics will be integrated in the county school system this fall.

Mrs. Elizabeth Campbell said that while no formal action has been taken, some Negroes are trying out for Arlington athletic teams and she is certain they will be allowed to compete.

The right of Negroes to compete in Arlington's integrated system is now pending in a suit before a federal court. The board was informed yesterday it will be some weeks before the matter is legally decided.

Mrs. Campbell said the question will be placed on the agenda of a September meeting for official action. She said no opposition is expected from any of the board members.

Although Arlington schools have been desegregated since 1959, Negroes have never been allowed to compete in athletic contests between county schools. Last spring the board eased its policy concerning integrated athletics to allow Negroes from other jurisdictions to compete against Arlington schools. This happened as a result of action by Fairfax County when it withdrew its integrated track team from a regional meet held here.

Arlington will not be the first to integrate athletics, Mrs. Campbell said. Integrated competition is already allowed in Norfolk as well as Fairfax.

## Research Notes

This article provides significant insights into the process of school integration in Northern Virginia:

1. **Incremental integration process**: The article illustrates how integration happened in stages - Arlington had integrated classrooms since 1959, but athletic programs remained segregated until 1961, showing that full integration was a gradual process with different aspects of school life being integrated at different times.

2. **Comparative regional progress**: While Arlington led the way in classroom integration (1959), they lagged behind Fairfax County in athletic integration. This reveals the complex and uneven nature of desegregation across Northern Virginia jurisdictions.

3. **External pressure as catalyst**: Arlington's movement toward athletic integration was accelerated by Fairfax County's decision to withdraw its integrated track team from a meet in Arlington - demonstrating how jurisdictions influenced each other and how integration often required external pressure.

4. **Legal backdrop**: The pending federal court case about athletic integration shows how legal processes continued to shape integration efforts even after initial classroom desegregation had begun.

5. **Strategic timing**: Published in late August 1961, this article appeared just as the 1961-62 school year was about to start, which would be the first school year with integrated classrooms in Falls Church (based on earlier reports from April-June 1961).

This article helps establish a more complete timeline of desegregation in Northern Virginia:
- Arlington integrated classrooms in 1959
- Fairfax integrated athletics before Arlington (by spring 1961)
- Falls Church was preparing for its first integrated classroom experience in fall 1961
- Athletic integration lagged behind classroom integration by approximately 2-3 years

# Candidates Argue Whisper Charges In Falls Church

FALLS CHURCH – The Falls Church council campaign, which has been touted as the quietest in years, has been reduced to a whisper.

At least whispers are what door-to-door canvassers of Candidates for a Better City (CBC) have told the candidates they uncovered during their work to drum up votes.

AND THE reported whispers have provoked a sharp retort from Mayor Charles M. Hailey on behalf of his CBC running-mates—Councilmen Samuel Dennis and Harold Silverstein, and Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones.

And they drew an equally sharp disclaimer from the four men opposing the CBC slate in today's election for four council seats—Lewis P. Jones, Archie T. Munson, E. Don Rockey Sr., and Francis W. Trapp.

Hailey said the whispers go like this: that upon election, the CBC candidates would fire Harry Wells, city clerk, and Don Frady, director of public works.

"These are last-minute desperation tactics in which city employees are being used as pawns" (in the campaign). He said the two men were held in "high regard" by the CBC for their "outstanding" contributions to the community.

"We call upon all candidates to repudiate this talk. We vigorously deny these unwarranted charges and protest such insinuations," the mayor's statement said.

THE FOUR candidates opposing the CBC slate likewise denied knowing anything about the rumors, and lashed at any insinuations the independents were behind them.

Lewis P. Jones said, in answer to the mayor's statement: "That (the rumor) sounds most ridiculous. It sounds like something the CBC dreamed up" as a campaign issue.

Munson termed the mayor's rumor report "like name-calling. They run out of arguments and call names to put you on the defensive."

Trapp said that "from time to time I've heard rumors, but I haven't given them any credence. We certainly haven't circulated them."

ROCKEY said he knew nothing at all about any rumors of firings. He added, however, that if proposed changes in the city charter are approved, any city council would have "autocratic power" to do anything it wanted to.

Two proposed changes will be on the ballot Tuesday:

To change the city attorney's post from an elective to an appointive one.

To eliminate a provision which now requires, on bond referenda, majority of both freeholders (property owners) and the total vote. The change would require a simple majority of all voters, without distinguishing between them.

Two candidates are also in the running for city attorney, a post for which City Attorney Philip Brophy is not running. The candidates are LaRue VanMeter and G. William Hammer.

# Boothe's Plan Gets Brushoff

RICHMOND (AP) - A suggestion by State Sen. Armistead L. Boothe of Alexandria aimed at reopening the closed public schools of Prince Edward County has drawn a discreet sidestep by Gov. J. Lindsay Almond Jr.

Almond said yesterday that in view of the "critical state of litigation" in the Prince Edward case, he considered "it the better part of wisdom to refrain from comment."

Boothe's proposal would make available to the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors some $330,000 in funds already appropriated for the county schools in the current biennium which have not been used up.

IN A LETTER he wrote Boothe, Almond said, "I do not wish to do or say anything which would occasion embarrassment to the courts, state or federal, or to counsel of record." The governor said "I am sure you are aware that legal complications are involved at the executive level. These circumstances would seem to indicate care and caution on my part."

Boothe said adoption of his plan "would obviate any further effect of the most recent federal court decree" Federal Judge Oren R. Lewis' ruling that the county cannot use tuition grants or tax credits to finance private segregated schools as long as the public schools remain closed.

ACCORDING to Boothe, public schools would be open to the Negroes and the private schools would remain for the white children. Negroes have had no formal education since Prince Edward closed its public schools in 1959 to avoid court-ordered desegregation. White students have attended private schools financed mainly until this year by the tuition grants and tax credits. Negroes have rejected such a school system.

# Almond, Byrd Set For Rally

Virginia's two top politicians and government leaders Gov. J. Lindsay Almond and Sen. Harry F. Byrd will attend a political rally Monday night in Arlington.

The two men—whose relations have been strained since Gov. Almond scrapped Byrd's "massive resistance" to integration—will speak at a gathering at the home of H. Bruce Green, Arlington Clerk of Court.

Principal speaker at the event, scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. at 1107 N. Barton St., will be Albertis S. Harrison, who won the Democratic nomination for Governor in the July primary.

Sen. Byrd will deliver the welcoming speech and Gov. Almond will introduce Harrison. The public is invited.

The event is a traditional one started 36 years ago by Green's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Harry K. Green, and continued by them for the purpose of kicking off the gubernatorial campaign in Northern Virginia every four years.

Green's father died a decade ago but his widow, known affectionately to thousands as "Ma" Green, carried on the tradition. Mrs. Green died last year and her son, Bruce, announced last week he would carry on the tradition.

More than 1,000 persons are expected to attend the event.

# In Falls Church  
# Charter Vote Is Urged  

FALLS CHURCH – A seven-member charter review committee has recommended a referendum in the June 13 city election to determine whether two major changes should be made in the city charter.  

In an initial report to the City Council last night, the charter committee suggested that the controversial question of whether the city attorney should be elected or appointed be taken to the voters because of a "difference of opinion in the city" on the issue.  

**THE POST** formerly an appointive one, became elective through a 1951 referendum during a local political fight.  

In another change, the charter revision committee proposed removal of a controversial provision that requires a majority of freeholders (property owners) to approve any bond issue. The report recommends that this proposal also be submitted to referendum in June.  

A $1.2 million bond issue approved by a slim majority of freeholders last November is being challenged in Fairfax Circuit Court on grounds that some freeholders were not allowed to vote as property owners because of errors in the voting list.  

**THE REVISION** also would eliminate a required 5-vote council majority in adoption of bond ordinances. In 1957 a minority of the council was able to block a proposed school bond referendum because of the five vote provision.  

The report calls for public hearings in the fall to air six minor changes recommended by the committee.  

The proposal would:  

- Delete a description of detailed boundaries of the city.
- Specify that the city charter take precedence over general state law.
- Clarify duties of the city clerk.
- Set forth three methods of amending the charter – by voters' petition to the council, by referendum, or by resolution of a majority of the council. The provision conforms to the state law.
- Delete a provision calling for submission of work plans by city departments to the city manager.
- Eliminate a provision requiring ordinances for capital projects. The revision also would clarify procedures for five-year capital programs.  

Committee chairman Lee M. Rhoads said the charter review group will continue its study of the 10-year-old city charter and compile other reports.

# May Face VEA Action
# Arlington Teacher Group Integrates

By HELEN DEWAR  
SUN Staff Writer

ARLINGTON – Virginia Education Association directors are expected to grapple next month with the question of whether to expel its Arlington affiliate – the first local teachers association in the state to approve admission of Negroes to its membership.

Sources hesitate to predict the eventual outcome of this controversy, but are hoping the VEA board of directors will decline to recommend expulsion, an action never before taken against a local affiliate.

VOTES tallied yesterday showed that, despite veiled threats of expulsion by the VEA, Arlington's white teachers had approved by a 56-vote margin the proposed merger of the white and Negro teachers associations in the county.

With 90 per cent of the 1,100-member Arlington Education Association voting, 519 ballots were cast in favor of admitting Negro teachers and 463 ballots were cast against the action.

The 84-member Negro Arlington Teachers Association voted earlier to support the principle of a desegregated teachers unit.

AEA EXECUTIVE Secretary Richard Neal said the close vote resulted more from a fear of VEA expulsion than it did from a reluctance to admit Negro teachers.

"I just can't believe there are 463 teachers who believe that Negro teachers shouldn't be a part of the Arlington Education Association," he said.

Neal said AEA President Sim Taylor will write the VEA informing it officially of the Arlington action. "What will happen at that point no one can say," he added.

The executive secretary of the VEA, Robert F. Williams, said he has "no idea what the board will do because this has never happened before."

He noted, however, that the VEA's statewide drama section was expelled some time ago for admitting Negro members.

While there is no provision in the VEA constitution or bylaws against admitting Negro teachers, Williams said, it had been felt there was no need for such a provision.

DURING the balloting, some argued that there had been indications from Richmond that any desegregated local group would be expelled. Others, pointing to the state's "freedom of choice" program and the VEA's announced policy of conforming to general state practices on integration, argued that the VEA would allow Arlington to pursue its own desired course.

One VEA official speculated that, if the board of directors declined to recommend expulsion, the VEA general assembly next fall would allow Arlington to remain in the group. In any event, he added, the issue is almost certain to arise at the October assembly session.

# 'Independents' Hit

To The Editor:

The real issue is whether Falls Church will continue to have a government that provides an environment which nurtures a healthy, dynamic school system, a well planned community, sound public relations—or allow medieval government to return? All other issues, false or otherwise, are really insignificant in comparison.

By supporting the self-styled "Independent" candidates, the same backward-looking group which the aroused voters relieved of control in the 1959 election is now trying to regain control and return Falls Church to the unhappy past. The 1959 fires of righteous indignation must be rekindled if Falls Church is ever to stop swinging round and round in a vicious circle, with apathy and indignant frustration alternating in the middle.

CBC Candidate for  
The Falls Church City Council

## Research Notes

This letter to the editor from Thomas R. Jones, who was running as a CBC candidate, provides a remarkable glimpse into how the Citizens for a Better City framed the June 1961 election - and by extension, Falls Church's approach to integration and modernization:

1. **Educational focus**: Jones frames "a healthy, dynamic school system" as the first priority of the CBC, placing education at the center of the political divide. This suggests that the CBC's approach to school integration was a core part of their identity and political platform. By emphasizing education first, the CBC aligned itself with the progressive movement to improve and integrate schools.

2. **Ideological framing**: The language is stark and ideological - describing the independents' vision as "medieval government" versus CBC's "well planned community." This portrays the election as a binary choice between progress and regression, modernity and antiquity. Such framing was designed to portray opponents of the CBC as not just wrong on policy but fundamentally backward-looking.

3. **Historical narrative**: Jones explicitly references the 1959 election when the CBC first gained power, describing it as when "aroused voters relieved of control" a "backward-looking group." This demonstrates how the CBC viewed itself as rescuing Falls Church from an antiquated leadership, and it establishes a narrative of continuing reform that began in 1959.

4. **Emotional appeal**: The reference to "fires of righteous indignation" suggests that the 1959 election was driven by moral outrage at the previous administration's policies, likely including their resistance to integration and school improvements. By calling for these "fires" to be "rekindled," Jones frames opposition to the independents as a moral imperative.

5. **The stakes**: By characterizing a potential return to the old leadership as returning to "the unhappy past," Jones paints a picture of Falls Church before CBC control as dysfunctional or failing its citizens. This framing elevates the election beyond ordinary politics to a referendum on the city's identity and future.

This letter effectively frames the June 1961 election as a referendum on Falls Church's future direction, particularly regarding education and integration. The author (who would go on to win election the next day) positions the CBC as the forward-thinking group that would continue modernizing Falls Church, while portraying the independents as representing regression to segregation-era policies.

The timing is particularly significant - published during the same period when the school board was reviewing its first integration applications, this letter helps connect the political transformation of Falls Church with its approach to civil rights and integration. It suggests that for the CBC, educational progress and racial integration were inseparable parts of their broader vision for Falls Church's future.

# Inside Falls Church

# City's Political Pot Is Perking

By DOROTHY HERTZ  
SUN Staff Writer

Politics is becoming the consuming topic of interest in Falls Church as the filing deadline (April 14) for the June 13 city election nears.

Seven candidates have filed for the four City Council seats that will be up for election. A petition is being circulated on behalf of Planning Commission member E. Don Rockey, who is expected to announce shortly as an eighth candidate.

THREE independent candidates for the council — Francis Trapp, Archie Munson and Lewis P. Jones — will campaign against a four-man Citizens for a Better City slate which includes Mayor Charles Hailey, Councilman Harold Silverstein, Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones and former councilman Sam Dennis. Rockey is expected to follow suit as an independent candidate.

Speculation is that the campaign will be a typically hard-hitting one, revolving around an impending tax increase and the perennial issue of how much money the city should spend on its schools.

THE INDEPENDENT candidates are considered far more fiscally-conservative than the CBC, which was born two years ago primarily to push for better schools and specifically for a school bond referendum which had been rejected by the City Council in 1957 and 1958. The CBC won three Council seats in its first political endeavor in 1959 with the election of Charles Redfetierni, Everett Johnston and Lee M. Rhoads to four-year terms. CBC gained a five-man Council majority with the appointment of Silverstein to Thomas O'Halloran's unexpired term and with the membership of Mayor Hailey.

Independent candidate Trapp was a founder and president of the Falls Church Taxpayers League which was formed last fall for the purpose of defeating the long-delayed bond issue. Following passage of the $1.2 million bond issue in November, the Taxpayers League contested the election. The suit is still pending in Fairfax Circuit Court.

Falls Church's annexation suit for 4.5 square miles of surrounding Fairfax County territory is not contemplated as a campaign issue, since the court and council decisions probably will be concluded before a new council takes office in September.

TWO CANDIDATES are in the race as independent for City Attorney — LaRue VanMeter, who was town and city attorney from 1945 to 1951 and William Hammer, who has been assistant city attorney since 1959.

There is considerable guessing about whether the five CBC councilmen on Monday will name one of the four CBC Council candidates to fill the unexpired term of Charles Kellogg. The term, one of the four up for election in June, ends August 31. Other seats up for election are held by incumbents Hailey and Silverstein and Charles Seymour, who has given no indication that he will seek re-election.

SURPRISING MISCELLANY: All the adjacent residents to the Risemman tract on W. Broad Street are in favor of a proposed luxury apartment on the property, a project contingent upon a rezoning coming up for City Council action. The Westbrook Gardens apartment project back of the Risemman property went before the Planning Commission and or City Council 33 times over a period of several years before it was approved.

# Fairfax's Dismissal Plea Filed

By HANK BURCHARD  
SUN Staff Writer

FAIRFAX —A Fairfax County motion for dismissal of Falls Church's suit to annex 4.5 square miles of county land was passed over by the special three-judge annexation court yesterday. Circuit Court Judge Arthur W. Sinclair of Fairfax, acting as spokesman for the court, said the bench "prefers to delay ruling on the motion" until both sides have been heard.

FALLS Church yesterday completed its six-day presentation of testimony purporting to show that annexation of the territory sought "is necessary and expedient," would not "permanently injure the county," and "would greatly benefit the people in the annexable area by giving them urban government and services."

Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney Robert C. Fitzgerald's motion to dismiss the suit, on the grounds that Falls Church which as plaintiff bears the burden of proof has not built a case, was expected. The County's defense, which started late yesterday, is expected to take about two weeks.

The court refusal to act immediately on the motion was apparently designed to strengthen the decision in the higher courts to which the case will certainly be appealed no matter which side wins.

In making his dismissal motion yesterday, Fitzgerald asserted Falls Church witnesses "have given this court many opinions, but they have not been backed up by acts."

"(FALLS Church planning consultant Julian) Tarrant, the city's one witness, told this court the Seven Corners Shopping Center has no community of interest with Falls Church and would not be affected if the city disappeared."

"On the other hand, he admitted the city could not afford to annex the western areas it seeks unless it took Seven Corners on the east to pay for it."

"The city says it can provide urban-type services to the annexable area which the county cannot. Yet in almost the same breath the city's witnesses admit they provide only one service—water—to the area, and make a tidy profit on that. The court will also note that the city says their water company is considered to be, and is taxed as, a private business."

"Falls Church has no hospital. It has no parks. Its police force would not serve even to police Seven Corners alone. Its fire department was set up and is regulated by the county. We help train the city police."

"THEY have no jail, no colored school, no program for health and welfare services for the area."

"It is plain that the city has gerrymandered the proposed annexation boundary to include that which is a tax-rich plum and exclude that which is a tax liability," Fitzgerald said.

Falls Church attorney Robert McCandlish rebutted that the city is prepared to spend $77,600 to establish police protection for the area, $10,000 for street cleaning, and more than $100,000 for street repairs and lights. "The boundary line is proper and we have shown substantial evidence that it is," McCandlish said.

"The statute doesn't require that annexation be in the best interests of the area annexed," he said.

"The county would recover the loss in population and revenues within a year," he asserted.

"NECESSITY for annexation has been shown by Tarrant's testimony that only 129 vacant acres will be left in the city when the building permits outstanding are discharged."

"Whereas it might appear at first blush that Seven Corners is a tax-rich plum, we will show it isn't," McCandlish said.

The Falls Church attorney was referring to a late exhibit entered by the city which shows that the tax return from Seven Corners and adjacent areas dropped nearly $19,000 from 1960 to 1961.

Associate Fairfax counsel Frank L. Ball Sr. rose to add that "the city has not presented a single witness to endorse the plan who is not paid by Falls Church."

"The county has entered a petition by 23,178 residents outside the area who oppose the annexation, and 2,177 in the annexation area have come to join with Fairfax as intervenors in the suit."

"The city started a community of interest survey, but something happened to it—it was never made public or shown to this court."

"I know what happened to it and why it wasn't brought here, or wasn't finished."

"It showed that there is no significant community of interest between the people in the annexation area and the city. Those people don't want to become part of Falls Church."

# 'Resistance' Still in Saddle?

To The Editor:

One wonders how the recent claims of the Harrison-Godwin ticket to love, honor, and protect the public school system of Virginia jibe with the most recent appointment of Ruth Bauserman to manage their new Arlington headquarters. Harrison's running mate Godwin in Richmond and "our" Mrs. Bauserman in Arlington fought "long and loud" for a policy which would, in effect, have closed our schools. Can it be that the old "massive resistance" mentality still sits firmly in the saddle, if one bets on the Harrison horse?

On Dec. 4, 1958, during those dark days of doubt and fear when schools in Charlottesville and Norfolk had already succumbed to hysteria and had closed their doors, Mary Marshall submitted a resolution to the Arlington Democratic Committee urging that "all honorable and legal means" for keeping the schools open be pursued in Arlington.

The realistic, thoughtful majority of that committee gave the resolution its overwhelming support. Only six members, in fact, expressed themselves against it, including the woman who has now been selected to mother-hen the local offices of the Harrison-Godwin-Button ticket.

One can conclude only that Harrison finds rather slim pickings among his supporters in Arlington or that Mrs. Bauserman and massive resistance represent the true but antiquated sentiments of the Harrison-Godwin-Button ticket, all recent pronouncements to the contrary.

## Research Notes

This letter provides valuable insights into the broader state-level political context surrounding school integration in Northern Virginia:

1. **Massive Resistance legacy**: The letter demonstrates how "massive resistance" remained a divisive political issue in Virginia in 1961, with the writer questioning if the Harrison-Godwin gubernatorial ticket still secretly harbored pro-segregation views despite their public statements. This reveals the lingering tensions even as official policies were beginning to change.

2. **Arlington's progressive stance**: The letter specifically mentions that Arlington had taken steps to avoid school closures, contrasting with Charlottesville and Norfolk which had "succumbed to hysteria" - highlighting Arlington's more progressive approach. This aligns with other evidence showing Arlington leading integration efforts in Northern Virginia.

3. **Regional variation**: The letter implicitly compares Arlington's approach with other parts of Virginia, showing the political differences between Northern Virginia and other regions regarding integration. This reinforces the pattern of Northern Virginia jurisdictions moving more quickly toward integration than other parts of the state.

4. **1958 crisis point**: References the "dark days of doubt and fear" in December 1958 establish a timeline of when Virginia's massive resistance policies reached their peak, leading to actual school closures in some jurisdictions. This provides crucial context for understanding the evolution of integration policies.

5. **Political evolution**: The writer suggests that the Harrison campaign was trying to present a more moderate image on school integration while still employing people who had previously supported closing schools rather than integrating. This highlights the political transition occurring in Virginia as open resistance became less tenable.

This letter, when read alongside other election-related content from June 1961, reveals how school integration remained a central political issue in Virginia during the gubernatorial campaign, which was occurring simultaneously with Falls Church's local election and the beginning of school integration efforts in that city.

The document shows that even as Falls Church was moving forward with integration under CBC leadership, the statewide political landscape remained divided, with the Harrison-Godwin ticket (who would eventually win) attempting to navigate the political transition away from "massive resistance" while still appealing to its former supporters.

# 83 Negro Pupils Seek Transfers

Some 83 Negro students have applied for transfers to predominantly white schools in Fairfax county, county pupil placement officer George Pope reported today. Today is the deadline for public school students to apply for school transfers in Arlington and Falls Church, which have adopted local pupil assignment plans, and in Fairfax, where county supervisors were expected to approve an emergency local assignment plan at their today's session. 

POPE SAID that he had received "quite a stack" of transfer applications from Negro students, including 63 applications filed by Alexandria Negro attorney Otto Tucker acting in behalf of a group of students seeking transfers. An additional 20 applications had come in from individual Negro students, Pope estimated. 

Pope said that a report on which schools the Negro students wish to attend probably would be withheld until next week, to allow time for processing the applications. 

TWO NEGRO children have applied for entrance into white schools of Falls Church - a six-year-old boy who wishes to enroll in James Madison Elementary's first grade and a 12-year-old girl seeking a transfer to the 10th grade of George Mason High School. Falls Church, which has never operated a Negro school, has sent Negro pupils to Fairfax county schools in the past under a long-standing agreement with the county.

In Arlington, no figures were available on the yet-unprocessed applications for school transfers. County pupil placement officer Howard Boyce has estimated that some 30 transfer applications are awaiting processing, including applications from both Negro and white students.

The April 5 deadline for transfer requests is written into the General Assembly's "freedom of choice" school legislation, which gives localities the option of making their own school assignments. Transfer applications for Alexandria schools will continue to be processed by the State Pupil Placement Board, in Richmond.

# Schmitt to Handle Pupil Placements

FALLS CHURCH - The school board last night designated Supt. Irvin H. Schmitt as its agent to make all initial placements of Falls Church school pupils, including two Negro children who have applied for admission to the city's all-white school system. 

Schmitt said that before making a decision on placement of the two Negro children he will review their applications. A six-year-old Negro boy is seeking placement in the first grade of the city's Madison Elementary School and a 15-year-old Negro girl has asked to be placed in the 10th grade of George Mason High School. 

Schmitt indicated the applications would be approved, saying "They have to be accepted unless there is some reason (in the pupil placement law) for not accepting them." Schmitt was uncertain whether action would be taken on the applications this week.

OVER THE objections of School Board Member H. P. Strople the board decided not to enter into placement matters unless appeals are made to the board by parents. Strople favored deferring action on placement of the two Negro pupils until Supt. Schmitt submitted his recommendations to the board. Strople said that if the pupils are rejected "you won't get an appeal from parents it will go right into court. The school board, not the superintendent, is subject to suit," he said.

The applications mark the first time Negroes have applied for admission to Falls Church schools. Falls Church has no Negro schools in its system. Under a 12-year-old agreement with Fairfax County, Falls Church pays the county full tuition costs for educating the city's 32 Negro students in county schools. The city's Negro pupils traditionally have applied voluntarily to Fairfax County schools. 

About 20 persons attended last night's board meeting. Supt. Schmitt said he has not had any reaction from parents over the probability of integration in two of the city's four schools.

# 100 Negroes to Go To White Schools

ARLINGTON — About 100 Negro children automatically will be assigned to predominantly white schools under the Arlington School Board's local placement plan.

These children, who live in the attendance areas of white schools, are among about 120 Negroes to request transfer to new schools, according to Pupil Placement Officer Howard Boyce.

FINAL figures on the number of transfer applications are not yet available, Boyce said. He estimated that an exact count would be made by Tuesday or Wednesday.

The latest Arlington estimate brings to more than 200 the total number of Negro children who have applied for white and desegregated schools in Northern Virginia. About 80 Negroes have applied in Fairfax, and three in Falls Church, where schools are still segregated.

Boyce said that about 175 transfer applications have been received from Negro and white pupils. About 50 of the applications come from white pupils seeking transfer to new white schools.

ABOUT 20 of the Negro transfer applications were made by pupils residing in the Hoffman-Boston (Negro) school area, and because of the geographic criterion they will be denied transfer to the school for which they requested transfer, Boyce said.

Under Arlington's recently adopted placement plan, Negro children living in attendance areas of white schools are given a choice of attending the school in their area or the Negro school they previously attended. School officials earlier estimated that about 150 were eligible for transfer under this rule.

Boyce said that two more white schools would be desegregated under this plan — Gunston and Swanson junior high schools.

Of the approximately 100 eligible transfers, 30 will be admitted to Swanson, 20 to Stratford Junior High, 20 to Patrick Henry Elementary, 13 to Washington-Lee Senior High, 12 to Thomas Jefferson Junior High, and 4 to Gunston, Boyce said.

Forty Negro children now are attending six previously all-white schools under federal court order. This is the first time that Arlington has admitted Negro pupils to white schools without court orders.

For the past five years, all pupil assignments were made by the State Pupil placement Board. But under Virginia's "freedom of choice" program and under rules established recently by the State Board of Education, localities were again permitted to handle their own assignments if they chose to do so.

Alexandria is the only Northern Virginia locality still having its assignments made by the State Placement Board.

Northern Virginia desegregation applications probably will total more than 130, sources indicated today. Deadline for transfer applications under local pupil assignment plans was yesterday, but Arlington and Fairfax officials have yet to make an official tally of the number of Negroes seeking transfer to white schools.

However, this was the picture as of this morning:

• In Fairfax County, 63 applications have been filed by Negro attorney Otto L. Tucker and another 20 or so have come in from individual Negro pupils, according to Assistant Supt. George Pope.

• In Arlington, approximately 50 Negroes are applying for white schools, a source outside the school system estimated. Arlington School Supt. Ray E. Reid.

# Group Has 5-1 Edge As Result
# Dennis Named to Falls Church Council

FALLS CHURCH – Samuel C. Dennis, a former councilman who is a candidate for the Citizens for a Better City for council in the June city election, last night was named to the unexpired council term of Charles Kellogg who resigned.

The term ends Aug. 31. Dennis, who received the highest number of votes as a write-in candidate at the CBC nominating convention in March, was appointed to the council post last night on a second ballot with five of six council votes.

COUNCILMAN Charles Seymour supported Archie Monson for the post. In the initial balloting, Dennis got three votes, with Councilman Everett Johnston supporting Claud Wells, and Councilman Harold Silverstein voting for Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones. Johnston and Silverstein switched their votes to Dennis.

Others recommended for the vacancy were Planning Commission member E. John Rockey and Falls Church Taxpayer League president Francis Trapp, both independent candidates for the council.

The appointment of Dennis gives the CBC six members on the council.

Seymour, who announced he is not planning to run for re-election because of the pressure of business, lambasted the appointment of Dennis. In an obvious reference to the CBC, Seymour said "Falls Church is entering into a controlled political machine – an Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy type of politics. It was cut and dried as to who was going to be appointed," he said.

SILVERSTEIN called Seymour's comments "unfounded and confused." Dennis later was sworn in as councilman and took part in the meeting.

A statistician with the Bureau of the Census, Dennis was a member of the council from 1948 to 1953.
