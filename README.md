Vex is a product landing page theme/template created by [Themefisher] based on the latest [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
It is fully responsive and beautifully crafted with Product Showcase, Testimonials and Email Subscription sections.
See https://themefisher.com/products/vex-bootstrap4-product-landing-page-website-template/ for more information.

And now, the Vex theme has been ported to [Hugo], and made freely available to all!

```
  $ hugo new site <SITENAME>
