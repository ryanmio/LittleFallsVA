Vex is a product landing page theme/template created by [Themefisher] based on the latest [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
It is fully responsive and beautifully crafted with Product Showcase, Testimonials and Email Subscription sections.
See https://themefisher.com/products/vex-bootstrap4-product-landing-page-website-template/ for more information.

And now, Vex has been ported to [Hugo] thanks to the great work of Giacomo Mariani (@karjudev)!

## Usage
Create a new Hugo site by typing

```
  $ hugo new site <SITENAME>
```

Then clone this repository:
