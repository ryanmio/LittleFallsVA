# Civil War Reference to Union Pickets at Falls Church

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"Another Picket Murdered"â€”Fort Albany (Roache's), Alexandria County, July 26 (1861). "Editor of The Star: Yesterday afternoon a member of the New York regiment doing picket duty a mile this side of Falls Church was shot at Galpin's well for water. The spot is just where the 1st Connecticut Regiment was encamped previous to its march for Bull Run. He was shot from the woods nearby and received one ball in the abdomen that passed through his body and another through his arm. He was promptly brought down to this point and died at 4 o'clock this morning. His murderers were, of course, secession pickets or scouts concealed in the woods."

Another account of this case in The Star follows: "A picket of Company K. 24th New York Volunteers, named George W. Fox, was shot at his post, Baileys Cross Roads, about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. He had gone across the road to get a drink of water and a mounted trooper of the accessionists rode up and shot him through the arm and abdomen. He was brought to Fort Runyon, where he died this morning. The deceased was a native of Jefferson County, N. Y.; was a school teacher and volunteeres for the war."

[...]

"Men might be charged with the murder of United States pickets because Mosby's Partisan Rangers or White's Independent Cavalry attacked a Union picket post and some malevolent neighbor would tell the Union commander at Falls Church, Tysons Cross Roads or Lewinsville, that John Smith was one of Mosby's men."

## Historical Context

This 1861 account from The Star newspaper (later analyzed by John Harry Shannon) provides important historical context about Falls Church during the Civil War. The text establishes that:

1. Falls Church was a location of strategic military importance during the early Civil War period
2. Union forces maintained picket posts in and around Falls Church in July 1861, shortly after the First Battle of Bull Run
3. Falls Church had a Union military command post with sufficient authority to order arrests
4. The area was contested territory where Confederate forces (particularly irregular cavalry units) operated

The account describes the shooting of a Union picket near Falls Church, which occurred just days after the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run (July 21, 1861). This indicates that despite the Confederate victory at Bull Run, Union forces maintained a presence in Falls Church, suggesting its strategic importance along the approach to Washington DC.

## Significance for Falls Church History

This document provides several significant insights about Falls Church during the Civil War:

1. **Military Occupation**: Falls Church was occupied by Union forces in the earliest months of the Civil War, with Union regiments encamped in the vicinity

2. **Strategic Location**: The presence of Union pickets and a military command post indicates Falls Church's strategic importance on the approaches to Washington

3. **Contested Territory**: The account demonstrates that Falls Church was in contested territory where both Union and Confederate forces operated

4. **Civil Tensions**: The reference to "malevolent neighbors" informing on residents suspected of Confederate sympathies suggests the community experienced internal tensions and divided loyalties

5. **Regional Context**: The document places Falls Church within a network of nearby locations (Tysons Cross Roads, Lewinsville, Bailey's Cross Roads) that were also sites of military significance during the war

This account helps establish Falls Church's role in the early Civil War period and documents the military presence that would have significantly impacted the local community during this tumultuous time.
