# Rock Fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac

## Transcription

"The season for rock (striped bass) fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac is now fairly open. Sportsmen are daily catching there as many as 50 each of a morning or afternoon, weighing from 1 to 20 pounds each."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from The Star in July 1862 documents recreational fishing at Little Falls during the Civil War era. The mention of "rock" refers to striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a prized game fish native to the Atlantic coast and its tributaries. The substantial catches reported (up to 50 fish per angler per session, with some weighing up to 20 pounds) indicate that Little Falls was a productive fishing ground with healthy fish populations.

This notice appeared alongside other local news items and advertisements for entertainment venues in Washington DC, providing a glimpse of everyday civilian life continuing alongside the Civil War, which was then in its second year.
