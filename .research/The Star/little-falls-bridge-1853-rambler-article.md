# Little Falls Bridge and Early History of the Area

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"In the Fall of 1853 Little Falls bridge was being rebuilt. References in acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland and other papers show that where two spans of Chain bridge cross the river there was a ferry as early as 1750. Then a wood bridge was built. A road passed over the rocky flats now crossed by several spans of Chain bridge. The wood bridge was broken down by flood and ferry service was renewed until another wood bridge was built. There was a succession of short wood bridges and ferries and in the 40's (consult the Rambler index for the date), the Chain bridge was built. The narrow part of the river was spanned by a suspension bridge, the wood floor and rails being suspended on four chains instead of wire cables, which later came into use. The Chain bridge was wrecked by flood and the road from the north end of it across the flats was often under water. The short bridge and ferry systems alternated until the building of a wood bridge on stone piers from the canal to the south bank.

In the late 70's the stone piers were built higher and the iron superstructure you know was built. In former "rambles" on District bridges will be found much matter with the dates concerning early bridges and ferries preceding the Chain bridge the chain bridge itself and its successors, none of which was a chain bridge, but each of which was called. "the Chain bridge." The Rambler believes that the following advertisement in The Star during September, 1853, refers to the building of the first bridge from the canal to the Virginia shore:

"Wanted immediately at the Little Falls bridge three miles above Georgetown 25 good stone cutters. Wages $2.30, $2.40 and $2.50 per day. Also 25 good laborers, wages $1.25 per day. George Thom, Captain Topographical Engineers in charge of construction, Little Falls bridge.""

## Historical Context

This 1925 article by "The Rambler" (a historical columnist for The Star newspaper) discusses the history of bridges across the Potomac River at Little Falls, providing critically important historical information about the area that would become Falls Church. The article establishes several key historical facts:

1. The name "Little Falls" was in use for this area as early as 1750, when a ferry operated at this location
2. The Little Falls Bridge was a significant infrastructure project being rebuilt in 1853
3. The location was important enough to warrant federal engineering oversight (Captain George Thom of the Topographical Engineers)
4. The area had continuous historical significance as a crossing point between Virginia and Maryland/DC

The Rambler cites official government documents ("References in acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland") establishing the historical prominence of Little Falls as a geographical designation dating back to colonial times. The 1853 advertisement shows that "Little Falls bridge" was the official name used in government contracting at that time.

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This article provides several pieces of evidence that strongly support the historical significance of the "Little Falls" name:

1. **Colonial Era Usage**: The reference to a ferry at Little Falls "as early as 1750" establishes that this geographical designation predates the American Revolution and the establishment of the church that would later give its name to Falls Church.

2. **Official Government Recognition**: The name appears in official government acts from both Virginia and Maryland legislatures, demonstrating formal recognition of "Little Falls" as a geographical designation.

3. **Continuous Usage**: The article traces the continuous use of the "Little Falls" name through multiple infrastructure projects spanning more than a century (1750s-1870s).

4. **Federal Recognition**: The 1853 advertisement shows the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers officially using "Little Falls bridge" as the name for this important infrastructure project.

5. **Regional Significance**: The significant investment in bridge-building (with relatively high wages offered) demonstrates the economic and transportation importance of Little Falls as a crossing point between Virginia and the Georgetown/DC area.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This document provides perhaps the strongest historical evidence yet for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Pre-Revolutionary Origins**: The documented use of "Little Falls" dating to 1750 predates the establishment of both the United States and the Falls Church building, making it the area's original geographical designation.

2. **Official Historical Recognition**: The citation of legislative acts using this name provides official historical government recognition of "Little Falls" as the authentic name for this region.

3. **Continuous Historical Thread**: The article establishes an unbroken historical thread of the "Little Falls" name from colonial times through the Civil War era and beyond.

4. **Geographic Foundation**: Unlike the church-based name that came later, "Little Falls" describes the actual geographical feature that defined this area and made it significant - its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac River.

5. **Historical Infrastructure Connection**: The repeated construction of bridges at Little Falls demonstrates how this geographical feature shaped development patterns and transportation networks in Northern Virginia.

This historical account by The Rambler provides authoritative documentation that "Little Falls" was the original, long-standing geographical designation for this area, with roots stretching back to the colonial era. The renaming initiative's effort to restore this name thus represents a return to the area's authentic historical identity rather than the introduction of a new name.
