# Nelly: Real Person or Composite Figure?

**Historical Records:** Evidence suggests that *Nelly* was indeed a real enslaved person owned by Colonel James Wren in Falls Church, Virginia. James Wren's will (1815) explicitly names **"Nelly"** as one of the enslaved individuals bequeathed to his son, James Wren Jr. ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). In fact, Wren's will enumerated twenty enslaved people by name and allocated them among his wife and children, with Nelly listed (alongside "Kitty" and "Lilly") as already in the possession of his son James Jr. ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). This confirms that Nelly was not merely symbolic; she appears in a primary document of the period. 

**Additional Mentions:** Beyond the will, enslaved individuals generally do not appear by name in early 19th-century census or tax records, so Nelly does not surface in those sources. No church baptismal or marriage records for Nelly have been found in available archives. Thus, apart from Wren's estate documents, we have little personal detail about Nelly's life. Her presence in the historical record is essentially limited to that will, which means her individual story—family relations, eventual fate—remains largely unrecorded. Given this scarcity of detail, the *story* told about Nelly in modern narratives (such as the interactive "Nelly's Journey") is **composite in nature**, extrapolating from the common experiences of enslaved people in that time and place. In other words, Nelly was a real person, but the rich narrative of her life is a historical reconstruction representing what many enslaved women in Fairfax County/Falls Church likely endured. Her known existence lends authenticity, but specific events (family life, love, escape attempts, etc.) in such narratives are drawn from the broader context of slavery in the region rather than from specific records about Nelly herself.

**Conclusion on Identity:** In sum, Nelly *was* a real enslaved woman mentioned in Falls Church's historical records, but beyond that single mention her life is not documented. For historical storytelling purposes, she serves as a **representative figure** of the enslaved community. Researchers have not found further archival data (wills, church registers, or emancipation records) that detail Nelly's own experiences. Therefore, any detailed biography of Nelly relies on composite historical context – using what is known of James Wren's slaves and the era's typical conditions – to imagine her story. This approach ensures that while Nelly's name comes from the record, her narrative honors the **"countless others who have lived and died in bondage"**, to quote the user's narrative, whose individual stories went unrecorded ([_index.md](file://file-B83M9svcZJYp5XVLqtmj3n#:~:text=saw%20families%20torn%20apart%20by,p)).

# James Wren's Role as a Slaveholder

## Enslaved People Owned by Wren

**Number of Enslaved Individuals:** James Wren was a substantial slaveholder in Fairfax County. At the time of his death in November 1815, **he owned 20 enslaved persons** ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=)). This figure is corroborated by the probate records of his estate. His will (recorded in Fairfax County Will Book K, pp.363–367) lists all twenty by name and designates to whom each would go ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=These%20enslaved%20persons%20were%20named,1)) ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). The enslaved people included men, women, and children, some identified with skills (for example, a man named Charles is noted as a blacksmith) ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)). Wren's enslaved property was divided among his widow and six of his children. The presence of skilled laborers among them suggests Wren utilized their talents in his various enterprises.

**Reliance on Enslaved Labor:** Like other Virginia planters and gentry of his era, Wren's wealth and accomplishments were deeply tied to enslaved labor. He had acquired extensive land holdings in Fairfax and Loudoun counties during his life ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=posts%20including%20Fairfax%20Commissioner%20of,23)), and enslaved people almost certainly worked those farms (the user's narrative, for instance, envisions tobacco fields on the "Wren plantation" ([_index.md](file://file-B83M9svcZJYp5XVLqtmj3n#:~:text=,children%20ripped%20from%20their%20mothers)), which aligns with common cash crops of the region). Additionally, Wren operated **"Wren's Tavern"**, an inn in Falls Church, from 1789 until his death ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201789,%20Wren%20was,36)). It is likely that enslaved workers staffed the tavern, cooking, cleaning, and serving guests, thereby directly contributing to Wren's income and hospitality business (though specific tavern slave rosters aren't recorded, this was typical for the time). In summary, Wren's day-to-day economic life – from agriculture to commercial hospitality – was supported by the labor of the people he enslaved.

## Enslaved Labor in Wren's Projects and Community

**Building of The Falls Church (1767–69):** One of James Wren's most noted achievements was designing and overseeing construction of the brick Anglican church that gave the town of Falls Church its name. Contemporary accounts and research make clear that this **1769 church was built by enslaved workers** under Wren's direction ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20new%20church%20was%20designed,6)). A historical marker and local histories note that, unable to find sufficient paid laborers, Wren,*""a slaveowner,"* used his own and possibly others' enslaved people as the construction workforce for the church ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20new%20church%20was%20designed,6)). These skilled enslaved artisans and laborers made the bricks, laid the walls, did carpentry, and otherwise executed Wren's plans. Their contributions went largely unheralded for centuries; however, the modern congregation has acknowledged this fact. In 2017 The Falls Church Episcopal installed a plaque honoring **"the enslaved people whose skills and labor helped build The Falls Church,"** offering gratitude and repentance for their toil ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=match%20at%20L340%20enslaved%20laborers,was%20deemed%20not%20strong%20enough)). This enduring colonial church – a physical centerpiece of the community – literally rests on foundations laid by enslaved African Americans. Thus, Wren's legacy as an architect is inseparable from the enslaved hands that built his designs.

**Other Construction Projects:** Besides The Falls Church, James Wren also designed prominent buildings like Christ Church in Alexandria (1773) and Pohick Church (1774), and later the Fairfax County Courthouse (1799) ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=By%20the%201760s,%20he%20had,These%20plaques%20are%20original%20to)) ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Pohick%20Church%20%20in%201774,9)). While specific labor records are scant, it was common in that era for slaveholding builders to use enslaved craftsmen in such projects. Indeed, Wren's own **enslaved blacksmith (Charles)** is mentioned in his will ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)), indicating Wren kept skilled tradespeople. It's highly likely that Wren's enslaved workers traveled with him or were rented out for construction work on these projects in Northern Virginia, though direct documentation of which individuals worked on which site isn't available. The key point is that Wren's architectural accomplishments and expansions of infrastructure were enabled by enslaved labor – a fact now part of the fuller historical narrative told by local historians ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20Falls%20Church%20,The%20Wren)) ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=church%20using%20enslaved%20labor24,congregation,%20further%20entwining%20the%20church%27s)).

## Transactions and Slave Trade Involvement

**Slave Purchases/Sales:** We have no evidence that James Wren was actively involved in the wider **slave trade** (e.g. as a slave broker or regular buyer/seller at markets). Rather, his role was that of a **slaveholder** who maintained a stable slave workforce for decades and passed them on to his heirs. The historical record (wills, deeds, and newspapers) has not revealed any advertisements placed by Wren to sell slaves or notices of purchase, nor mentions of his participation in slave auctions. The enslaved people appear to have been either **inherited or acquired by marriage** and then kept on his properties. For instance, some individuals were already "in the possession" of his children before Wren died, suggesting he had given or lent enslaved servants to them during his lifetime ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). This family-oriented transfer contrasts with slave traders who treated people purely as commodities for profit. 

**Estate Distribution:** The primary "transactions" involving Wren's slaves were through inheritance. In his will, Wren divided his enslaved property among family members rather than selling them off for estate cash. Each slave or family unit is assigned to a wife or child by name ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=These%20enslaved%20persons%20were%20named,1)). This means that **enslaved families were split between heirs** – for example, one enslaved woman named Sall went to Wren's daughter Hannah Adams, and two of Sall's children (Jane and Hannan) were included with their mother ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20daughter%20Hannah%20Adams%20,her%20possession%20already)). Another woman, Milly, and her child Anna went to a different daughter, Mary Dulin ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=)). Nelly, as noted, was allocated to his son. In one case, Wren had already in 1806 given two enslaved people (Will and Janney) to the family of his deceased daughter Betty Hughes ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20children%20of%20daughter%20Betty,in%20the%20spring%20of%201806)). These records show Wren's involvement in **slave transactions was largely patriarchal estate management** – distributing human property among his kin – rather than commercial trading with outside parties. 

**Manumission (Emancipation) Efforts:** Notably, James Wren **did not himself free** any of his slaves during his lifetime, as far as records indicate. However, **his widow, Sarah Wren, held anti-slavery sentiments** and took significant action after his death. Sarah (his second wife) inherited several people under the will and, according to local history, **"made arrangements for some of the family's slaves to be freed when they came of age and were educated, and the rest of the Wren family slaves were freed after Sarah's death."** ([Col. James Wren](https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~bobfarmergenealogy/genealogy/Farmer001/ps38/ps38_231.htm#:~:text=convert%20to%20Methodism,%20and%20two,%E2%80%9D)) In May 1816 – just months after James's passing – Sarah Wren recorded a deed of manumission in Fairfax County to emancipate a number of the enslaved. For example, an enslaved man named *John Henry* was emancipated by Sarah's deed in 1816 (at about age 11) and later formally registered as free in 1833 when he reached adulthood ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=inches%20high,%2028%20years%20old,my%20office%20pursuant%20to%20Law)). Another enslaved youth, *Jeffrey*, was indentured to serve until age 28 and then freed per Sarah Wren's arrangement (this was executed via a sale in trust to a Quaker neighbor, as evidenced by an 1831 court record) ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=The%20Bearer%20hereof%20Jeffrey%20a,Given%20under%20my%20hand%20this)) ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=The%20Bearer%20hereof%20Jeffrey%20a,Given%20under%20my%20hand%20this)). These maneuvers were designed to comply with restrictive Virginia laws by effectively instituting a **gradual emancipation** within the Wren household. By the terms of Sarah Wren's will (probated 1816), any remaining enslaved persons in her estate were to be liberated unconditionally ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=match%20at%20L8112%20the%20will,he%20is%20the%20same%20person)) ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=match%20at%20L15988%20Sarah%20Wren,%20the%20State%20of%20Virginia%20Whereupon)). 

It appears that by the time Sarah Wren died (the exact year is a bit uncertain, but her will was probated in 1816 ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=match%20at%20L15988%20Sarah%20Wren,%20the%20State%20of%20Virginia%20Whereupon)), implying she died soon after James), *all the Wren slaves she controlled were set on the path to freedom*. Some were freed outright, and others by a certain age. **Importantly, Nelly was *not* among those freed**, since Nelly had been left to James Jr. (a different portion of the estate). This detail aligns with the user's narrative that *"I was not among those fortunate enough to be released from bondage"* when Sarah Wren freed her slaves ([_index.md](file://file-B83M9svcZJYp5XVLqtmj3n#:~:text=,bondage,%20the%20news%20stirred%20something)). Thus, James Wren's family shows a split legacy: while James himself perpetuated slavery, his wife took steps to end it for their household's enslaved people, illustrating the complex attitudes even within one family.

## Enslaved Individuals and the Community's History

**Impact on the Early Falls Church Community:** The people enslaved by James Wren were very much part of the early 19th-century Falls Church area community – though in bondage, they lived, labored, and even worshiped (likely in the segregated gallery or outdoor gatherings) in that vicinity. Their role in constructing the landmark church in 1767–69 has now been publicly commemorated, as mentioned above. Beyond that, after emancipation (either the piecemeal 1816 manumissions or the general emancipation of 1865), these individuals or their descendants became part of the local free Black population. For example, **Julia Ann** (recorded as "Julia Ann Far"), a woman freed by Sarah Wren's 1816 will, remained in Fairfax County and raised a family there – her children Jefferson and Catharine Far were noted as free born in the 1850s, thanks to their mother's liberation in the Wren household ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=inches%20high,%20is%20the%20son,free%20negro,%20according%20to%20law)) ([Full text of "Registration Of Free Negroes, 1822-1861, County of Fairfax"](https://archive.org/stream/RegistrationOfFreeNegroes/Registration%20of%20Free%20Negroes_djvu.txt#:~:text=Virginia%20to%20wit)). Likewise, some formerly enslaved by the Wrens were able to acquire property or money; it is recorded that **several of the Wren family's freed slaves later accumulated enough wealth to buy household items from the Wren estate at auction** ([Col. James Wren](https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~bobfarmergenealogy/genealogy/Farmer001/ps38/ps38_231.htm#:~:text=2nd%20wife,%20Sarah,%20made%20arrangements,%E2%80%9D)). This remarkable detail suggests they stayed in the area, became economically active, and directly interacted with the Wren family's material legacy as free citizens.

**Continuity of Enslavement until Civil War:** Not all of Wren's enslaved individuals gained freedom in 1816. Those who went to Wren's adult children presumably remained enslaved for years afterward. James Wren Jr., for instance, still owned Nelly and others. We do not have a full account of James Jr.'s handling of his slaves, but given that Fairfax County was not subject to large-scale private manumissions after the 1820s, it's likely Nelly and her fellow bondspersons in the next generation remained enslaved up to the Civil War era. During the Civil War, Falls Church's church building was used by Union troops (and no longer by a slaveholding congregation) ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Confederate%20Ranger%20Colonel%20John%20S,colonial%20town%2C%20through%20the%20Civil)) ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=commemorates%20Confederate%20soldiers%20buried%20here,%E2%80%9D)), and by 1863–65 enslaved people in Northern Virginia were being freed by Union occupation and the Emancipation Proclamation. It's conceivable that Nelly (by then perhaps an elderly woman) or her children witnessed freedom only with the collapse of the Confederacy. In that sense, the **history of the Wren slaves intertwines with the broader trajectory of slavery in the community** – from colonial times, through partial early emancipations, to final abolition during the Civil War. Falls Church, like much of Fairfax County, transformed from a society with enslaved labor forming its backbone to a place where emancipated African Americans struggled to build new lives. The presence of a small free Black community prior to the war (bolstered in part by Sarah Wren's emancipations) and the larger freed population after the war are both chapters of Falls Church history to which the Wren enslaved individuals contributed.

**Wealth and Institution Building:** James Wren's own prosperity and social standing (he was a vestryman, a militia colonel, a judge, and even Sheriff of Fairfax County ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Sheriff%20of%20Fairfax%20County,%20Virginia,aged%C2%A086%E2%80%9387)) ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=))) were enabled by slavery, as was typical of Virginia gentry. The elegant **Falls Church building itself is a tangible legacy of enslaved labor**, now recognized by the church's leadership in an act of reconciliation ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=match%20at%20L340%20enslaved%20laborers,was%20deemed%20not%20strong%20enough)). By exploring Nelly's story and those of Wren's other slaves, modern researchers and the local community gain a more complete and honest narrative of Falls Church's past – one that includes the voices and experiences of the enslaved. In recent years, public history efforts (plaques, tours, and research projects) in Falls Church have explicitly connected figures like James Wren and the people he enslaved to the city's development. For instance, the City of Falls Church's official history materials acknowledge that **"both churches were likely built with enslaved labor"**, crediting those unnamed workers ([[PDF] The Story of Falls Church The People to 1700 - Granicus](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359#:~:text=,that%20gave%20the%20City)), and the Falls Church Episcopal archives are helping to *"re-write a more inclusive telling of the history of the city"* that features the Black experience ([Our Commitment to Racial Justice | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/copy-of-the-community#:~:text=devoted%20exclusively%20to%20racial%20justice,%20the%20city%20of%20Falls%20Church)).

In conclusion, **James Wren was a prominent local slaveholder whose wealth, public works, and family life were deeply entangled with slavery**. He owned about twenty enslaved people, depended on their labor for building projects (notably The Falls Church in 1769) ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20new%20church%20was%20designed,6)) and for operating his plantation and tavern, and he passed them on to his heirs rather than selling them on the open market ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=These%20enslaved%20persons%20were%20named,1)). While he himself did not free his slaves, his widow Sarah Wren took the extraordinary step of emancipating those she inherited, marking an early instance of manumission in the area ([Col. James Wren](https://freepages.rootsweb.com/~bobfarmergenealogy/genealogy/Farmer001/ps38/ps38_231.htm#:~:text=convert%20to%20Methodism,%20and%20two,%E2%80%9D)). The lives of Wren's enslaved individuals, such as Nelly, are part of the fabric of Falls Church's history – from the bricks of its church to the post-war Black community. Ongoing research into wills, church records, and census data continues to shed light on these individuals, ensuring that they are no longer just footnotes but central to the narrative of Falls Church. Each discovery – like the name *Nelly* tucked in an 1815 will – allows us to **humanize the past** and remember that the "voices from the past" include those of the enslaved, whose stories are finally being heard ([_index.md](file://file-B83M9svcZJYp5XVLqtmj3n#:~:text=saw%20families%20torn%20apart%20by,p)).
