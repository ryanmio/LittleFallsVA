# Samuel R. Styles: Segregationist Civic Leader in Falls Church's Jim Crow Era

## Civic Roles and the 1915 Segregation Ordinance in Falls Church

Samuel R. Styles (d. 1943) was a prominent white civic figure in Falls Church during the 1910s, known chiefly for his role in instituting a residential segregation ordinance. He served on the Falls Church Town Council and leveraged his position to advance Jim Crow housing policies. In November 1914, amid rising white hostility to Black neighbors, Styles (who lived at the historic Cherry Hill property) joined Councilman Dr. Reginald Munson to introduce an ordinance that would make it unlawful to sell or rent property to Black people ("the negro race") in designated parts of town. This measure was prompted by the mayor's alarm that an African American was about to rent a home in a white area, reflecting panic over even a single Black family moving into West Falls Church. While that initial proposal was narrowly voted down (Styles and Munson voted in favor, but a majority of councilmen opposed it), the effort did not stop there.

Armed with a 1912 Virginia law empowering localities to create "segregation districts", Styles and his allies persisted. In January 1915, Styles helped drive the issue forward again. He was a key member of a special "Segregation Committee" formed by the Council to formalize the color line under the authority of the new state law. On January 11, 1915, despite vocal objections from Black residents (detailed later), the Falls Church Town Council passed a strengthened residential segregation ordinance by a 4–1 vote. Styles was among the majority voting in favor of this law, which established separate residential zones for white and Black people within the town. The ordinance's intent was explicit: to confine the town's Black community to a small "Colored District" and bar them from living or purchasing property elsewhere in Falls Church. Under the new law, 32% of the town's population (the African American residents) would be restricted to about 5% of the town's land area. Black families already owning homes outside the proposed Black section could theoretically remain, but no new Black residents would be allowed in the white-designated areas – a violation could be treated as a misdemeanor and fined, effectively making much of Falls Church a sundown town for African Americans.

Styles and his colleagues thus engineered one of Virginia's most aggressive local segregation ordinances, aiming to cordon off an historically integrated community into rigid racial enclaves. As a Falls Church councilman, Styles did not limit his influence to the 1915 vote alone. He continued to support segregationist policies in subsequent years, working to reshape local housing development along racial lines. In fact, evidence shows that Styles partnered with Washington, D.C.-based real estate attorney Harry Birge – another ardent proponent of segregated housing – to promote racially restrictive measures in Falls Church's new subdivisions during the 1920s. Birge was described by researchers as having "an agenda to segregate Falls Church, pushing wherever he can," and Styles joined him in this cause. The Falls Church library archives contain a 1915 letter from Black activist E.B. Henderson addressed to "Birge and partner Samuel Styles," challenging their push for a segregationist zoning ordinance. Henderson pointedly wrote: "We would like to know your reasons for favoring this [zoning ordinance] legislation… We have been told it is feared by you that colored people may buy property near you and other white residents and thereby lower the value of your property." This contemporary letter identifies Styles as a leading advocate of the segregation ordinance, motivated (in Henderson's understanding) by the racist notion that Black neighbors would depress white property values.

In summary, Samuel R. Styles was deeply involved in Falls Church civic affairs as a Town Council member and was the central figure driving the 1915 residential segregation law, using his office to formalize racial separation in housing. His civic role, unfortunately, became defined by this attempt to bar Black citizens from equal residency in the town.

## White Supremacist Politics and Styles' Ideology

Styles' actions must be understood in the context of Jim Crow–era white supremacist politics in Virginia, which profoundly influenced Falls Church. By the 1910s, Virginia's political establishment had already entrenched white supremacy through measures like the 1902 state constitution (which disenfranchised most Black voters) and statutes segregating public life. Racial segregation was promoted under the guise of "public morals, public health and public order" – language enshrined in the 1912 state law that expressly authorized cities and towns to designate separate residential districts by race. Styles was ideologically aligned with this movement. He and his fellow councilors echoed the prevailing belief that Black presence in white neighborhoods was a threat to social order and property values. The Falls Church segregation ordinance's preamble borrowed directly from state code, asserting that the "residence of white and colored people in close proximity" endangered the welfare of the community. In practice, this was thinly veiled racist pseudoscience: a legal cover for enforcing the idea that Black people should not live among whites.

Styles' endorsement of such an ordinance places him firmly in line with the white supremacist ideology of the day, which insisted on absolute racial separation in housing as well as in public facilities. Publicly, Styles and his supporters framed their efforts as a reasonable community safeguard, but the real ideological underpinning was blatant white supremacy. The timing of Falls Church's 1915 ordinance was no coincidence. National and regional racism was surging, fueled by events like the blockbuster film *The Birth of a Nation*, which premiered in early 1915 and glorified the Ku Klux Klan. That film's popularity led to a spike in KKK membership across the country, and Falls Church experienced its own rise in racial animus concurrently with the segregation law. White supremacist activity in Northern Virginia was on the upswing: the revived Klan was active in Falls Church, going so far as to burn crosses to terrorize Black residents who resisted racial dictates. (Local histories note that Klan members burned a cross near the home of E.B. Henderson on South Maple Avenue as a warning after the ordinance fight began.) While we have no record of Styles openly affiliating with the KKK, he operated within and benefited from this atmosphere of intimidation and "Jim Crow" consensus.

His own statements in council meetings were not extensively documented in print, but his actions spoke loudly. Styles readily seized on the fear of a Black family moving into town, treating it as an emergency requiring legal action. This reaction demonstrates his adherence to the belief that Falls Church should remain a de facto white enclave. Moreover, Styles' coordination with figures like Harry Birge – a developer who inserted aggressive whites-only covenants in property deeds – highlights his commitment to a rigid ideology of racial exclusion beyond just official ordinances. Together, Birge and Styles pursued a vision of Falls Church as a segregated community by any means available, public or private. Henderson's 1915 letter reveals the perceived mindset of Styles and his cohort: they "feared… that colored people may buy property near [them]" and thus fought to preempt Black neighbors at all costs. This aligns perfectly with white supremacist thinking in the early 20th century, which cast Black citizens as undesirable "outsiders" whose mere presence was thought to devalue white communities.

In sum, Samuel R. Styles' political actions and associations show him to be squarely aligned with the white supremacist wing of Virginia politics. He was not a passive product of the times but an active agent of Jim Crow segregation in Northern Virginia, working to translate racist ideology into local law. His influence helped shape Falls Church's racial policies in line with the wider segregationist movement, illustrating how even a small town just outside the nation's capital was swept up in (and contributed to) the tide of white supremacist politics.

## Community Reactions: White Support and Black Resistance

Styles' segregationist initiative in 1915 drew mixed reactions within Falls Church – largely split along racial lines. Among the town's white population, there was substantial support for the new ordinance. In fact, after the Council's January vote, the town government decided to gauge public sentiment by holding a special referendum on segregation. On May 25, 1915, Falls Church convened its (exclusively white) qualified voters to cast ballots on whether to officially segregate the town. The result was a decisive approval of segregation by the white electorate. Backing from white constituents emboldened Styles and the council's pro-segregation majority to proceed with implementing the policy. One month later, at a June 28, 1915 meeting, the Town Council formally adopted a mapped plan dividing Falls Church into "white" and "colored" sections. This enactment effectively confirmed that most white residents endorsed codifying a Black ghetto within the town, confining Black citizens to a cramped district on Tinner Hill (at the town's edge) and keeping the rest of Falls Church off-limits to them.

Contemporary accounts indicate little organized white opposition to Styles' ordinance. Only one white councilman, Jesse Harmon, consistently voted against these measures in 1914–15, and there's no record of significant white-led protests. If anything, some in the white community pushed for even more stringent measures. The local Ku Klux Klan presence and the absence of public white dissent suggest that many white Falls Church residents either actively supported or silently accepted Styles' segregation plan. As one local history puts it, by challenging segregation, Black activists were defying "the actions of the majority of citizens in Falls Church on a matter that was as close to religion in their hearts". In other words, the white majority's commitment to segregation was intense, akin to a core belief, and Styles was acting with that majority's blessing.

In stark contrast, Falls Church's Black community responded to Styles' ordinance with immediate and courageous resistance. As soon as word spread in early January 1915 that the Town Council intended to segregate housing, Black leaders mobilized to fight back. On January 8, 1915 – just days before the council's vote – Dr. Edwin Bancroft "E.B." Henderson called a meeting of nine prominent Black citizens at the home of Joseph Tinner. Henderson, a nationally known educator and civil rights advocate, and Tinner, a respected Black stonemason and property owner, led this group in forming the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL). The CCPL was the first organized civil rights coalition in Falls Church, established explicitly to oppose Styles' segregation ordinance.

Over the next weeks, Henderson (as CCPL secretary) and Tinner (CCPL president) orchestrated a multi-pronged resistance campaign. They drafted letters and petitions to Falls Church's mayor and Town Council arguing that the segregation law violated their rights under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. They also launched a letter-writing campaign to local institutions, sending appeals to white churches, businesses, and every council member asking where they stood on the proposed ordinance. This was a bold move to shame or sway potential white allies, though it appears few, if any, answered the call in support. Crucially, on January 11, 1915 – the night of the Council vote – a delegation of Black citizens (the CCPL members) attended the meeting and "read papers objecting to the ordinance" directly to Styles and his colleagues. Henderson personally addressed the all-white council and pleaded with them not to approve such an unjust law. Despite this impassioned protest, the council (Styles included) ignored the Black residents' testimony and passed the segregation ordinance that same night.

The immediate rejection did not deter Henderson, Tinner, and the CCPL – if anything, it spurred them to intensify their fight. After the ordinance passed, Black resistance moved to the courts and to broader organizational tactics. The CCPL quickly secured legal counsel, retaining attorney T. L. Jones of Washington, D.C. (a Black lawyer) to challenge the ordinance in court. In October 1915, their lawsuit yielded an initial victory: a Fairfax County Circuit Court judge issued a rule blocking Falls Church from enforcing the segregation law pending further review. This injunction meant that the January 1916 target date for the ordinance to take effect came and went without any families being forced to move. The case became entangled with similar litigation elsewhere in Virginia – notably, Black residents of Richmond and Ashland also sued over segregation laws. For a time, the Virginia Supreme Court allowed those other towns' ordinances to stand, and in mid-1916 the local court in Fairfax actually reversed course and upheld Falls Church's law.

Even then, the CCPL did not relent. Recognizing the need for a stronger, national ally, Henderson reached out to W.E.B. Du Bois and the NAACP. In a Jan. 20, 1915 letter, Henderson described Falls Church's crisis and sought permission to affiliate the CCPL with the NAACP, which at that time required 50 members to form a branch. By 1918, this persistence paid off – Falls Church's CCPL was chartered as the Falls Church and Vicinity NAACP, the first rural branch of the NAACP in the United States. The Black resistance led by Tinner and Henderson ultimately triumphed legally when, in November 1917, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in *Buchanan v. Warley*. In that case (coincidentally involving a similar ordinance in Louisville, Kentucky), the Supreme Court ruled that government-imposed residential segregation violated the 14th Amendment. This ruling nullified Falls Church's segregation ordinance before it could ever be enforced. Henderson and his comrades justly celebrated the outcome: their steadfast opposition had prevented any evictions under the law and struck a blow against institutionalized housing segregation. E.B. Henderson later wrote that the Falls Church ordinance "had never been enforced" thanks to their pressure.

In summary, white constituents largely approved of Styles' segregationist legislation, while the Black community mounted a groundbreaking resistance. The white majority's response ranged from active encouragement (as seen in the referendum and Klan intimidation) to passive acquiescence; there is little evidence of white residents sympathizing with the Black objections at that time. On the other side, Black Falls Church citizens formed an organized front, the CCPL, which evolved into an NAACP branch – all in direct response to Styles' ordinance. Their efforts not only stopped the local law but also became part of the early 20th-century civil rights struggle. This dynamic highlights how Samuel R. Styles' actions inadvertently galvanized one of the first sustained civil rights campaigns in Northern Virginia, even as he was aligned with those who sought to suppress Black agency.

## Legacy, Mary Riley Styles' Reputation, and Public Memory

The legacy of Samuel R. Styles in Falls Church is a study in contrasts – on one hand, a man who wielded local power to enforce racist policies, and on the other, the husband of one of Falls Church's most beloved civic benefactors, Mary Riley Styles. This contrast has led to a complicated and often muted memory of Styles in the community.

Mary Riley Styles, Samuel's wife, was a highly respected figure in Falls Church. She devoted decades to civic causes, most notably the establishment and growth of the town's public library. For over 25 years, Mary chaired the Falls Church Women's Club Library Committee, tirelessly raising funds and managing the small volunteer-run library. The library's success and eventual transition into a public institution were largely credited to her leadership and generosity. Upon her retirement in 1945, tributes poured in acknowledging that "the library is largely indebted to her loyalty and faithful service". After Mary's death in 1946, the city's new library building was constructed on land donated by the Styles family, and in 1958 it opened to the public. By 1977, the library was formally renamed the "Mary Riley Styles Public Library" in her honor, cementing her status as a civic icon. To this day, Mary Riley Styles is fondly remembered in Falls Church – her name graces the library, and local history accounts celebrate her contributions to literacy, education, and community life.

In contrast, Samuel R. Styles' role has been largely minimized or left out of public commemorations until recently, despite his significance in the town's racial history. For much of the 20th century, local historical narratives focused on positive achievements (like Mary's library work) while glossing over the 1915 segregation ordinance and those behind it. There was little public discussion of the fact that the husband of the library's namesake had once tried to bar Black citizens from owning or renting homes in Falls Church. In effect, Styles' segregationist legacy was quietly obscured as Falls Church celebrated its image as a friendly "Little City."

The city's official histories and landmarks reflected this selective memory. For example, Cherry Hill Farmhouse (the Riley/Styles family home) is preserved as a 19th-century museum without reference to the segregation drama that unfolded in 1915, and the library's own historical timeline lauds Mary Riley Styles' philanthropy with no mention of Samuel's racist politics. This omission was so pronounced that even as Falls Church marked progressive milestones, the dark chapter of 1915 remained relatively hidden. A recent Falls Church News-Press investigation noted that the city's past is "part prominent and part ignored," citing the "eye-opening" omission of historical details like racially exclusionary housing policies. Indeed, the story of the segregation ordinance and Styles' involvement was not widely told in public fora for many years.

It wasn't until the late 20th and early 21st centuries – as descendants of Black activists and local historians pushed for recognition – that the full history began coming to light. In 1998, for instance, The Washington Post reported on Falls Church's role in NAACP history, prompting reflection on the events of 1915. And in 1999, the City of Falls Church City Council formally rescinded the 1915 segregation ordinance and issued a public apology for it, an official acknowledgment of the wrong that had lingered on the books (symbolically, if not enforced) for decades.

Today, there is a growing effort to reckon with Samuel R. Styles' actions as part of Falls Church's history, though it remains a delicate subject because of his connection to Mary Riley Styles. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library itself has begun to include this context in its educational materials. A library web article on desegregation candidly notes that "in 1914, Falls Church Council members, including Samuel Styles, husband of Mary Riley Styles, proposed and approved racially restrictive zoning measures that would have banned Black citizens from owning property in Falls Church." It goes on to acknowledge that Black residents (like E.B. Henderson) organized and successfully challenged those ordinances. This kind of forthright institutional statement is recent, reflecting a commitment to more honest storytelling. Similarly, the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation and local scholars have ensured that Sites like Tinner Hill (the historically Black neighborhood and NAACP birthplace) are recognized and memorialized, indirectly shining light on the figures (like Styles) whose oppressive actions made such resistance necessary.

Still, in the broader popular memory of Falls Church, Samuel R. Styles is not a well-known name. There are no public schools or streets bearing his name, no plaques recalling his tenure on the Town Council – in stark contrast to his wife Mary, whose name is emblazoned on the library and honored at civic events. This gap underscores how communities often prefer to celebrate heroes and positive builders (like Mary Riley Styles) while downplaying or forgetting the proponents of racist policies.

By examining Styles' legacy alongside his wife's, we see how Falls Church's public memory has been sanitized. Mary's genuine good works have effectively provided cover for Samuel's misdeeds, albeit unintentionally. For generations, the emphasis on Mary's contributions allowed the uncomfortable part of the Styles family story to remain in the shadows. Only with a modern push for truthful, inclusive history has Samuel R. Styles' central role in enforcing segregation been explicitly named and critiqued. This reevaluation does not diminish Mary Riley Styles' accomplishments, but it adds necessary nuance to Falls Church's history: the same family that gave the city a library also produced a councilman who tried to deny Black citizens the right to live where they chose. A more honest public history now acknowledges both sides of that legacy.

In doing so, Falls Church is beginning to confront the full story of how local power – wielded by people like Samuel R. Styles – was used to enforce segregation, and how Black residents heroically resisted, ultimately bending the arc of the city's history toward justice.
