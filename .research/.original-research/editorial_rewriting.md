Who Really Rewrote Falls Church History?

Recent debates around Confederate monuments and markers in Falls Church have often framed the removal of these symbols as "rewriting history." But what if history had already been rewritten decades ago, not by modern historians, but by the very individuals who first memorialized it?

Our original research reveals a fascinating local example. Melvin Lee Steadman Jr., revered as Falls Church's premier historian in the mid-20th century, significantly shaped how the city understood its past. In his influential 1964 book, Falls Church by Fence and Fireside, Steadman popularized the legend of "Hangman's Tree," an oak tree allegedly used by Confederate Colonel John Mosby to hang Union spies during the Civil War. Despite little historical evidence supporting this, Steadman's compelling storytelling ensured this legend became firmly rooted in community memory.

In 1968, inspired directly by Steadman's narrative, the Falls Church Historical Commission created a plaque commemorating this "legend," effectively rewriting local history by transforming an unsubstantiated folktale into official historical narrative.

When contemporary residents decided recently to remove the plaque—correcting a historical inaccuracy—they were accused of "rewriting history." Yet the truth is clear: modern historians aren't the ones rewriting history; they're merely correcting an earlier rewrite.

Falls Church now faces broader questions: whose stories deserve memorialization, and how do we responsibly preserve history? True historical accuracy demands continued reevaluation—not the preservation of comforting myths. It's time we reconsider who truly rewrote Falls Church history.
