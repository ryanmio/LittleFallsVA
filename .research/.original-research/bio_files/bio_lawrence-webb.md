# Lawrence Webb: Falls Church’s Trailblazer for Inclusive Leadership

## Breaking Barriers in the Little City
**Lawrence Webb** (born 1975) is an academic administrator and civic leader who made history as the first openly gay African-American elected official in the Commonwealth of Virginia ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=May%206%20saw%20several%20elections,American%20elected%20in%20the%20commonwealth)). In May 2008, Webb won a seat on the Falls Church City Council, breaking new ground for representation in the state. His election was hard-fought – he captured one of three available Council seats by a margin of just 39 votes ([First Black Gay Elected in Virginia](https://www.advocate.com/news/2008/05/09/first-black-gay-elected-virginia#:~:text=Virginia%20voters%20on%20Tuesday%20elected,won%20the%20other%20two%20seats)) – and it marked a milestone for both LGBTQ+ and African-American visibility in Virginia politics. Webb, then 33, hoped his victory would **“open the door for others to get involved in public service,”** regardless of whether they were gay or Black or both ([2008 - Explore a Year in LGBTQ History | Pride & Progress](https://www.prideandprogress.org/years/2008#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20hope%20my%20election%20opens,%E2%80%9D)). In a city that had seen few Black elected officials before, Webb’s win was celebrated as a sign that Falls Church was embracing a more inclusive and representative civic identity.

## Early Life and Path to Falls Church
Webb was born and raised in the small town of Kenbridge in south-central Virginia. He attended Shenandoah University, where he earned a B.A. in Mass Communications and a graduate certificate in public management ([Lawrence Webb - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Webb#:~:text=Born%20in%20Kenbridge%2C%20Virginia%20%2C,4)). While at Shenandoah, Webb made his first foray into leadership – he became the university’s first African-American student government president, a role that foreshadowed his future in public service ([Lawrence Webb - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Webb#:~:text=Born%20in%20Kenbridge%2C%20Virginia%20%2C,4)). After college, he built a career in higher education administration, holding admissions and recruitment positions at several Virginia institutions. By the mid-2000s he was an assistant dean of admissions at the University of Mary Washington, working with programs like the James Farmer Scholars to mentor underrepresented youth ([3 Falls Church City Council Members Take Oath of Office; Mayor & Vice Mayor Elected - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2008/07/02/3-falls-church-city-council-members-take-oath-of-office-mayor-and-vice-mayor-elected/#:~:text=Webb%20is%20an%20Assistant%20Dean,Recreation%20%26%20Parks%20Advisory%20Board)). He also served on a state Board of Correctional Education (appointed by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2004), eventually chairing that board and advocating for educational opportunities for incarcerated youth ([3 Falls Church City Council Members Take Oath of Office; Mayor & Vice Mayor Elected - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2008/07/02/3-falls-church-city-council-members-take-oath-of-office-mayor-and-vice-mayor-elected/#:~:text=visits%2C%20cultural%20and%20recreational%20activities%2C,Recreation%20%26%20Parks%20Advisory%20Board)).

In 2005 Webb and his partner, Clifton Taylor, moved to the City of Falls Church, drawn by its close-knit community feel ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=of%20%E2%80%9997%20%E2%80%93elected%20to%20serve,Shenandoah%20University%20in%20Winchester%2C%20Va)) ([Where We Live - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/10/where-we-live/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-we-live#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20also%20the%20obviously%20gay%2C,elected%20to%20office%20in%20Virginia)). Webb wasted no time getting involved. He joined the Falls Church City Democratic Committee and connected with longtime civic leaders who showed him “the inner workings of the city” ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=When%20Clifton%20and%20I%20moved,inner%20workings%20of%20the%20city)). He also volunteered on the city’s Recreation & Parks Advisory Board for three years, helping guide local park improvements ([3 Falls Church City Council Members Take Oath of Office; Mayor & Vice Mayor Elected - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2008/07/02/3-falls-church-city-council-members-take-oath-of-office-mayor-and-vice-mayor-elected/#:~:text=visits%2C%20cultural%20and%20recreational%20activities%2C,Recreation%20%26%20Parks%20Advisory%20Board)). These roles immersed Webb in Falls Church’s civic life and built his reputation as an energetic, community-focused resident. By 2008, just three years after settling in “the Little City,” Webb was ready to run for office – spurred by a lifelong desire to serve his community and encouraged by neighbors who saw his dedication ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9DThat%E2%80%99s%20correct%20as%20far%20as,%E2%80%9D)) ([Webb Talks F.C.

## Making History on Falls Church City Council
Webb entered the 2008 Falls Church City Council race as something of a newcomer, but one with deepening local ties and broad support. He sought and earned the endorsement of the Citizens for a Better City (CBC), a influential nonpartisan civic group, which boosted his credibility with voters ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=Webb%20adds%20that%20while%20his,emphatic%20that%20race%20never%20was)). He also received backing from the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which recognized the historic significance of his candidacy and aided his get-out-the-vote efforts ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=Another%20endorsement%20Webb%20secured%20helped,needed%20in%20this%20tight%20race)) ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9DThey%20did%20a%20great%20amount,%E2%80%9D)). On Election Day, May 6, 2008, Webb placed third in a seven-person race with about 18.9% of the vote, securing the final Council seat by a razor-thin margin ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=May%206%20saw%20several%20elections,American%20elected%20in%20the%20commonwealth)) ([First Black Gay Elected in Virginia](https://www.advocate.com/news/2008/05/09/first-black-gay-elected-virginia#:~:text=Virginia%20voters%20on%20Tuesday%20elected,won%20the%20other%20two%20seats)). When he was sworn in on July 1, 2008, Falls Church City made state history: Lawrence Webb became the first openly gay Black elected official in Virginia ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=May%206%20saw%20several%20elections,American%20elected%20in%20the%20commonwealth)).

 ([image]()) *Lawrence Webb (top row, second from right) stands with his fellow Falls Church City Council members in 2008 after being sworn in. Webb’s election made him the first openly gay Black elected official in Virginia history ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=May%206%20saw%20several%20elections,American%20elected%20in%20the%20commonwealth)).* 

Webb’s groundbreaking win drew praise and attention beyond Falls Church. “Lawrence’s historic win is just one example” of LGBTQ candidates making strides, said the Victory Fund’s CEO in a press release, noting how Webb’s campaign energized volunteers in that close race ([First Black Gay Elected in Virginia](https://www.advocate.com/news/2008/05/09/first-black-gay-elected-virginia#:~:text=,%28The%20Advocate)). But locally, Webb downplayed the identity labels and emphasized community service. “I looked at the election as an opportunity to serve my community,” he said, describing public service as a longtime dream ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9DThat%E2%80%99s%20correct%20as%20far%20as,%E2%80%9D)). Many Falls Church residents, a generally progressive and highly educated bunch, were unfazed by Webb’s race or sexual orientation ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=Webb%20adds%20that%20while%20his,emphatic%20that%20race%20never%20was)) ([Where We Live - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/10/where-we-live/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-we-live#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20also%20the%20obviously%20gay%2C,elected%20to%20office%20in%20Virginia)). *“Falls Church is a very progressive city…People here are very educated,”* Webb observed, noting that being a Black gay man was largely a non-issue to voters ([Where We Live - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/10/where-we-live/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-we-live#:~:text=in%20this%20largely%20European,elected%20to%20office%20in%20Virginia)). His election nevertheless had profound symbolic impact. In a jurisdiction that is majority white and had seen precious few Black officials in its history (the first African American City Council member dated back decades prior) ([Mayor Hardi’s Weekly Report - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2024/08/10/mayor-hardis-weekly-report/#:~:text=va,Church%2C%20will%20be%20great%20additions)), Webb’s presence on the dais sent a powerful message of inclusion. He became a role model for minority representation in the city, even as he made clear that he intended to represent all Falls Church citizens.

## Leading Falls Church Through Change (2008–2012)
During his four-year term on the Falls Church City Council, Webb quickly proved himself a proactive and thoughtful leader. He came into office with a platform centered on controlled, community-friendly development – advocating for “measured, thoughtful” growth that would favor small businesses and maintain the city’s unique character over big-box commercial projects ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=%E2%80%9DMy%20agenda%20is%20to%20make,%E2%80%9D)). Once in office, however, Webb’s tenure was soon defined by unexpected challenges. The 2008 economic recession hit Falls Church hard, shrinking revenues and forcing painful choices. *“During those four years [on Council] were some of the toughest the city faced,”* Webb later recalled, noting that the Council had to consider laying off staff and raising taxes to keep the city afloat ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=During%20those%20four%20years%20were,and%20raising%20taxes%20were%20made)). The crash course in crisis governance tested the first-term councilman, but he worked with his colleagues to steer Falls Church through the downturn with its finances intact.

Despite the strained economy, Webb managed to advance initiatives that aligned with his values of civic inclusion and engagement. Notably, he championed a successful effort to shift Falls Church’s local elections from May to November – a move aimed at boosting voter turnout and participation ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=I%20brought%20up%20this%20topic,willing%20to%20take%20this%20on)). Webb had observed that standalone May city elections drew only a couple thousand voters, whereas November general elections brought out a far larger and more diverse electorate ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=City%E2%80%99s%20election%20season%20from%20May,bigger%2C%20more%20inclusive%20group%20of)) ([Webb Talks F.C.

To him, local offices like City Council and School Board deserved to be decided by the broadest possible cross-section of residents, since those bodies directly affect citizens’ daily lives ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=the%20November%20elections%20we%20held,for%20the%20state%20and%20or)). Webb pressed the issue even though it was controversial in a tradition-bound community ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=I%20brought%20up%20this%20topic,willing%20to%20take%20this%20on)). In the end, City voters approved the switch in a 2010 referendum, moving Falls Church’s municipal elections to coincide with November national elections. The result was immediate: voter participation in city races increased, just as Webb had hoped ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=to%20voice%20their%20opinion%20at,willing%20to%20take%20this%20on)). He counts this timing change as one of his proudest accomplishments, as it opened the door for more citizens – including younger voters and newcomers – to have a voice in local governance ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=federal%20office%20during%20fall%20elections%2C,take%20part%20in%20municipal%20elections)) ([Webb Talks F.C.

Webb also served as a bridge between the City Council and the community’s youth during his term. Drawing on his professional background in education, he frequently engaged with student groups and supported youth-oriented initiatives. For example, Webb was involved in the launch of a **Youth Representatives** program that gave high school students a seat (in a non-voting advisory role) on city boards and commissions – fostering early civic involvement. He supported affordable housing in principle and other progressive causes, though fiscal realities sometimes forced him to make difficult votes. (When an ambitious affordable senior housing project proved financially untenable during the recession, Webb reluctantly provided a deciding vote against it, prioritizing the city’s solvency while voicing hope to revisit housing goals in better times ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=Webb%3A%20That%20was%20a%20very,was%20potentially%20going%20to%20cost)) ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=you%20that%20the%20money%20being,fund%20the%20school%20system%2C%20I%E2%80%99m)).) Throughout his council service, Webb balanced idealism with pragmatism. Colleagues described him as someone who brought positive energy and an inclusive mindset to City Hall, whether it was by listening to underrepresented voices or simply being, as he put it, a *“fresh, energetic face to move the city forward.”* ([Virginia's Historic Moment - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2008/05/virginias-historic-moment/#:~:text=administration%20at%20the%20University%20of,Mary%20Washington))

Webb ran for re-election in 2012, but in a crowded field he fell short of retaining his seat ([Lawrence Webb - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Webb#:~:text=Lawrence%20Webb%20is%20an%20academic,as%20chair%20of%20the%20board)). Still, his impact on the Council was significant. By the time he left City Hall, Falls Church had weathered the economic storm, made its elections more democratic, and set a tone of inclusion in civic affairs. Webb’s trailblazing role also didn’t end with his Council term – he would soon find another way to serve his adopted hometown.

## Advancing Education and Inclusion on the School Board
In 2013, Webb shifted his public service focus to the city’s acclaimed school system. That November, Falls Church voters elected him to the Falls Church City School Board, adding yet another historic credential to his résumé. (Years earlier, when Webb was president of his college student government, he had vowed to himself that he’d one day serve on a school board ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=But%20Webb%2C%20who%20moved%20from,into%20what%20it%20is%20today)) – a promise now fulfilled.) He began his School Board tenure in 2014 and was re-elected in 2017 ([Lawrence Webb ’97 - Alumni](https://www.su.edu/alumni/alumni-leadership/alumni-association/past-alumni-association-board-members/lawrence-webb-97/#:~:text=In%202013%2C%20Webb%20was%20elected,the%20local%20and%20state%20level)), serving on the board for seven years in total. His fellow board members twice selected Webb to chair the School Board, first for the 2017 term and again in 2018 ([Lawrence Webb - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Webb#:~:text=2012%20but%20lost.,as%20chair%20of%20the%20board)). In doing so, they tapped his leadership during pivotal moments for Falls Church schools.

As a School Board member, Webb worked to strengthen the bonds between the schools and the community, emphasizing transparency and inclusion. During his chairmanship, he held open forums with parent and community groups to candidly discuss school budget needs and facility plans ([Bio - Lawrence Webb for Falls Church School Board](http://webbforfallschurch.weebly.com/bio.html#:~:text=Lawrence%20Webb%20has%20served%20as,a%20new%20high%20school%20project)). This outreach helped **increase public confidence** in the Board during some high-stakes undertakings. Notably, Webb was instrumental in the push to finance and construct a brand-new high school for the city – a long-deferred project that finally gained approval during his tenure ([Bio - Lawrence Webb for Falls Church School Board](http://webbforfallschurch.weebly.com/bio.html#:~:text=2017,a%20new%20high%20school%20project)). He collaborated closely with the City Council to secure a referendum and funding for the new high school, which voters overwhelmingly supported. By the time Webb left the board, the state-of-the-art facility (now **Meridian High School**) was nearing completion, a source of pride for him and the community ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=As%20I%20prepare%20to%20step,needed%20upgrade%20to%20the%20community)).

Webb also emerged as a leading voice on issues of diversity and equity in education. In 2020, he and other board members confronted a sensitive topic: whether to rename the city’s two schools that bore the names of slave-owning Founding Fathers (George Mason High and Thomas Jefferson Elementary). Webb initially had reservations about undertaking the school name changes, knowing how divisive the debate could be ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=to%20have%20been%20selected%20twice,yet%20is%20very%20meaningful%20personally)). But as the only Black member of the School Board, he understood personally the importance of creating a school environment welcoming to all. Ultimately, Webb became a **prominent advocate** for the name changes ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=been%20in%20public%20office%20for,into%20what%20it%20is%20today)). Backed by student and parent input, the board voted in 2020 to remove the Mason and Jefferson names – a decision Webb found “very meaningful personally,” even if it was one of the toughest of his service ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=to%20have%20been%20selected%20twice,yet%20is%20very%20meaningful%20personally)). The following year, Falls Church’s schools proudly adopted new names untainted by the legacy of segregation, highlighting the city’s ongoing commitment to inclusion in which Webb had played a key part.

Outside the boardroom, Webb continued to support students directly. He and Clifton quietly organized an annual donation of backpacks filled with school supplies for local kids in need, making sure every student could start the school year prepared ([Bio - Lawrence Webb for Falls Church School Board](http://webbforfallschurch.weebly.com/bio.html#:~:text=Lawrence%20and%20his%20partner%20Clifton,for%20the%20past%20five%20years)). That hands-on community service endeared him to families and underscored his belief that every child deserves a chance to succeed. From budget debates to playground ribbon-cuttings, Webb approached school governance with the heart of an educator and the perspective of a community advocate. In 2014, the Virginia Leadership Institute (a nonprofit devoted to boosting Black political involvement) honored Webb as one of its “Top 40 Under 40” leaders, recognizing his years of service at both the local and state levels ([Lawrence Webb ’97 - Alumni](https://www.su.edu/alumni/alumni-leadership/alumni-association/past-alumni-association-board-members/lawrence-webb-97/#:~:text=reelected%20in%202017,the%20local%20and%20state%20level)). It was another affirmation that Webb’s inclusive leadership in Falls Church was noticed and appreciated beyond the city’s borders.

## Impact, Legacy and Continuing Advocacy
Lawrence Webb’s pioneering role in Falls Church government helped push the city toward a more inclusive civic identity – one that celebrates diversity and encourages participation from all quarters. Locally, Webb’s success showed that Falls Church’s values of **“community, education, and progress”** were more than just words: a young Black gay professional could not only belong, but lead, in the Little City. His presence in public office gave visibility to communities that had rarely been represented at City Hall or on the School Board. Longtime residents who once might never have imagined an openly gay official or a Black official in Falls Church found both embodied in Webb, and by most accounts the city was richer for it. *“I also hope my election opens the door for others,”* Webb said back in 2008 ([2008 - Explore a Year in LGBTQ History | Pride & Progress](https://www.prideandprogress.org/years/2008#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20hope%20my%20election%20opens,%E2%80%9D)) – and indeed, in the years since, other people of color and LGBTQ individuals in Northern Virginia have pointed to his example as an inspiration to run for office.

Webb’s influence is evident in the policies he championed. Voter turnout in Falls Church municipal elections surged after the switch to November voting ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=to%20voice%20their%20opinion%20at,willing%20to%20take%20this%20on)), bringing more voices into city decision-making. The new Meridian High School stands as a testament to forward-thinking investment in youth and the power of city-school collaboration – a project Webb helped shepherd from idea to reality ([Bio - Lawrence Webb for Falls Church School Board](http://webbforfallschurch.weebly.com/bio.html#:~:text=2017,a%20new%20high%20school%20project)). And the very names of the city’s schools now reflect the inclusive values that Webb and others worked to uphold ([Webb Talks F.C. Career, Name Change in Final Interview - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/01/01/webb-talks-f-c-career-name-change-in-final-interview/#:~:text=been%20in%20public%20office%20for,into%20what%20it%20is%20today)). Each of these accomplishments has left a lasting mark on Falls Church’s civic landscape.

In late 2020, Webb announced he would step down from the School Board and conclude his public service in Falls Church as he prepared to relocate out of the city ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=Clifton%20and%20I%20have%20fond,opening%20of%20the%20new%20facility)). His departure marked the end of 11 continuous years in elected office in Falls Church (four on Council and seven on the School Board) ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=THANK%20YOU%21%20It%20has%20been,City%20Council%20and%20School%20Board)) ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=My%20seven%20years%20on%20the,yet%20is%20very%20meaningful%20personally)). Webb and Clifton bid farewell to Falls Church – a community they had called home for over 15 years – with immense gratitude and “fond memories” of their time in the Little City ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=Clifton%20and%20I%20have%20fond,opening%20of%20the%20new%20facility)). *“It has been an honor to serve the residents of the City of Falls Church,”* Webb reflected, thanking the many friends and mentors who guided him along the way ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=By%20Lawrence%20Webb)) ([Guest Commentary: Webb Says Goodbye to Public Service in The Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/12/21/guest-commentary-webb-says-goodbye-to-public-service-in-the-little-city/#:~:text=I%20want%20to%20thank%20so,my%20sounding%20boards%20and%20mentors)). Although he no longer holds a local office, Webb has by no means retired from civic life. He remains active in public service on a broader stage: in 2017, Virginia’s governor appointed him to the state’s Advisory Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, seeking his expertise to help address issues of racial and social equity statewide ([Lawrence Webb ’97 - Alumni](https://www.su.edu/alumni/alumni-leadership/alumni-association/past-alumni-association-board-members/lawrence-webb-97/#:~:text=With%20his%20previous%20work%20on,to%20best%20address%20these%20many)). Webb has also continued his career in higher education administration, now helping recruit and guide the next generation of college students.

Today, Lawrence Webb continues to reside in northern Virginia and stays connected with the Falls Church community he helped transform. You might spot him back in town for an event at that new high school, or cheering on local students, or simply catching up with old neighbors at the farmers’ market. In Falls Church’s civic story, Webb’s chapter stands out: a barrier-breaking councilman and school board member who led with authenticity, championed inclusive policies, and proved that *everyone* has a place in the public life of “the Little City.” His legacy is one of a more open and representative Falls Church – a city that, thanks in part to Webb’s contributions, proudly lives up to its ideals of **unity in diversity**.
