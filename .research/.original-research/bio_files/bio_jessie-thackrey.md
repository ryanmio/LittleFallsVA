Widely regarded as a *“founder of the City of Falls Church”* and *“matriarch of the Falls Church City Public Schools,”* she devoted over five decades to public service ([F.C.

Her legacy includes helping Falls Church gain independence as a city in 1948, championing the creation of its own school system, and guiding that system through Virginia’s first voluntary school integration and the introduction of kindergarten ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%20served%20on%20the%20Falls,There%20were%20fewer%20stars%20on)). 

## Early Life and Arrival in Falls Church (1913–1940s)

Jessie Thackrey (née Jessie Dean) was born in 1913 and raised on a farm in Kansas ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=She%20was%20born%20Jessie%20Dean,make%20history%20of%20her%20own)). In 1941, she and her husband Franklin Thackrey moved with their young family to the Town of Falls Church, Virginia ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%E2%80%99s%20local%20civic%20accomplishments%20in,was%20getting%20from%20Fairfax%20County)). Coming from the Midwest, Jessie was surprised by the inadequate public services in Falls Church—unpaved roads, frequent water shortages, and *“aging, crowded”* school facilities ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%E2%80%99s%20local%20civic%20accomplishments%20in,was%20getting%20from%20Fairfax%20County)) ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=crowded%20schools%20were%20deteriorating,was%20getting%20from%20Fairfax%20County)). **“I came from Kansas and... our country school was really quite good. When we came here to Virginia, we expected everything to be that way and it wasn’t,”** she later recalled, noting that the local school didn’t even offer an 8th grade at the time ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20came%20from%20Kansas%20and,%E2%80%9D)). This stark contrast galvanized her and other civic-minded residents to push for major improvements in local government and education.

## Leading the Fight for an Independent Falls Church (1940s)

By the mid-1940s, Jessie and Franklin Thackrey had joined a group of reform-minded residents determined to take control of Falls Church’s future. At the time, Falls Church was still part of Fairfax County, and locals felt the county was neglecting their needs—especially the schools, which were *“under-funded”* under county governance ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=on%20August%2015%2C%201948,funded)). Jessie Thackrey later explained that the primary motivation for separating from Fairfax was *“the desire to have control over an independent school system”* ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=on%20August%2015%2C%201948,funded)). In 1948, after the town’s population surpassed 5,000 (a legal requirement), Falls Church won approval from the Virginia legislature to incorporate as an independent city ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=The%20civic,for%20more%20than%20two%20decades)). Franklin Thackrey served as chairman of the City Charter Committee, and Jessie was an active behind-the-scenes organizer. This political effort was hard-fought; she noted that *“Fairfax County tried awfully hard to make it unpleasant for us to leave”* ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=Thackrey%20soon%20became%20the%20PTA,a%20separate%20story%20and%20challenge)). In one tense episode, Fairfax officials even forced Falls Church’s school superintendent—injured with a broken leg—to stand in front of them during a meeting, a humiliation Jessie described as *“uncalled for”* during the cityhood struggle ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFairfax%20County%20tried%20awfully%20hard,us%20to%20leave%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said)). Despite such resistance, the Thackreys and their allies prevailed in establishing the City of Falls Church on August 15, 1948 ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=It%20was%20only%20six%20years,funded)).

### Building a New School System

One year later, in 1949, the newly independent city set up the Falls Church City Public Schools (FCCPS) as its own school division ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=The%20civic,for%20more%20than%20two%20decades)). Jessie Thackrey found her true calling in volunteer service to the fledgling school system. She and other parents worked feverishly to improve school conditions, often making do with limited resources. In the early years, classrooms were housed in scattered buildings—including private homes and an old farmhouse—because the city had no purpose-built schools ready ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=Thackrey%20and%20the%20others%20stuck,known%20as%20the%20Thompson%20House)) ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20Thackrey%20has%20witnessed,currently%20attending%20as%20a%20freshman)). (The City Council had passed a $700,000 bond in 1949 to construct two new school buildings, but those took time to complete ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=One%20year%20after%20becoming%20an,would%20go%20towards%20the%20schools)).) Thackrey later recounted how some school structures were so ramshackle *“they had to bring in bits of linoleum to keep the wind from blowing up through the floorboards”* ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=advanced%20schools%20near%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s,in%20which%20she%20found%20them)). Undaunted, she poured her energy into creating a better learning environment for the community’s children – including her own.

During the 1950s, Jessie Thackrey became one of Falls Church’s most influential civic volunteers, focusing especially on education and youth. Her involvement spanned numerous organizations and initiatives ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20Falls,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)):

- **Parent-Teacher Association:** She served as PTA president at a local school (Thomas Jefferson Elementary, and earlier the old Madison Elementary) to mobilize parents and improve local schools ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20Falls,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)) ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=Thackrey%20soon%20became%20the%20PTA,a%20separate%20story%20and%20challenge)).  
- **Aid for Students in Need:** As Chair of the United Givers Fund in Falls Church, she organized drives to provide school supplies, clothing, and shoes to low-income students ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20Falls,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)).  
- **Communications:** Thackrey edited several FCCPS newsletters for over two decades, keeping citizens informed and engaged in school issues ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20Falls,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)).  
- **Good Government Groups:** She was an active member of the League of Women Voters and a founding member of Citizens for a Better City (CBC) ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=supplies%2C%20clothing%20and%20shoes%20to,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)). Through these groups, she advocated for transparent, progressive city governance and robust public schools.  
- **Higher Education Leadership:** Beyond the city’s K-12 schools, Thackrey later served on the board of Northern Virginia Community College in the 1970s, even chairing the NVCC board in her final term ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20Falls,as%20Chair%20her%20final%20term)) – reflecting her commitment to education at all levels.

This grassroots leadership did not come without controversy. In the early 1950s, Falls Church’s push to fund modern schools stirred a backlash among some long-time residents. After the city invested heavily in new school facilities, a conservative faction accused school leaders of overspending. In 1951 they formed a so-called “Emergency Schools Committee” and succeeded in voting out the pro-education City Council ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20need%20for%20new,was%20voted%20out%20of%20office)). Six of seven school board members resigned under pressure, to be replaced by appointees more hostile to the school budget ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=office)). Though Jessie Thackrey held no official post in that period, she was firmly aligned with the pro-schools camp. She belonged to the “young turks” – many of them new, college-educated residents – who clashed with the old guard over the city’s direction ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=side%20was%20a%20new%20wave,and%20quite%20often%2C%20liberal%20politics)). Thackrey and her allies maintained that strong schools were vital to the young city, while opponents like local businessman George Strople argued the school spending was *“too high.”* ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Even%20before%20being%20chosen%20for,he%20felt%20was%20too%20high)) 

Strople in particular became a vocal antagonist to Thackrey’s vision. He would appear at nearly every public meeting to complain about school budgets ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Even%20before%20being%20chosen%20for,he%20felt%20was%20too%20high)). Thackrey, who lived nearby, recalled how Strople’s tirades were so long-winded that Falls Church eventually imposed a five-minute limit on public comments – a rule *“that survives to this day”* (now three minutes) ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Jessie%20Thackrey%2C%20a%20long,now%20standing%20at%20three%20minutes)). In 1959, when Strople (by then on the School Board) proposed cutting school nurse and psychologist positions, local students staged a prank in protest – erecting a mock tombstone on his lawn and burning “GM” (for George Mason High) into his grass ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Thackrey%20said%20that%20Strople%20was,letters%20%E2%80%9CGM%E2%80%9D%20into%20his%20yard)). Jessie and Franklin Thackrey tried to defuse the tensions as concerned neighbors. Strople wanted the teens harshly punished, but so many residents secretly found the prank *“funny”* that the matter ended with a simple student apology ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=part%20of%20the%20prank%20they,letters%20%E2%80%9CGM%E2%80%9D%20into%20his%20yard)). This episode captured the community’s division: on one side, reformers like the Thackreys fighting for better-funded, modern schools; on the other, traditionalists like Strople resisting those changes.

## School Board Tenure and Desegregation Leadership (1960s)

In 1962, Jessie Thackrey herself was appointed to the Falls Church City School Board, where she served two consecutive four-year terms (1962–1970) and was elected vice-chair for her second term ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%20served%20on%20the%20Falls,There%20were%20fewer%20stars%20on)). By the time she joined the board, the city was grappling with the mandate of **school desegregation**, the most explosive educational issue of the era. Falls Church, like the rest of Virginia, had operated racially segregated schools under Jim Crow. When the Supreme Court’s *Brown v. Board of Education* decision (1954) outlawed segregation, Virginia’s initial response was “Massive Resistance” – state policies designed to block integration by any means ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=greatest%20inequality%20still%20existed,that%20took%20over%20a%20decade)) ([Meeting John A.

From 1956 to 1959, local school boards had no control over integration; a state *Pupil Placement Board* decided student assignments to maintain segregation ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=That%20would%20prove%20to%20be,staked%20its%20resistance%20to%20integration)). Falls Church’s small African American student population (only a few dozen children) were barred from the all-white city schools and instead bused to segregated “colored” schools in Fairfax County, with the city paying their tuition ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=So%2C%20like%20the%20other%20school,totaled%20only%2030%20in%201955)). This practice persisted even after independence, partly because back in 1887 the town’s leaders had deliberately drawn the town boundaries to exclude the predominantly Black neighborhood known as the “colored settlement,” effectively keeping most Black families outside the city limits ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=The%20reason%20for%20the%20small,Caucasian%2C%20even%20to%20this%20day)). The result was that by the 1950s, Falls Church was a largely white enclave – a fact that eased some logistical aspects of integration but did not eliminate racial prejudices.

As Massive Resistance began to wane around 1960, Falls Church emerged as a leader in integrating schools. The city’s progressive bloc on the School Board – representing the values Thackrey championed – pushed to desegregate voluntarily, without waiting for a lawsuit or state orders. In February 1961 the board voted to reclaim control over student assignments from the state, the first step toward integration ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=integration)) ([M.E.

The Falls Church City Council gave its unanimous blessing as well ([M.E.

With local authority restored, Falls Church adopted a “freedom of choice” plan: Black families could apply to transfer their children into the formerly all-white city schools ([M.E.

That fall, on September 6, 1961, those three students walked into Falls Church classrooms – making FCCPS only the **second school district in Virginia** (and the first city system) to integrate its schools after *Brown* ([Meeting John A.

Falls Church had achieved desegregation voluntarily, avoiding the court battles and school closures that marked places like Prince Edward County and even nearby Arlington.

Jessie Thackrey took office on the School Board just as this integration became reality. She strongly supported the inclusion of African American students in Falls Church schools and remained vigilant against any attempts to reverse progress. Indeed, Strople continued to agitate even after Black students were admitted – at one point he tried to formally continue paying Fairfax County to educate Black pupils, which would have *“perpetuate[d]”* their exclusion from Falls Church schools. The board voted that ploy down 5–1 ([M.E.

Still, the process was not without community strife. Some white residents bitterly opposed sharing schools. Black students who enrolled endured hostility – one student, Marian Costner, recalled being the lone Black girl at George Mason High School and facing classmates who “hated” her for her skin color ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Right%20in%20the%20City%20of,and%20forget%20about%20equal%20rights)). Cross-burnings were reported in Falls Church as intimidation tactics, and civil rights picketers were harassed with thrown garbage ([M.E.

Thackrey and the School Board majority stood firm amidst these tensions, insisting that integrating the schools was both morally right and essential to the city’s identity. Years later, Jessie praised her colleague John Johnson – the early integration advocate who had preceded her on the board – saying *“we were lucky to have him”* fighting for equal education at a time when it was a lonely battle ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20were%20lucky%20to%20have,of%20cutting%20the%20school%20budget)). Under the leadership of figures like Johnson and Thackrey, Falls Church managed to integrate with comparatively “little bloodshed” (at least institutionally), setting an example in Virginia ([Meeting John A. Johnson: Unsung Hero In Falls Church’s 1950s Struggle to Integrate Its Schools - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/09/25/meeting-john-a-johnson-unsung-hero-in-falls-churchs-1950s-struggle-to-integrate-its-schools/#:~:text=This%20article%20tracks%20from%20the,black%20students%20into%20its%20classroom)). Jessie Thackrey would often cite **voluntary desegregation** as one of the proudest accomplishments of her public life ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%20served%20on%20the%20Falls,There%20were%20fewer%20stars%20on)).

Aside from desegregation, Thackrey and her colleagues pursued other forward-looking educational policies in the 1960s. Notably, Falls Church became the **first school system in Virginia to offer public Kindergarten** ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=Thackrey%20served%20on%20the%20Falls,There%20were%20fewer%20stars%20on)). At a time when most Virginia localities had no kindergarten at all (Fairfax County wouldn’t implement kindergarten until 1968 ([School History: Our Building | Beech Tree Elementary School](https://beechtreees.fcps.edu/about/history/our-building#:~:text=School%20History%3A%20Our%20Building%20,and%20nine%20new%20schools))), Falls Church introduced it for city children, reflecting Thackrey’s belief in early childhood education. Expanding special education and student support services was also a priority – for example, the board retained positions like school psychologists and nurses despite budget hawks’ objections ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Thackrey%20said%20that%20Strople%20was,letters%20%E2%80%9CGM%E2%80%9D%20into%20his%20yard)). Thackrey consistently advocated investing in quality teachers, innovative curriculum, and facilities to meet the needs of a growing student body. By the end of her School Board tenure in 1970, Falls Church’s small school system had earned a reputation for excellence and innovation far beyond its size. Thackrey remained engaged as an elder stateswoman of the schools, mentoring newer board members and championing initiatives like the International Baccalaureate program in later decades.

## Later Years, Legacy, and Remembrance

Jessie Thackrey’s influence in Falls Church extended well beyond the schoolhouse. In the 1970s, she broke another barrier by becoming the first **female senior warden** at The Falls Church Episcopal, her congregation since 1941 ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Jessie Thackrey](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/jessie-thackrey#:~:text=Voters)). She guided the historic church through leadership transitions, and even in her 90s lent her wisdom (and local historical knowledge) during a high-profile legal dispute that split the church in the 2000s ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=In%20the%201970s%2C%20Thackrey%20became,looking%20for%20a%20new%20rector)) ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=In%20the%202006%2C%20after%20the,the%20time%20and%20hadn%E2%80%99t%20quite)). Throughout her life she also remained active in civic groups and Democratic politics, always advocating for what she felt was the public good. In recognition of her service, Thackrey received numerous honors, including the **Carroll V. Shreve Award** in 1987 for humanitarian service to Falls Church and the **Mattie Gundry Award** in 1998 for outstanding community women ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Jessie Thackrey](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/jessie-thackrey#:~:text=In%201987%2C%20received%20the%20Carroll,Falls%20Church%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce)). In 2009, at age 95, she served as Grand Marshal of the Falls Church Memorial Day Parade – fittingly, in the 60th anniversary year of the city’s school system ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=Most%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C%20however%2C,of%20the%20founding%20of%20FCCPS)). The City’s communications director hailed her as *“the matriarch of the Falls Church school system”* and *“an important link to our earliest years”* ([28th Parade Grand Marshal Echoes FCCPS Anniversary - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/20/28th-parade-grand-marshal-echoes-fccps-anniversary/#:~:text=Communications%20Director%20for%20the%20city%E2%80%99s,fill%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20honorary%20position)).

When Jessie Thackrey passed away in September 2013 at the age of 100, tributes poured in celebrating her extraordinary legacy. **“It’s been great to be part of watching a city grow and the schools grow,”** she reflected shortly before her death, marveling at the progress made in Falls Church over her lifetime ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=In%20May%2C%20Thackrey%20reflected%20on,her%20legacy%20to%20her%20community)). Of all her achievements, she added, her greatest pride was in her six children – a humble reminder of how personally she viewed the fight for better schools ([F.C. Schools Pioneer Jessie Thackrey Dies At Age 100 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/09/28/f-c-schools-pioneer-jessie-thackrey-dies-at-age-100/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve%20had%20some%20sorrows%2C%20as,%E2%80%9D)). Today, Jessie Thackrey’s name and spirit live on in Falls Church. In 2014, the city opened a new early education center, the **Jessie Thackrey Preschool**, named in her honor ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Jessie Thackrey](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/jessie-thackrey#:~:text=Church%20community%20from%20the%20Falls,Church%20Commission%20on%20Women)). Fittingly, this school for the youngest learners embodies causes dear to Thackrey’s heart: it offers an inclusive, nurturing start for every child, echoing her lifelong commitment to educational opportunity. She is also remembered through the stories passed down in the community – from profiles on the Falls Church Women’s History Walk to the memories of former students and neighbors. Far from being forgotten or erased, Jessie Thackrey is revered as a local hero who helped shape “the Little City” with her vision, courage, and compassion. Her life’s work – from incorporating a city to integrating its classrooms – stands as a powerful example of citizen leadership in the pursuit of equality and excellence in public education.

Her impact continues to be felt in the civic and educational institutions that honor her name.
