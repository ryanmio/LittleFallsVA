# Robert Carter Sr. and Robert Carter III: Local Impact on Falls Church Area

## Robert Carter Sr. – Land Agent and Early Land Management (Falls Church Region)

**Role as Land Agent:** Robert “King” Carter (ca. 1664–1732) was the Virginia land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary owned by Lord Fairfax. In this capacity, Carter had legal authority over the granting and management of vast lands between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers – a region that included the area of present-day Falls Church ([Dictionary of Virginia Biography - Thomas, baron Fairfax of Cameron Fairfax (22 October 1693-9 December 1781) Biography](https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Fairfax_Thomas_baron_Fairfax_of_Cameron#:~:text=until%20years%20after%20his%20mother%27s,member%20of%20the%20governor%27s%20Council)). Lord Fairfax’s Northern Neck encompassed roughly 5.2 million acres, and Carter’s stewardship of these lands enabled him to acquire enormous wealth and property for himself. By the time of his death, Carter personally owned about 295,000 acres of Virginia land and hundreds of enslaved people, making him one of the wealthiest men in the colonies ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Robert%20Carter%20Ill%20was%20born,part%20of%20Carter%27s%20Leo%20Plantation)). This immense landholding earned him the nickname “King” Carter, and it directly resulted from his dual role as both agent and major beneficiary of Northern Neck land distribution ([Dictionary of Virginia Biography - Thomas, baron Fairfax of Cameron Fairfax (22 October 1693-9 December 1781) Biography](https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Fairfax_Thomas_baron_Fairfax_of_Cameron#:~:text=until%20years%20after%20his%20mother%27s,member%20of%20the%20governor%27s%20Council)).

**Land Grants and Local Settlement:** Carter’s approach to land management initially favored large grants, which had significant effects on early settlement around Falls Church. He himself noted as early as 1695 that the Northern Neck’s policies allowed speculators to hold tens of thousands of acres without settling them, since the proprietors’ deeds imposed no requirement to “seat” (occupy) or improve the land ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=land%20was%20granted%20inhibited%20the,grants%20were%20built%20or%20settled)). Carter complained that a man could securely hold “50,000 or more acres” without ever building on it, and such vast absentee ownership **inhibited development** of the area ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=land%20was%20granted%20inhibited%20the,grants%20were%20built%20or%20settled)). Indeed, in the late 1600s and early 1700s the Falls Church vicinity remained sparsely settled, largely because huge tracts were tied up by a few owners under the Northern Neck grants. Only when those great proprietary grants began to be subdivided and sold off did smaller farmers move in and a stable settlement pattern emerge (mostly in the mid-18th century) ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=on%20any%20part%20of%20it.%5C,which%20gave%20the%20house%20its)). Carter’s land policies, therefore, directly shaped the pace of early population growth in the Falls Church region.

**Local Land Holdings:** As Fairfax’s agent, Carter oversaw and signed off on land patents throughout Northern Virginia – and he also obtained prime tracts for himself. Notably, an 1728 Northern Neck patent in the western part of today’s Fairfax County was issued to Robert “King” Carter ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=74%20,Whites%20and%20both%20free%20and)). This indicates Carter held land in the Falls Church region or its immediate surroundings.  In fact, decades later that same patented land became the site of one of the area’s earliest churches outside the Anglican establishment: the Frying Pan Baptist Meetinghouse. A Baptist congregation that formed in 1775 was **granted permission by Carter’s family** to build a meeting house in 1783 on land originally patented to Carter Sr. in 1728 ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=leasing%20land%20from%20on%20a,The%20last%20surviving)). This continuity shows Carter’s long-lasting imprint on local landownership – his 18th-century grants were the foundation for later community institutions in Fairfax County.

**Economic Initiatives (Little Falls Warehouse):** Beyond paperwork and patents, Carter Sr. also took initiative in local economic development. Along with fellow Virginia magnate Thomas Lee, he **planned to establish a tobacco inspection warehouse at the Little Falls of the Potomac** (just east of Falls Church) as early as 1728 ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=powerful%20colonial%20landed%20gentlemen%2C%20Robert,as)). The Falls (Little Falls) area was a strategic point at the head of navigation on the Potomac, and a tobacco warehouse there would have facilitated trade for planters in the surrounding region. Although Carter and Lee’s proposed warehouse at Little Falls did not materialize immediately – it **was not actually built until 1742** ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=powerful%20colonial%20landed%20gentlemen%2C%20Robert,as)) – the plan itself underscores Carter’s interest and involvement in the Falls Church vicinity. He recognized the area’s importance for commerce. This effort also foreshadowed the later development of Alexandria (founded 1749 further downriver) and shows Carter’s hand in the early economic planning of Northern Virginia. 

**Summary of Local Impact:** In summary, Robert Carter Sr. exerted considerable influence over the Falls Church area through his **land management and authority**. As Lord Fairfax’s agent he controlled who received land and under what conditions, directly affecting settlement patterns around Falls Church ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=land%20was%20granted%20inhibited%20the,until%20well%20into%20the%20eighteenth)). He himself held land in the region (e.g. 1728 patent) and envisioned local infrastructure (like the Little Falls tobacco warehouse) to support the area’s growth ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=powerful%20colonial%20landed%20gentlemen%2C%20Robert,as)). Carter’s tenure set the stage for Fairfax County’s creation in 1742 and the subsequent development of communities such as Falls Church. His policies initially favored large landlords, but as those large tracts broke up, the Falls Church community began to take root on the very lands surveyed and granted under Carter’s authority.

## Robert Carter III – “The First Emancipator” in the Falls Church Vicinity

**Background and Property in Northern Virginia:** Robert Carter III (1728–1804) was the grandson of “King” Carter and inherited a substantial portion of the family’s vast estates. In 1732, when Robert III was still a small child, his father and grandfather died within months of each other, leaving him an enormous inheritance ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Robert%20Carter%20Ill%20was%20born,part%20of%20Carter%27s%20Leo%20Plantation)). Among the properties young Carter eventually controlled was the **Leo Plantation**, an 809-acre estate that sprawled across parts of **Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties** ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=So%20wrote%20Robert%20Carter%20III,American%20communities%20in%20Fairfax%20County)). Most of the land that today encompasses **Centreville and Manassas** in Northern Virginia was once part of Carter’s Leo Plantation ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Robert%20Carter%20Ill%20was%20born,part%20of%20Carter%27s%20Leo%20Plantation)). Thus, although Carter III’s primary residence was farther east at Nomini Hall in the Northern Neck, he was a major landowner in the broader Falls Church region. His Fairfax County lands placed him among the local gentry, and he would later engage with the community through religious and social actions.

**Religious Shift and Local Church Involvement:** In the early 1770s, Robert Carter III underwent a profound religious conversion – breaking from his Anglican upbringing and **embracing the Baptist faith**. This shift had tangible effects in Fairfax County. In **1775, Carter built a Baptist church in the Centreville area**, on the eastern part of his Leo Plantation, and opened it to everyone – **enslaved and free, Black and white** alike ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=faith,have%20been%20on%20park%20land)). This was a remarkable move in a time when the Anglican Church was still the established church in Virginia. Carter’s church (often referred to as the Baptist chapel at Cole’s Road, near modern Centreville) was one of the earliest Baptist meeting houses in Northern Virginia and signaled greater religious freedom in the community ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201770s%20Carter,have%20been%20on%20park%20land)). By inviting enslaved individuals to worship alongside free congregants, Carter III fostered an unusually integrated religious gathering for that era. His support for Baptist congregations extended beyond his own plantation as well. *For example:* a small Baptist group in the Frying Pan area (present-day Herndon) that had been **leasing land originally patented by his grandfather in 1728** sought Carter’s approval for a church. Carter III **granted permission in 1783 for them to erect the Frying Pan Baptist Meetinghouse** on that land ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=leasing%20land%20from%20on%20a,The%20last%20surviving)). The Frying Pan Meetinghouse’s membership in the late 18th century included a “fairly even balance” of white and Black worshippers (29 Black and 33 white members by 1840) ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=received%20permission%20from%20Robert%20Carter,The%20last%20surviving)) – a diversity that was possible in part because of Carter’s earlier decision to allow the meeting house. **In short, Robert Carter III actively nurtured religious and community institutions in Fairfax County** outside the traditional Anglican framework, leaving a legacy of greater inclusivity in worship.

**The 1791 “Deed of Gift” – Emancipation of Enslaved People:** Carter III is most famous for his bold emancipation of enslaved persons – an act that earned him the title **“the first emancipator”** in America. After years of contemplation and influenced by his Baptist convictions, he concluded that holding people in bondage was morally wrong. In August 1791 he executed a legal instrument known as the **Deed of Gift**, filed in Northumberland County, in which he **declared that slavery was “contrary to the true principles of Religion & justice” and that it was his duty to free his slaves** ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=Following%20his%20conversion%20into%20the,be%20manumitted%20when%20they%20reached)). This Deed of Gift outlined a gradual manumission process for **approximately 500–600 enslaved individuals** on Carter’s various estates ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=Unlike%20George%20Mason%2C%20Robert%20Carter,it%20was%20my%20duty%20to)) ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=in%20Northumberland%2C%20his%20county%20of,There%20they%20established%20the)). Beginning on January 1, 1792, Carter’s enslaved men and women were to be freed in rolling groups each year, starting with the oldest, and any children born were to be freed upon reaching adulthood ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=is%20contrary%20to%20the%20true,his%20Leo%20Farm%2C%20which%20spread)) ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=manumit,settled%20in%20the%20southwest%20corner)). Carter’s action was **unprecedented in scale**: by the early 1790s he had freed around 450 people, **the largest single private emancipation in U.S. history** up to that time ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=twentieth%20century%20with%20several%20historic,history%20%28Fairfax%20County)). This far surpassed other Virginia plantation owners’ manumissions (for comparison, even prominent figures like George Washington only provided for posthumous emancipation of far fewer individuals). Carter III’s Deed of Gift stands as a milestone in the history of emancipation, carried out decades before the Civil War.

**Local Impact of the Emancipation (Falls Church Area):** Importantly, Carter’s emancipation was not an abstract legal act – it had concrete effects on communities in Northern Virginia. A significant number of the people freed by the Deed of Gift came from Carter’s **Leo Plantation in Fairfax/Loudoun/Prince William**, and many chose to remain in the area as free citizens. **Forty-three men, women, and children formerly enslaved at Carter’s Leo farm settled in the southwestern corner of Fairfax County**, forming the core of a new free black community ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=adulthood%20%28Wolfe%202021%29.%20Forty,continued%20to%20thrive%20into%20the)). This settlement, known historically as the **Bull Run community** (also called “Gatepost” or “Hortontown”), thrived in the decades after emancipation ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=across%20portions%20of%20Fairfax%2C%20Loudoun%2C,Carter%E2%80%99s%20freeing%20of%20450)). By the early 19th century, families with surnames like Harris, Burke (descendants of Carter’s half-brother “Baptist Billy” whom he had freed ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Centreville%20and%20Manassas%20were%20part,of%20Carter%27s%20Leo%20Plantation)) ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Carter%20provided%20land%20and%20supplies,in%201854%20with%20his%20parents))), Payne, and others established farms between Bull Run and Cub Run, just south of Centreville ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=on%20his%20twelve%20farms%2C%20including,American%20communities%20in%20Fairfax%20County)). They built homes, and by 1854 they founded the **Cub Run Primitive Baptist Church** to serve their growing community ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=grown%20to%2052,at%20Manassas%20National%20Battlefield%20Park)). Many of these free families prospered: for instance, within a generation the Harris family owned over 570 acres of land in that area ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=Nathaniel%20Harris%2C%20Uriah%20Amager%20and,corn%2C%20and%20supporting%20local%20merchant)). Historical accounts note that **Carter actively supported his freed people** in their transition – he **provided land, tools, and supplies** to help them become self-sufficient ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Carter%20provided%20land%20and%20supplies,in%201854%20with%20his%20parents)). This generosity contributed to the success of families like that of Baptist Billy (William Burke), whose descendants remained free and even migrated to free states (his great-grandson Nimrod Burke moved to Ohio in 1854) ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=Carter%20provided%20land%20and%20supplies,in%201854%20with%20his%20parents)). The Bull Run community founded by Carter’s emancipated slaves endured well into the 19th and 20th centuries, representing one of Fairfax County’s earliest and largest African American settlements ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=emancipated%20from%20Leo%20farm%20would,American%20communities%20in%20Fairfax%20County)) ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=across%20portions%20of%20Fairfax%2C%20Loudoun%2C,Carter%E2%80%99s%20freeing%20of%20450)). Thus, Carter III’s emancipation had a **direct local legacy**: it transformed the social landscape of Northern Virginia by creating a lasting free community within Fairfax County, roughly 20 miles from Falls Church.

**Relationships with Early Institutions:** Robert Carter III’s influence in the Falls Church vicinity can also be seen in how his actions intersected with early institutions. While **The Falls Church (Episcopal)** itself – the 1730s Anglican parish church for which the town is named – was primarily supported by other gentry (like the Washingtons and Masons), Carter’s impact was felt in the **emergence of alternative institutions**. His 1775 Centreville Baptist church and the 1780s Frying Pan meetinghouse introduced non-Anglican religious centers in Fairfax, broadening the religious landscape ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201770s%20Carter,have%20been%20on%20park%20land)) ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=leasing%20land%20from%20on%20a,The%20last%20surviving)). And through the community of freed people he enabled, Carter indirectly fostered new social institutions: the free black community at Bull Run built its own church (Cub Run Primitive Baptist) by 1850s and later a school, becoming an early center of African American life in the county ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=grown%20to%2052,at%20Manassas%20National%20Battlefield%20Park)) ([A Little-known African American Community at Bull Run | Our Stories and Perspectives](https://ourstoriesandperspectives.com/2021/02/28/a-little-known-african-american-community-at-bull-run/#:~:text=Armies%20repeatedly%20destroyed%20property%20and,detail%2C%20Library%20of%20Congress)). In short, Carter III’s legacy in the area is visible not through his holding public office or parish positions, but through the **communities and churches that grew out of his unprecedented emancipations and his support for religious freedom**.

**Conclusion:** Both Robert Carter Sr. and Robert Carter III played significant roles in the history of the Falls Church area, albeit in very different ways. **Robert Carter Sr.** wielded authority over land – shaping who owned the ground on which Falls Church and surrounding communities would rise. As Lord Fairfax’s agent, he controlled early land grants (often in huge swaths) ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=land%20was%20granted%20inhibited%20the,until%20well%20into%20the%20eighteenth)), and his own investments (like the proposed Little Falls warehouse) show his hand in the area’s early economic life ([little_falls_research.json](file://file-ENsVHrMEqNg4ZDafNkx32t#:~:text=powerful%20colonial%20landed%20gentlemen%2C%20Robert,as)). **Robert Carter III**, inheriting that mantle of landownership, used his position to advance a moral and social agenda unusual for his time: he established new religious gathering places open to all races ([Park History Interpretive Series: Robert Carter III and His Deed of Gift | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/bull-run-regional-park/things-to-do/park-history-interpretive-series-robert-carter-iii-and#:~:text=faith,have%20been%20on%20park%20land)) and freed hundreds of enslaved laborers, seeding a free community in Fairfax County ([](https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FX-857_Fairfax_County_AfricanAmerican_Historic_Resources_Survey_2022_HPC-WMCAR_report_Web_Version.pdf#:~:text=adulthood%20%28Wolfe%202021%29.%20Forty,build%02ings%2C%20though%20later%20infill%20has)). His title as “the first emancipator” is well-earned, and its effects were felt in the very neighborhoods around Falls Church. Together, the two Carters left a layered legacy – from the platting of colonial land parcels to the liberation of families – that is part of early Falls Church area history.
