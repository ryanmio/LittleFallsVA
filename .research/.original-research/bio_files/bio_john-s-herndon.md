# Mayor John S. Herndon (Falls Church Mayor in the 1910s)

## Background and Political Rise

John S. Herndon served as mayor of Falls Church, Virginia during the mid-1910s. By November 1914, Mayor Herndon was already entrenched in local politics and espousing the era's prevailing white supremacist views. At a town council meeting on November 9, 1914, Herndon warned that "a Negro had rented or was about to rent property at West Falls Church" and urged the council to adopt a residential segregation ordinance. This initiative did not emerge in a vacuum – it was enabled by a 1912 Virginia law allowing cities and towns to create segregated districts, justified under the guise of protecting "public morals, public health and public order" by separating the races. Herndon quickly became the leading proponent of a Falls Church segregation law, reflecting a platform of overt racial exclusion. He framed the ordinance as necessary for the community's welfare, aligning with the racist rhetoric common in Virginia politics of that period.

## 1915 Residential Segregation Ordinance

In January 1915, under Herndon's leadership, the Falls Church Town Council formally adopted an ordinance to segregate housing by race. The ordinance empowered a Committee on Segregation to draw a map dividing the town into "white" and "colored" residential sections. Once in effect, it would be illegal for individuals to sell or rent homes to Black people in white-designated areas. Black residents already living in "white" zones could stay, but no new Black residents could move there. Violators faced steep fines (up to $50 in the first week and $2 per day thereafter). Herndon and supporters touted this as a legal means to enforce de facto segregation. Indeed, Falls Church was following the lead of other Southern communities – empowered by state law – to codify segregation in housing. Herndon defended the measure as protecting property values and social order, echoing the racist logic of the day. At a special town voter referendum on May 25, 1915, a majority of Falls Church's (white) electorate expressed approval of establishing these segregated districts, indicating that Herndon's views had substantial local support among white citizens. The approved plan would have forced the town's Black population (about 32% of residents) into a cramped 5% of the town's land.

## White Supremacist Context in Falls Church

Mayor Herndon's push for segregation was part of a broader pattern of white supremacist politics in Falls Church and the region. As far back as 1890, Falls Church's town council had maneuvered to reduce Black political power by ceding a predominantly African American neighborhood (Tinner Hill and surrounding area) back to Fairfax County, shrinking the town's size by 20%. This 1890 retrocession was motivated by fear that Black voters might otherwise dominate local elections. By the 1910s, white nativist sentiment was on the rise nationwide – **The Birth of a Nation** had premiered in 1915, fueling KKK revival – and Falls Church was no exception. The Ku Klux Klan was active in the Falls Church area at this time; residents later recounted KKK cross burnings in town, including one near the home of prominent Black educator E.B. Henderson on South Maple Avenue. Herndon's segregation ordinance thus rode a wave of Jim Crow fervor. It was explicitly designed to maintain white dominance by segregating neighborhoods and was backed by pseudo-scientific and moral arguments common to Jim Crow laws. In proposing the law, Herndon and his allies claimed it was vital for the "public morals" and safety of the community. In reality, the ordinance was about entrenching racial hierarchy. The local press and white civic groups largely either supported Herndon or remained silent, reflecting how ingrained these ideas were. Falls Church's move to segregate housing in 1915 mirrored efforts in cities like Richmond, Norfolk, and others, and it occurred just before Virginia and other Southern states began enacting racially restrictive zoning and covenants as well.

## Opposition and Community Reaction

While many white citizens approved of Herndon's policy, Falls Church's Black community mobilized fierce resistance. In January 1915 – literally within days of the ordinance's passage – Dr. Edwin Bancroft "E.B." Henderson and Joseph Tinner organized a meeting of Black residents to form the **Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL)**. This was a direct response to Herndon's law. The CCPL, led by Tinner (a local stonemason) as president and E.B. Henderson (a school principal and civil rights advocate) as secretary, immediately protested the ordinance. On January 11, 1915, a delegation of Black citizens presented formal objections to the Falls Church Town Council, arguing the segregation law violated their rights under the 14th Amendment. Herndon and the council majority brushed off these objections and even strengthened the ordinance, passing a more robust version by a 4–1 vote (Councilman W.A. Harmon was the lone dissenter). In response, the CCPL launched a letter-writing campaign to sway local opinion – sending letters to council members, churches, and white business owners imploring them to oppose the segregation plan. They also raised funds to hire legal counsel. In June 1915, after the council officially mapped the town's "white" and "colored" sections, the CCPL filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County Circuit Court seeking an injunction against enforcement. This legal challenge effectively stalled the ordinance. Importantly, Dr. E.B. Henderson also reached out beyond Falls Church: he wrote to W.E.B. Du Bois and the national NAACP, seeking support. Although the NAACP home office was initially hesitant to establish a branch in such a small, volatile Southern town, the groundwork was laid for broader civil rights involvement. Herndon suddenly found himself facing organized, principled opposition that garnered regional attention. By raising constitutional issues, Black Falls Church residents put Herndon's council on the defensive. In October 1915, a Fairfax judge indeed issued a rule requiring the town to justify the law, and Falls Church had to hire its own attorney to defend the ordinance. This was a remarkable pushback in an era when few Black communities had the resources to mount legal fights.

## Aftermath – Legal Defeat of the Ordinance

Mayor Herndon's crusade ultimately failed. Due to the CCPL's lawsuit, the residential segregation ordinance never went into effect as planned on January 1, 1916. The case's resolution was influenced by events beyond Falls Church. While Falls Church's ordinance was tied up in court, a similar segregation law from Louisville, Kentucky was challenged in the case **Buchanan v. Warley**. In November 1917, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in *Buchanan v. Warley*, striking down municipal racial segregation ordinances as unconstitutional violations of the 14th Amendment. This federal ruling nullified laws like Falls Church's across the country. Even before *Buchanan*, Virginia's Supreme Court had signaled skepticism of these ordinances. In Falls Church, the town council quietly acknowledged by late 1915 that the courts had effectively overridden their authority to segregate the community. Herndon himself did not see the ordinance through – he **abruptly resigned as mayor on May 8, 1916**, with no official reason recorded. It's not clear if public pressure, personal issues, or disillusionment prompted his resignation, but it coincided with the ordinance's stagnation. After Herndon's departure, Falls Church printed the segregation districts in its town code in late 1916, but enforcement was a dead letter. By 1918, the CCPL had evolved into the Falls Church and Vicinity branch of the NAACP – **the nation's first rural NAACP branch** – which continued fighting racial discrimination in Northern Virginia. Falls Church's ordinance was formally nullified by the courts, yet tellingly, it **remained on the town's books for decades** (albeit unenforced). In fact, when Falls Church transitioned from a town to an independent city in 1948, the segregation law was simply omitted from the new city code rather than explicitly repealed. It was not until *1999* that the City of Falls Church Council officially repealed and renounced the 1915 ordinance as morally repugnant. Herndon's signature law had lingered like a shadow until modern leaders condemned it.

## Legacy and Modern Interpretation

Mayor John S. Herndon stands as a local symbol of institutionalized racism in Falls Church's history. His advocacy of the segregation ordinance illustrates how white supremacy was not just a fringe sentiment but a guiding principle in the town's early 20th-century governance. Modern Falls Church has taken steps to reckon with this legacy. In 1999, the city council unanimously **denounced and repudiated** the 1915 ordinance and issued a public apology for it. The episode has spurred public history efforts – such as the Tinner Hill Historic Site and local civil rights markers – to educate residents about the brave resistance of Black citizens like Henderson and Tinner against Herndon's racist policy. Contemporary historians emphasize that Herndon's actions, while commonplace in the Jim Crow South, had lasting harmful impacts: they emboldened racist attitudes and set the stage for later discriminatory practices (like racially restrictive covenants in Falls Church real estate well into the mid-20th century). From a modern perspective, Herndon's tenure is a cautionary tale of how local government was complicit in systemic racism. Understanding his role has become part of Falls Church's ongoing conversation about racial equity. Rather than erase this painful history, the city now confronts it openly – for example, City Council resolutions in recent years have acknowledged the town's segregationist past when considering historic district designations for sites like Tinner Hill. In sum, John S. Herndon's legacy is inseparable from the 1915 segregation ordinance. While once lauded by segregationists, today his name is largely remembered in opprobrium, serving as a reminder of how far Falls Church has come and how important it is to continue addressing the legacy of systemic racism. His story is a pivotal chapter in the city's journey from exclusion to inclusion – illustrating both the depths of local white supremacist politics and the community's eventual efforts to overcome them.
