# Mary Riley Styles: Library Pioneer and Civic Leader 

## Life and Family Background

Mary Riley Styles (1869â€“1946) was born and raised at the historic Cherry Hill Farm in Falls Church, a property that would remain her lifelong home. As a member of one of Falls Church's prominent white families, she grew up with the privileges of her social position in a segregated Virginia. She married Samuel R. Styles, who would later become a Town Council member and key proponent of Falls Church's 1915 residential segregation ordinance. While her husband worked to formalize racial separation in housing, Mary channeled her energies primarily into civic and cultural development, particularly through women's organizations and library work.

## Library Leadership and Women's Clubwork

In the early 1900s, Falls Church had only a small private lending library, initially established by the Village Improvement Society in 1899. Mary Styles stepped up to ensure that this nascent institution not only survived but flourished. Around 1915 - notably, the same year her husband was advancing segregationist policies - she became chairwoman of the Falls Church Library Committee, a position she would hold with distinction for over 25 years.

Under her dedicated leadership and backed by the volunteer labor of the Falls Church Woman's Club, the library's collection was maintained through world wars, financial hardships, and multiple relocations. From 1913 until the late 1930s, the library was sustained entirely by unpaid women volunteers like Styles, reflecting both the gendered nature of cultural work in that era and the real civic power women wielded through these "acceptable" channels. She not only oversaw operations but also personally donated funds and books to grow the collection.

A 1945 resolution by the Woman's Club credited Mary Riley Styles's "dedication, spirit, and moral and financial support" as directly responsible for the library's continued existence and expansion. Her civic work exemplified the Progressive Era clubwoman's approach to community building - using traditionally feminine skills of organization, education, and nurturing to create public institutions, even as formal political power remained largely in male hands.

## Legacy and Commemoration

Upon her death in 1946, Mary's children honored her wish to benefit the city by donating a portion of the family's Cherry Hill Farm for a permanent library building. This made Falls Church the first community in Northern Virginia to plan a building solely for a public library. The facility opened in 1958, and in 1977 it was formally renamed the Mary Riley Styles Public Library, ensuring that her contributions would remain part of the city's living memory.

## Contextualizing Mary Riley Styles: Women's Rights and Racial Politics

Mary Riley Styles' work must be understood within the complex intersection of gender and racial politics of her time. Like many white women of her generation and social position, she found agency through women's organizations at a time when formal political power was limited for women. The library committee and women's club work provided avenues for civic leadership outside the male-dominated political sphere.

However, it is important to note that even as she championed education and cultural access, she operated within - and likely accepted - the racial boundaries of Jim Crow Virginia. There is no evidence that Mary publicly opposed the segregation ordinance her husband championed in 1915. The library she helped build, like most Southern institutions of that era, was almost certainly segregated or inaccessible to Black residents for much of its early history, despite being funded by tax dollars from all citizens.

This juxtaposition - between her progressive work for literacy and education and her apparent acceptance of racial hierarchy - reflects the complicated reality of early 20th century reform movements. Many white women who advocated for expanded rights and opportunities for their gender simultaneously overlooked or even endorsed the denial of those same rights to people of color.

## A More Complete Historical Picture

Today, Falls Church celebrates Mary Riley Styles as a civic pioneer while also beginning to reckon with her husband Samuel's role in attempting to enforce residential segregation. The contrast between the couple - she building institutions that theoretically served the public good, he working to restrict the rights and movements of Black citizens - highlights how closely intertwined progress and oppression could be in early 20th century America.

The Mary Riley Styles Public Library, now serving a diverse community, stands both as a testament to her dedication to education and as a reminder of how institutions created in a segregated era have evolved. A more complete historical understanding acknowledges both her genuine civic contributions and the privileged, racially stratified context in which she made them - neither dismissing her work nor separating it from the broader social realities of her time.
