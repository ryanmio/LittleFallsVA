# Mattie Gundry: Pioneering Falls Church Educator Who Broke Barriers in Segregated Times

Mattie Gundry (1861–1947) was a trailblazing educator and civic leader in Falls Church, Virginia whose career spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She founded a nationally renowned school, fought for women’s inclusion in educational governance, and championed equality in an era when public institutions — including schools — were segregated by both law and custom. Gundry’s work to improve education for **all** children, including those often neglected, helped lay groundwork that influenced Falls Church’s gradual path away from exclusionary practices ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20was%20a%20force,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Pioneering%20Educator%20%26%20Civic%20Leader)).

## Early Life and a Vision for Education

Originally from Ohio, “Miss Mattie” Gundry moved to Falls Church in 1893 with a passion for teaching and social reform ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Pioneering%20Educator%20%26%20Civic%20Leader)). In 1899, she purchased an 11-acre property off West Broad Street and established the **Virginia Training School**, one of the first institutions in the South for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20was%20a%20force,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)). At a time when such students were often ignored or kept at home, Gundry’s school offered practical skills and education to help enrich their lives ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=electricity%20arriving%20in%201898,Church%20Library%20Association%20was%20created)). It was *the only school for children with disabilities in the South* and later became the second-largest of its kind in the entire United States ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=1899,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)) ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=the%20only%20school%20for%20children,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)). Gundry served as principal of the school for nearly 50 years until her death in 1947, earning recognition as a respected national leader in special education ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Pioneering%20Educator%20%26%20Civic%20Leader)) ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20was%20a%20force,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)). 

This pioneering institute — located at what is now the Winter Hill neighborhood — made Falls Church a regional beacon for progressive education. Locals recalled the old Schuyler Duryee house (the school’s main building) outfitted with large exterior fire escapes for the “mentally-handicapped inmates,” an innovative safety feature for the era ([

Gundry’s compassionate approach stood in contrast to the neglect or harsh institutionalization that many disabled children faced elsewhere. **By proving that children with special needs could learn and thrive**, she quietly challenged assumptions of who deserved public education.

## Fighting for a Voice in Public Schools

Beyond her own school, Gundry sought to improve **public** education in Falls Church. In the early 1900s — when Virginia’s schools were strictly segregated by race and women had virtually no role in public life — Gundry pushed against the barriers. In 1908, the Falls Church Town Council appointed her as a public school trustee, making her the *first woman in Virginia* to serve in such a capacity ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Elected%20by%20the%20Falls%20Church,and%20was%20ineligible%20to%20vote)). Her appointment was brief, however. The Fairfax County superintendent and a county court swiftly declared Gundry ineligible **solely because she was a woman and not a registered voter** (women could not vote at the time) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Elected%20by%20the%20Falls%20Church,and%20was%20ineligible%20to%20vote)). It was a stinging reminder of the era’s bias: despite local leaders’ confidence in her abilities, the law barred women from holding office. 

Undeterred, Gundry turned her disappointment into activism. In 1912, Falls Church residents overwhelmingly **elected** her to the school board in a local vote, signaling public support for her service ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Sometime%20around%201912%2C%20Mattie%20was,America%2C%20from%201776%20until%201920)). Yet once again she was prevented from taking her seat due to Virginia’s law limiting office-holding to registered (male) voters ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Sometime%20around%201912%2C%20Mattie%20was,America%2C%20from%201776%20until%201920)). Frustrated by this injustice, Gundry helped form the Women’s Suffrage League of Fairfax County in 1913 and emerged as a vocal advocate for women’s voting rights ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=woman%20and%20was%20ineligible%20to,vote)). **She understood that without the vote, women could not fully shape policies for schools or anything else.** Gundry campaigned vigorously until the 19th Amendment was finally ratified in 1920, enfranchising women ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=woman%20and%20was%20ineligible%20to,vote)). 

With voting rights secured, Gundry herself blazed another trail. In 1921 she won election to the Falls Church Town Council, becoming one of the first two women ever to sit on that governing body ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=in%201920)). She would go on to serve three consecutive terms on the Town Council ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=in%201920)). Through the 1920s, she used her influence in local government to advocate for civic improvements — including better schools. Falls Church was still part of rural Fairfax County then, but it was growing. Under Gundry’s leadership and that of her colleagues, the town in 1924 secured permission to form its **own school district** separate from county control ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=Between%20WWI%20and%20WWII%2C%20Falls,the%20town%20started%20a%20very)) ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cbedroom%E2%80%9D%20community%20of%20subdivisions%20for,Jefferson%20Institute%20became%20a%204)). This allowed Falls Church to direct more attention and resources to its schools. Within two years, a new elementary school (Madison School, for grades 1–7) had opened, and the existing Jefferson Institute was expanded into a four-year high school for local students ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cbedroom%E2%80%9D%20community%20of%20subdivisions%20for,When%20%E2%80%9Ctalky%E2%80%9D)). These steps modernized education in Falls Church – albeit **within the segregated school system of that era**, which provided separate facilities for White and Black students.

## Navigating a Segregated School System

During Gundry’s lifetime, Virginia’s public schools were segregated by law. Falls Church was no exception: White children attended the Jefferson Institute and other town schools, while African-American children were taught at a small “Falls Church Colored School” on Annandale Road through seventh grade ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Lola Saunders](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/lola-saunders#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20native%20and%20long,Colored%20School%20on%20Annadale%20Road)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Lola Saunders](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/lola-saunders#:~:text=During%20this%20period%20of%20segregated,the%20city%20after%207th%20grade)). After seventh grade, Black students had to leave Falls Church to pursue an education — often traveling to the nearest Black high schools in Washington or elsewhere, since none existed locally at first ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Lola Saunders](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/lola-saunders#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20native%20and%20long,Colored%20School%20on%20Annadale%20Road)). Gundry operated within this unjust system, focusing her educational mission on students with disabilities and on improving schooling generally. There’s no record of her overtly challenging racial segregation in schools; such a stance would have been politically risky (and likely futile) in early 20th-century Virginia. However, **her overall philosophy was one of inclusion and equal opportunity**. As a Town Council member, she at least ensured that *all* local children had a school to go to – for example, the segregated Black school itself was constructed around the mid-1910s as the town’s response to African-American residents’ pleas for education beyond what White institutions would allow ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=NAACP%20in%20the%20nation,In%201917%2C%20the%20United%20States)) ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=Suffrage%20movement%20and%20winning%20voting,where%20she%20served%20three%20terms)). (Notably, her contemporary Dr. Edwin B. Henderson and his wife Mary Ellen Henderson spearheaded that fight, forming the first rural NAACP branch to protest unequal schooling, which Gundry’s Town Council eventually yielded to by establishing the separate school ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=NAACP%20in%20the%20nation,In%201917%2C%20the%20United%20States)).) 

Gundry’s own contributions to *de facto* desegregation were indirect but meaningful. She **broadened the definition of “public education”** to include those whom the mainstream system separated or excluded — be it by race, gender, or ability. By educating disabled children (regardless of social class) and by fighting for women’s roles in school leadership, Gundry was chipping away at the walls of exclusion. Her work fostered a spirit of progress and empathy in the community. Later generations of Falls Church reformers – including those who would successfully integrate the city’s schools in the 1960s – built on that foundation of inclusivity. “The Tinner and Henderson families were instrumental in shaping the Falls Church we know today, including their efforts to desegregate our schools,” one historical account notes ([Finalists Picked To Replace George Mason HS, TJ Elementary School | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/finalists-picked-replace-george-mason-hs-tj-elementary-school#:~:text=,combine%20city%20history%20and%20diversity)) ([Finalists Picked To Replace George Mason HS, TJ Elementary School | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/finalists-picked-replace-george-mason-hs-tj-elementary-school#:~:text=Among%20the%20five%20finalists%2C%20Tinner,People%20in%20the%20United%20States)). Gundry, an earlier generation’s reformer, helped shape a city culture that valued education for *every* child and the civic participation of the disenfranchised.

## Civic Leadership and Community Influence

Outside the classroom, Gundry was deeply involved in civic life. She was a **founding director of the Falls Church Bank in 1906**, the first (and for years only) woman to serve on its board of directors ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Became%20one%20of%20the%20first,1921%20and%20served%20three%20terms)). She also held longtime leadership roles in the Village Improvement Society (VIS) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Helped%20establish%20the%20Falls%20Church,for%20the%20next%2037%20years)), a civic group dedicated to modernizing and beautifying Falls Church. (The VIS established the town’s first library in 1899 — the same year Gundry founded her school ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=electricity%20arriving%20in%201898,Church%20Library%20Association%20was%20created)).) Through these roles, Gundry promoted education in a broad sense, from literacy to public health and infrastructure.

Her most prominent civic cause was **women’s empowerment**. As noted, she co-led the local suffrage league and, after women gained the vote, chaired committees to advance women’s involvement in public affairs ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Edith Abramson](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/edith-abramson#:~:text=1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Edith Abramson](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/edith-abramson#:~:text=first%20chair)). In fact, Gundry later helped create the Falls Church Commission on Women, an official advisory body, and was so revered that the Commission named a major honor after her decades later ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Edith Abramson](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/edith-abramson#:~:text=Chair%20of%20the%20City%20Council,she%20became%20the%20first%20chair)). *“Mattie Gundry is a local hero, a determined advocate for equal rights, justice, and compassion for the less fortunate among us,”* wrote Falls Church Vice Mayor Marybeth Connelly, praising Gundry’s example of leadership ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20is%20a%20local,Mattie%20Gundry%20and%20her%20peers)). Gundry’s ability to work across different spheres — education, government, banking, and civic clubs — made her one of Falls Church’s most influential figures in the early-mid 20th century.

## Praise and Pushback in Her Time

Throughout her career, Gundry won admiration from many in the community. Parents of her students credited her with transforming young lives. Neighbors saw the Virginia Training School as a point of pride for the town. Voters clearly trusted her, electing her to public office repeatedly once they legally could ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Sometime%20around%201912%2C%20Mattie%20was,America%2C%20from%201776%20until%201920)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=in%201920)). Local newspapers and records from the 1910s–1920s highlighted her “effective and compassionate” teaching and her reputation as *“a force to be reckoned with”* in Falls Church ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Have%20you%20ever%20walked%20down,here%20in%20the%20Little%20City)) ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20was%20a%20force,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)).

Yet Gundry also faced opposition, especially from those clinging to the status quo. Her very first appointment to the school board in 1908 was nullified by officials who could not countenance a woman in authority ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Elected%20by%20the%20Falls%20Church,and%20was%20ineligible%20to%20vote)). Similarly, state authorities refused to recognize her 1912 school board election victory ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Sometime%20around%201912%2C%20Mattie%20was,America%2C%20from%201776%20until%201920)). These setbacks, however, only fueled her resolve. Gundry’s polite but firm defiance – she simply went out and organized for women’s rights – earned her respect even beyond Falls Church. By the 1920s, as she took her seat on the Town Council, the tide had turned and she was viewed as a pioneer.

Within the segregated framework of the day, Gundry’s push for any kind of equality sometimes drew quiet criticism as too progressive. There is no direct evidence of how White supremacists of that era regarded Gundry, but given that the local Ku Klux Klan targeted civil-rights leaders like the Hendersons, it’s likely Gundry’s outspoken advocacy for *women* and *disabled children* raised some eyebrows. Still, she avoided the most intense backlash by largely staying within acceptable bounds (for instance, improving Black education **within** the separate system, rather than calling for integration outright).

## A Complicated Legacy: Honors and Re-Evaluation

Mattie Gundry’s legacy in Falls Church is significant — and somewhat complicated. On one hand, the city has remembered and honored her as a visionary educator and barrier-breaker. A street in Falls Church, **Gundry Drive**, is named for her, a daily reminder of her presence in the city’s history ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Have%20you%20ever%20walked%20down,here%20in%20the%20Little%20City)). The Falls Church Commission for Women established the **Mattie Gundry Award** in the 1990s, which each year recognizes a woman who has made outstanding contributions to equality and community improvement ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Edith Abramson](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/edith-abramson#:~:text=first%20chair)). (Recipients have included civic leaders like educator Jessie Thackrey and Mayor Carol DeLong.) A state historic marker on West Broad Street commemorates the Virginia Training School and Gundry’s role in its founding ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=town%20just%20off%20West%20Broad,learn%20more%20about%20the%20school)). And each year during Women’s History Month, Gundry’s story is featured on the Falls Church Women’s History Walk as an example of pioneering leadership ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=Pioneering%20Educator%20%26%20Civic%20Leader)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Mattie Gundry](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/mattie-gundry#:~:text=in%201920)).

However, as modern scholars and citizens take a closer look, **some aspects of Gundry’s record have come under scrutiny**. In 2021, when a school renaming committee proposed “Mattie Gundry Elementary School” as a new name for a local elementary school, a debate erupted over Gundry’s views. Research revealed that in the early 1900s Gundry had been involved in the era’s eugenics movement — a then-mainstream but now-discredited effort to segregate and prevent the reproduction of people deemed “unfit.” Gundry served on a national “Committee on Colonies for Segregation of Defectives” and **helped author a 1915 report** calling for the **“permanent segregation” of so-called “degenerates”** ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=However%2C%20with%20little%20effort%2C%20I,and%20that%20they%20shall%20not)). The report she signed advocated that government-run colonies should isolate those with hereditary “defective” conditions — listing not just the “chronic insane” but also *“the epileptic, the paralytic, the imbecile… the moral imbecile, the sexual pervert… many of the prostitutes… and some of the blind, some deaf-mutes”* among those deemed undesirable to society ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=report%20calling%20for%20the%20%E2%80%9Cpermanent,%E2%80%9D%20And)) ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=by%20%E2%80%9Cdegenerates%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20meant,You%20can%20find%20the%20report)). In the committee’s view, these individuals *“should not entail upon the next generation the burden which the present one has borne”* ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=report%20calling%20for%20the%20%E2%80%9Cpermanent,%E2%80%9D%20And)). 

Such language is shocking today, and it starkly contradicts the compassionate image of Gundry celebrated elsewhere. At the time, though, these ideas were part of the prevailing scientific thought on public welfare. Gundry likely saw “colonies” as a humane alternative to outright neglect or forced sterilization (the report even argued that segregation was a kinder way to prevent degenerates from becoming parents) ([Falls Church Committee Proposes Renaming Thomas Jefferson Elementary After Woman Who Wanted Government "Colonies" to "Permanently Segregate" "Degenerates" | Independent Women's Forum](https://www.iwf.org/2021/04/15/falls-church-committee-proposes-renaming-thomas-jefferson-elementary/#:~:text=The%20report%20notes%20that%20the,to%20become%20a%20parent%2C%E2%80%9D%20and)). Nonetheless, the revelation of her involvement in eugenics prompted **public backlash in 2021**. *“Even Mattie Gundry can’t withstand modern scrutiny,”* one local resident wrote, warning that naming a school after her would invite controversy over her “flawed” views ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=However%2C%20with%20little%20effort%2C%20I,and%20that%20they%20shall%20not)) ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=by%20%E2%80%9Cdegenerates%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%20meant,You%20can%20find%20the%20report)). Falls Church’s school board ultimately chose a different, non-person name for the school, in part to avoid this dilemma ([Meridian High Picked To Replace George Mason HS In Falls Church | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/meridian-high-picked-replace-george-mason-hs-falls-church#:~:text=FALLS%20CHURCH%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20The,Elementary%20to%20Oak%20Street%20Elementary)) ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=It%20would%20be%20reasonable%2C%20of,age%20is%20simply%20too%20risky)).

This re-evaluation does not erase Gundry’s positive contributions, but it adds nuance to her story. Like many progressive reformers of the early 20th century, she harbored beliefs we now recognize as deeply problematic. **Her legacy, therefore, is a mix of inspirational achievements and cautionary lessons.** As historian Kristin Shapiro noted, it is reasonable to “celebrate Miss Gundry’s accomplishments notwithstanding her flaws,” so long as we also acknowledge those flaws in context ([Letters to the Editor: Even Mattie Gundry Can’t Withstand Modern Scrutiny - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/04/26/letters-to-the-editor-even-mattie-gundry-cant-withstand-modern-scrutiny/#:~:text=here%20)).

## Remembering Mattie Gundry Today

In Falls Church today, Mattie Gundry is remembered as a complex but undeniably important figure in the city’s history. She has been called “a local icon… ahead of her time by advocating for the rights of others” ([Falls Church Committee Proposes Renaming Thomas Jefferson Elementary After Woman Who Wanted Government "Colonies" to "Permanently Segregate" "Degenerates" | Independent Women's Forum](https://www.iwf.org/2021/04/15/falls-church-committee-proposes-renaming-thomas-jefferson-elementary/#:~:text=The%20committee%20reports%20are%20in%2C,needs%20students)) ([Falls Church Committee Proposes Renaming Thomas Jefferson Elementary After Woman Who Wanted Government "Colonies" to "Permanently Segregate" "Degenerates" | Independent Women's Forum](https://www.iwf.org/2021/04/15/falls-church-committee-proposes-renaming-thomas-jefferson-elementary/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMattie%20Gundry%20Elementary%20School,needs%20students)). Her name still commands respect for what she achieved: opening doors for women in public leadership, giving hope and education to children once dismissed as “unteachable,” and helping steer a small Virginia town toward modernity. At the same time, recent discussions ensure that our remembrance of Gundry is holistic — celebrating her pioneering spirit while not omitting the uncomfortable parts of her story.

Falls Church has, in many ways, embraced **the better angels of Gundry’s legacy**. In 2020, the city’s new middle school was named for **Mary Ellen Henderson**, the Black educator who fought for equal schooling for African-American students during Gundry’s era. In 2021, the high school was renamed **Meridian** and the elementary school restored to **Oak Street**, partly to avoid the pitfalls of human names ([Meridian High Picked To Replace George Mason HS In Falls Church | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/meridian-high-picked-replace-george-mason-hs-falls-church#:~:text=FALLS%20CHURCH%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20The,Elementary%20to%20Oak%20Street%20Elementary)) ([Meridian High Picked To Replace George Mason HS In Falls Church | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/meridian-high-picked-replace-george-mason-hs-falls-church#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%2C%20the%20board%20unanimously,Truth%20and%20Justice%20Elementary%20School)). Through these choices, the community continues to strive for inclusivity and equity — the very principles Gundry championed in her push for suffrage and special education — while also recognizing the contributions of those who directly battled segregation. 

In the end, Mattie Gundry’s story is woven into the larger tapestry of Falls Church’s journey from a segregated past toward a more inclusive present. She is honored on the **Little City’s** Women’s History Walk and in its civic memory for good reason: **without her, Falls Church’s public education and public life would not have evolved as early or as boldly as they did**. As one local tribute put it, *“Every person in Falls Church should know about the contributions of Mattie Gundry and her peers.”* ([Guest Commentary: Celebrating 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2019/09/17/guest-commentary-celebrating-100-years-of-womens-suffrage/#:~:text=Mattie%20Gundry%20is%20a%20local,Mattie%20Gundry%20and%20her%20peers)) Her life reminds us that progress is often the work of determined individuals who push against the limits of their time — sometimes imperfectly, but with lasting impact.
