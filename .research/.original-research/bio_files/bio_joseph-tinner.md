# Joseph Tinner (1879–1978)

Joseph Tinner was a pioneering civil rights leader, community organizer, and master stonemason in Falls Church, Virginia. Born into one of the city’s first Black landowning families, he grew up in the Tinner Hill area (named for his family) after the Civil War ([Tinner Hill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinner_Hill#:~:text=Tinner%20Hill%20is%20an%20historic,2)). He honed his skills as a stonecutter and built numerous local structures out of the distinctive pink granite he quarried in Falls Church ([A Short History of Tinner Hill](https://states.aarp.org/virginia/a-short-history-of-tinner-hill#:~:text=A%20year%20later%2C%20the%20league,The%20archway%20at%20Tinner)), earning respect as a skilled craftsman.

In 1915, Falls Church’s Town Council attempted to enforce a segregation ordinance confining Black residents to a small section of town ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=relegate%20Black%20people%20to%20a,of%20the%20town%E2%80%99s%20land%20mass)). Tinner emerged at the forefront of the opposition: on January 8, 1915, he and educator Dr. E.B. Henderson convened a meeting of African-American residents at Tinner’s home to strategize ([History | NOVA Parks](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/tinner-hill-historic-park/history#:~:text=On%20January%208%2C%201915%2C%20Mr,economic%20opportunities%20for%20all%20people)). They formed the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) to fight the law, sending protest letters to town officials and even seeking support from NAACP co-founder W.E.B. Du Bois ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20CCPL%20wrote,town%20on%20the%20issue%20of)). Tinner’s courageous leadership helped galvanize the community, and their legal challenge—bolstered by a 1917 U.S. Supreme Court ruling—ultimately nullified Falls Church’s segregation measure ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=The%20CCPL%20then%20brought%20a,the%20ordinance%20in%20Falls%20Church)).

In 1918, the CCPL evolved into the Falls Church and Vicinity branch of the NAACP – the nation’s first rural NAACP chapter – with Joseph Tinner elected as its inaugural president ([Tinner Hill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinner_Hill#:~:text=The%20Colored%20Citizens%20Protective%20League,3%20%5D%5B%204)). Under Tinner’s leadership, this local NAACP branch not only defended Black residents’ rights in Falls Church but also helped spur the formation of new NAACP chapters across Northern Virginia ([Falls Church - History and Social Justice](https://justice.tougaloo.edu/sundowntown/falls-church-va/#:~:text=Church%20and%20Vicinity%20Branch%20of,risked%20their%20lives%20and%20livelihoods)). Even as Jim Crow pressures persisted, Tinner remained a prominent civic leader in Falls Church. In the 1920s, he saw his own family’s land seized for the construction of Lee Highway (now South Washington Street), which was routed directly through the Tinner Hill community ([A Short History of Tinner Hill](https://states.aarp.org/virginia/a-short-history-of-tinner-hill#:~:text=Many%20of%20the%20properties%20in,were%20taken%20by%20eminent%20domain)).

Henderson, and the first rural NAACP branch ([Tinner Hill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinner_Hill#:~:text=Tinner%20Hill%20has%20two%20memorial,density%20apartment%20buildings)). It remains a visible reminder of Tinner’s enduring impact as a trailblazer for civil rights in Falls Church.
