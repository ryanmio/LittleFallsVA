# Harry Birge: Real Estate Promoter and Segregationist in 1910s–20s Falls Church

Harry C. Birge was a Washington, D.C.-based attorney and real estate promoter who played a significant role in shaping housing segregation in Falls Church, Virginia during the 1910s and 1920s ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)). Operating in partnership with local figures like Samuel R. Styles – a Falls Church councilman and the husband of Mary Riley Styles – Birge pushed for policies and practices that excluded non-white residents from white neighborhoods. His efforts ranged from advocating one of Virginia’s first racial zoning ordinances to embedding **racially restrictive covenants** in new subdivision deeds. Birge’s actions left a lasting imprint on the city’s racial geography, even as they provoked early civil rights resistance. Today, historians are beginning to reckon with Birge’s legacy in what had long been a **forgotten chapter** of Falls Church history ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)).

## Building Falls Church’s “White Only” Neighborhoods

Birge emerged on the Falls Church scene in the 1910s, drawn by suburban real estate opportunities. After marrying Jean Elizabeth Riley – a member of a prominent Falls Church landowning family – he gained local influence and property interests ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=remains%20in%20the%20house,to%20them%20as%20%E2%80%9CPoverty%20Pines%E2%80%9D)). By 1914–1915, Birge and his associate Samuel R. Styles were working in tandem to advance segregationist housing policies. Styles sat on the Falls Church Town Council, and together they backed a **racial zoning ordinance** that aimed to reserve most of the town for white residents only ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=1914%2C%20Falls%20Church%20Council%20members%2C,rural%20branch%20of%20the%20NAACP)). In late 1914, as the ordinance was debated, Mayor Charles H. Herndon warned that a Black family was planning to rent in West Falls Church – a prospect segregationists like Birge and Styles found unacceptable ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). Acting on a new state law allowing “segregation districts” by race, Councilman Styles (from the wealthy Cherry Hill/Styles family) formally introduced an ordinance prohibiting any person from selling or renting property to African Americans in designated white areas ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20and%20thought%20the,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). Birge, though not an elected official, **actively promoted this measure** behind the scenes. Historian Krystyn Moon notes that Birge “clearly had an agenda to segregate Falls Church, pushing wherever he can” ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)).

**The 1915 Falls Church segregation ordinance** that Birge championed was extreme. It divided the town into racial zones: approximately 95% of Falls Church was mapped as a **“white district”** where Black people could neither own nor rent property, leaving only a small section (around 5% of land) for “Colored only” use ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=racial%20tensions%20with%20the%20proposal,of%20the%20town%E2%80%99s%20land%20mass)) ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSun%20Down%E2%80%9D%20areas,of%20the%20town%E2%80%99s%20land%20mass)). In effect, if enacted fully, this would have **forced Black families out** of most of the town – an estimated two-thirds of the African American population would have been compelled to sell their homes and relocate (["The Grandfather of Black Basketball" | Harvard Magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/12/edwin-bancroft-henderson-the-grandfather-of-black-basketball#:~:text=Henderson%20and%20his%20wife%20moved,to%20sell%20their%20homes%20and)). The proposed law went so far as to impose “sun-down” restrictions, meaning Black individuals risked arrest for being present in white-designated areas after dark ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=racial%20tensions%20with%20the%20proposal,of%20the%20town%E2%80%99s%20land%20mass)). This kind of residential segregation by ordinance was unprecedented in Virginia at the time (predating even Richmond’s and Norfolk’s efforts) and reflected the rising tide of Jim Crow segregation in the South after **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**. Birge and Styles succeeded in getting the **racial zoning law approved by the Falls Church council in January 1915**, by a 4-1 vote ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2011%2C%201915%2C%20a,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)). Cross burnings by the local Ku Klux Klan punctuated the tense atmosphere, signaling white supremacist support for the new restrictions ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=Despite%20cross%20burnings%20and%20a,a%20result%20of%20their%20activism)).

## Confrontation with Civil Rights Activists

 ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/)) *Edwin B. “E.B.” Henderson (pictured as a young man) publicly challenged Birge’s segregationist agenda in 1915 ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=letter%20to%20Birge%20and%20partner,%E2%80%9D)). Henderson co-founded the Colored Citizens Protective League at Falls Church’s Tinner Hill, which fought to overturn the town’s “white only” housing ordinance.* 

Birge’s push for enforced segregation **galvanized local Black residents** into one of the nation’s earliest rural civil rights campaigns. In January 1915, educator and activist **Edwin Bancroft “E.B.” Henderson** led a group of prominent African American citizens in forming the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=On%20January%208%2C%201915%2C%20Edwin,on%20the%20proposed%20segregation%20ordinance)). Meeting at Joseph Tinner’s home on Tinner Hill, they strategized resistance to the new law. Henderson – who had moved to Falls Church in 1910 and would soon establish the first rural branch of the NAACP – took a bold step: he wrote open letters to city leaders, businessmen, and even churches, demanding they justify their support for segregation ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=held%20at%20the%20home%20of,on%20the%20proposed%20segregation%20ordinance)). A **pointed letter was sent to Harry Birge and Samuel Styles** in February 1915, challenging their campaign to segregate the town ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,you%20and%20other%20white%20residents)). “We would like to know your reasons for favoring this [zoning ordinance] legislation,” Henderson wrote, adding, “what might be assured by us to cause you to give up your fight upon us” ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=letter%20to%20Birge%20and%20partner,%E2%80%9D)). Henderson’s letter shrewdly addressed Birge’s own fears, noting they’d heard Birge believed that Black buyers moving near white residents (including possibly near Birge’s own home) would “lower the value” of white-owned property ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=your%20reasons%20for%20favoring%20this,%E2%80%9D)). It was a direct appeal to reason – or at least to expose the racist assumptions undergirding Birge’s efforts.

Henderson and the CCPL also **confronted the Town Council** in person. On January 11, 1915, Henderson and Joseph Tinner presented formal objections at a council meeting, denouncing the segregation ordinance as unjust ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2011%2C%201915%2C%20a,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)). Although the council initially brushed off their protests and even strengthened the ordinance, the CCPL did not relent ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=Henderson%20and%20read%20papers%20objecting,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)). Henderson reached out to NAACP leaders in Washington and New York, corresponding with W.E.B. Du Bois to get legal support ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2020%2C%201915%2C%20Dr,formed%20just%20six%20years%20earlier)). This grassroots resistance soon bore fruit. By 1917, the **U.S. Supreme Court struck down government-enforced racial zoning** in the landmark case *Buchanan v. Warley*, which declared such ordinances unconstitutional ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=the%20analysis%20of%20the%20drama,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)). Falls Church’s attempt to legislate segregated neighborhoods was rendered legally void (even though shockingly, the invalidated law lingered on the city’s books until as late as 1998) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=the%20analysis%20of%20the%20drama,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)). Thanks to pressure from Henderson’s group – and the Supreme Court’s ruling – Birge’s 1915 ordinance was never fully enforced. Falls Church’s Black families largely **held their ground**, and the first rural NAACP branch was formally established at Tinner Hill in 1918 as a lasting legacy of their successful challenge ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=1914%2C%20Falls%20Church%20Council%20members%2C,rural%20branch%20of%20the%20NAACP)) ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=Despite%20cross%20burnings%20and%20a,a%20result%20of%20their%20activism)). Birge had lost the public fight to zone Black residents out of town, but he was not finished trying to impose segregation by other means.

## “Caucasian Only” Covenants in New Subdivisions

With legal segregation by city ordinance struck down, Birge turned to **private contracts** to achieve the same racist aims. During the 1920s, he leveraged his role as a real estate attorney and developer to insert **racially restrictive covenants** into property deeds in Falls Church. These covenants were clauses written into **subdivision sales agreements** that forbade the buyer (and all future owners) from ever selling or renting the property to non-white people. While not public law, such covenants were enforceable among private parties and became a common tool across the U.S. to keep neighborhoods exclusively white after 1917. Birge was at the forefront of this tactic in Falls Church ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)).

One of Birge’s notable projects was the creation of the **“Woodland” subdivision** in the early 1920s. Woodland was a residential development Birge planned on former farmland in the western part of town (around today’s 700 block of Fulton Avenue, between North Oak Street and Pennsylvania Avenue) ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=property%20deeds%20in%20the%20City,Oak%20Street%2C%20is%20shown%20below)). In **November 1922**, Harry Birge and his wife Jeanne Birge recorded a *deed of dedication* for Woodland’s lots – and the deed included strict racial covenants. A surviving example from a November 3, 1922 property deed (for the sale of a lot to one A.T. Holtman) shows the exact language Birge used:

 ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/)) *Excerpt from a 1922 deed for Birge’s “Woodland” subdivision in Falls Church, specifying that no property shall be “leased, devised, sold or conveyed to any one not of the Caucasian race,” under penalty of reversion of the title ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,%E2%80%9D)).*

The covenant (highlighted above in a contemporary copy of the deed) mandated that **only members of “the Caucasian race” could own or occupy the property** ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=drafted%20for%20Birge%20and%20wife,%E2%80%9D)). It stated that if any lot were ever sold or rented to someone **“not of the Caucasian race,” the title would immediately revert** back to the seller (in other words, the Birges) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=drafted%20for%20Birge%20and%20wife,%E2%80%9D)). This draconian reversion clause was a strong disincentive: it threatened white buyers with losing their land if they ever tried to transfer it to a Black family or other non-white person. Birge also included a requirement that any house built in Woodland cost at least $2,500 – a way to keep out lower-income buyers, which in that era often disproportionately affected minorities ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,that%20neither%20said%20lots%20nor)). These deed covenants effectively ensured Woodland would remain a white enclave. Indeed, the **entire subdivision was encumbered** by such restrictions as a “condition running with the land,” binding all future owners to Birge’s segregationist terms ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=Then%20in%201915%2C%20the%20Town,Oak%20Street%2C%20is%20shown%20below)).

Birge was not alone in using private covenants to enforce housing segregation. Across Northern Virginia and the D.C. suburbs, developers followed a similar pattern in the 1920s. In Falls Church, another prominent developer, **Ruby Lee Minar**, subdivided large tracts (such as Greenway Downs in 1927) and inserted clauses banning sale or lease to “a negro or a person of negro descent” ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Her%20sales%20agreement%E2%80%94posted%20by%20the,%E2%80%9D)). In Arlington and Alexandria, new neighborhoods like Lyon Park and others carried covenants excluding African Americans and sometimes Jewish Americans ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Timed%20locally%20to%20coincide%20with,such%20documents%20elsewhere%2C%20she%20added)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=On%20a%20grander%20scale%20was,sides%20of%20South%20Washington%20St)). Birge, however, was **a pioneer in Falls Church’s covenant movement**, implementing these restrictions in the early 1920s when the practice was just gaining national momentum. Historian Krystyn Moon notes that covenants in Northern Virginia appeared “very late” compared to other regions – but they **proliferated after World War I**, coinciding with Birge’s activities ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Timed%20locally%20to%20coincide%20with,such%20documents%20elsewhere%2C%20she%20added)). By Moon’s count, language barring “disfavored groups” (chiefly Black buyers) can be found in documents for some **1,000 properties** in Falls Church, including downtown parcels and the Woodland and Greenway Downs tracts ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=racially%20exclusionary%20real%20estate%20covenants,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)). Birge’s hand touched many of these, either directly as drafter of deeds or indirectly by setting a precedent emulated by others. The result was a patchwork of exclusionary clauses on property titles that kept Falls Church’s new housing stock virtually all-white for decades.

## Segregation’s Impact on Falls Church Geography

Birge’s efforts – first through the nixed ordinance and later through private covenants – profoundly **shaped the racial geography of Falls Church**. Although the 1915 segregation law was nullified, its spirit lived on in the **deeply embedded deed restrictions** that Birge and his peers imposed. These covenants effectively drew invisible color lines through the young city. Neighborhoods like Woodland (and later Greenway Downs and others) were off-limits to people of color, ensuring that the growing white population would not face Black neighbors in those areas. Meanwhile, Falls Church’s African Americans remained concentrated in older enclaves or just outside the town’s borders. Many Black families had long resided in the Tinner Hill area (which had been partly cut out of town limits in the 1890s gerrymander) or in nearby areas along South Washington Street and Annandale Road ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Other%20properties%20Moon%20uncovered%20are,and%20black%20clergyman%20Robert%20Johnson)). With new subdivisions closed to them, these communities became even more isolated. Some Black residents did move away under pressure – **Henderson later noted that many Black families left Falls Church** during the ordinance scare, rather than endure hostile conditions ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=the%20analysis%20of%20the%20drama,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)). Those who stayed endured tacit segregation in housing for years to come, as well as other Jim Crow barriers in schools and public facilities.

Birge’s segregationist covenants also fit into a **broader regional pattern** of racial exclusion that defined 20th-century housing development. In the Washington, D.C. suburbs, white developers commonly used covenants to bar minorities, contributing to a racially homogeneous suburban belt. This practice was **legally sanctioned until 1948**, when the Supreme Court (in *Shelley v. Kraemer*) finally ruled that courts could not enforce racial covenants. By that time, Falls Church had remained a nearly all-white community, in no small part due to the groundwork laid by Birge and others in the 1920s. Even after 1948, the legacy of these covenants persisted – while they were no longer legally enforceable, they sent a clear message about who was welcome. It wasn’t until the Civil Rights era (Fair Housing Act of 1968) that housing discrimination was explicitly outlawed, and only in recent years have such covenant clauses been identified and denounced as offensive relics.

On an individual level, **Birge’s actions spurred a backlash that strengthened the civil rights movement in Falls Church**. The very act of imposing segregation rallied Black leaders like E.B. Henderson to become lifelong fighters for equality. Henderson, for example, went on to lead the Virginia NAACP and wrote extensively against segregation (he even reported receiving KKK threats, including a letter vowing to lynch him, in the years after opposing Birge’s plans) (["The Grandfather of Black Basketball" | Harvard Magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/12/edwin-bancroft-henderson-the-grandfather-of-black-basketball#:~:text=1918%2C%20Henderson%20formed%20the%20first,number%20unlisted%20for%2050%20years)). The resistance in Falls Church became an early example of how Black communities could organize to beat back Jim Crow at the local level – a proud chapter in the city’s history, often highlighted by today’s Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation. Ironically, **Birge’s name faded into obscurity even as Henderson’s grew renowned**. Birge died in the late 1920s (his influence waning as others took up the mantle of exclusion), whereas Henderson lived into the 1970s, witnessing the dismantling of segregation. In a sense, the segregated landscape Birge envisioned began to crumble within his lifetime: by mid-century, Falls Church slowly integrated its library, schools, and public spaces, led by the very people he once tried to exclude ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=Change%20Begins%20in%20the%20Library)) ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=you,directly%20across%20North%20Virginia%20Avenue)).

## Remembering (or Forgetting) Birge’s Legacy

For many years, Falls Church’s public history **largely ignored Harry Birge’s role** in cementing segregation. Civic narratives tended to celebrate the Tinner Hill activists and the city’s eventual integration, while glossing over or forgetting the individuals who drove the segregationist policies in the first place ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)). Birge’s name does not appear on any marker or plaque; no street or subdivision carries his name. In fact, some of those who enforced segregation were part of prominent white families often remembered for more positive contributions – for instance, Birge’s partner Samuel Styles is remembered through the Mary Riley Styles Public Library (named after his wife), yet until recently few locals realized **Styles and Birge had engineered a 1914 scheme to ban Black property ownership in Falls Church** ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=of%20the%20nineteenth%20century%20Falls,rural%20branch%20of%20the%20NAACP)). This uncomfortable truth was seldom discussed in local histories. As historian Edwin Henderson II (E.B. Henderson’s grandson) observed, Falls Church “recorded a history that is part prominent and part ignored,” with the story of racially exclusionary housing largely omitted from view ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)).

In the past few years, however, scholars and community researchers have begun **unearthing the documentary evidence** of Birge’s segregationist ventures. In 2023, a team led by sociologist Janine DeWitt and historian Krystyn Moon pored over Fairfax County land records and uncovered racially restrictive covenants tied to roughly a thousand Falls Church properties ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Language%20in%20sales%20agreements%20that,Greenway%20Downs%20and%20Woodland%20neighborhoods)). Their research (part of a nationwide project to map racial covenants) shed fresh light on Birge’s Woodland tract and similar developments. The *Falls Church News-Press* reported on these findings, explicitly naming Harry Birge and Ruby Lee Minar as **“key players” in 1920s segregation** real estate ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)). The article even quoted the rediscovered 1915 letter from E.B. Henderson to Birge, bringing this confrontation out of the archives and into public awareness ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=letter%20to%20Birge%20and%20partner,%E2%80%9D)). For many current residents of the Woodland neighborhood, it was eye-opening news – a 2023 survey found none of them knew their homes had once been subject to 100-year-old racial covenants ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Inquiries%20from%20the%20News,%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20good%20sample)). One African American homeowner on Fulton Avenue expressed surprise, noting that today Woodland is diverse and he personally had “never encountered any prejudice” there ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Inquiries%20from%20the%20News,%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20good%20sample)). Such reactions underscore how thoroughly Birge’s covenants had been buried in time, their effects dissipated even as the clauses quietly persisted in deed books.

Today, Falls Church is confronting this history openly. The city’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan update officially recognized the Tinner Hill area’s historic significance and the **struggles against Birge’s 1915 ordinance**, and it acknowledged the covenants that followed ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=At%20the%20City%20Council%20meeting,Falls%20Church%20passed%20in%201915)) ([Establishing the Tinner Hill Historic and Cultural District in the Falls Church Comprehensive Plan | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/tinner-hill-historic-and-cultural-district/#:~:text=Then%20in%201915%2C%20the%20Town,Oak%20Street%2C%20is%20shown%20below)). Public history initiatives – from library exhibits to neighborhood heritage trails – now tell the fuller story of how segregation was imposed and resisted. Harry Birge, once a behind-the-scenes powerbroker, is being reintroduced not as a laudable figure but as a **case study in how Northern segregation worked** at the grassroots level. By documenting Birge’s real estate deals, racist covenants, and clashes with civil rights pioneers, Falls Church is reckoning with a legacy that was long omitted from its official narrative. In doing so, the community ensures that the **segregationist tactics of promoters like Birge** are not forgotten, but rather serve as a reminder of the challenges overcome in the pursuit of an inclusive city ([Racist F.C.
