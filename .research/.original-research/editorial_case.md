# The Case for Renaming Falls Church to “Little Falls”

## Introduction  
Falls Church, Virginia is an independent city whose very name reflects colonial heritage – it was named after an 18th-century Anglican church. Yet a deeper look into the area’s history reveals a richer, older legacy centered on the **Little Falls** of the Potomac and troubling chapters of colonial injustice. The church’s founders and leaders were prominent colonials (including slaveholding gentry), and their establishment rose atop lands long inhabited by Native Americans. By uncovering the true origins of the name *“Falls Church,”* the biography of Colonel James Wren (the church’s architect), the actions of early vestry members, the Indigenous significance of the Little Falls area, and examples of other places that shed colonial names, we can build a compelling, fact-based case for renaming Falls Church to **“Little Falls.”**

## Origins of the Name **“Falls Church”**  
 ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/)) The Falls Church building (completed 1769) is a colonial-era brick church designed by vestryman Col. James Wren ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=Architect%20and%20Vestryman%20James%20Wren,laid%20in%20Flemish%20bond%20design)). The city takes its name from this church, which in turn was named for its proximity to the Potomac River’s Little Falls. Early records indicate the site was initially just a frontier chapel – **the “Upper Church” of Truro Parish (est. 1734)** – identified by local landmarks. In fact, a 1747 map labels it simply “the Upper Church” near “the crossroads at Michael Reagan’s” tavern ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=Originally%20called%20,then%20eventually%2C%20The%20Falls%20Church)). But as it grew in importance, people began referring to it as **“the church up at the falls,”** to distinguish it from churches downriver. By 1757 the Anglican congregation had officially adopted the name **“The Falls Church,”** explicitly referencing its location near the Little Falls of the Potomac ([Little Falls (Potomac River) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Falls_(Potomac_River)#:~:text=the%20Potomac%20as%20far%20as,referenced%20this%20location%20near%20the)). One account from a local historical society notes that *“The name ‘The Falls Church’ came from its location on the road to the ferry below the Little Falls of the Potomac River.”* ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=Originally%20a%20wooden%20structure%20built,Falls%20of%20the%20Potomac%20River)) In other words, the colonial church (and later the community around it) was named after the **Little Falls** – the nearby rapids that marked an important Potomac River crossing. Over time, the surrounding settlement took on the church’s name, and it remained when the city incorporated in 1948 ([Early History | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory#:~:text=The%20name%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Falls%20Church%2C%E2%80%9D,it%20was%20incorporated%20in%201948)). The **original meaning** of “Falls Church,” therefore, is directly tied to geography: a church by the **Little Falls**. This origin raises the question – why should the city’s identity celebrate the church, and not the more ancient natural and cultural landmark of Little Falls itself?

## Colonel James Wren – Architect of the Church and His Colonial Ties  
The construction of The Falls Church in the 1760s is inseparable from the legacy of **Colonel James Wren**, its architect. Wren was a prominent Virginian: a militia colonel in the Revolutionary War, a sheriff and justice in Fairfax County, and one of the few recognized architects in colonial Virginia ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=By%20the%201760s%2C%20he%20had,of%20enslaved%20people%20in%201767)) ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=James%20Wren%20,7)). In 1766, Wren (then a vestry member) was chosen to design a new brick church to replace the decaying wooden chapel ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=tobacco%2C%20the%20church%20began%20as,Falls%20of%20the%20Potomac%20River)) ([Early History | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory#:~:text=In%201762%20the%20wood%20building,of%20the%20new%20Fairfax%20Parish)). He drew up plans in the fashionable Georgian style and oversaw construction from 1767 to 1769 ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=Architect%20and%20Vestryman%20James%20Wren,laid%20in%20Flemish%20bond%20design)). However, the labor that built Falls Church was not free: **Wren, a slaveowner, utilized enslaved people to do the work** ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=This%20stood%20until%201769%2C%20when,5)). Historical research confirms that **enslaved laborers laid the bricks and crafted the woodwork** under Wren’s direction ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=In%201769%2C%20architect%20James%20Wren,with%20the%20institution%20of%20slavery26)) ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=church%27s%20impact%20on%20the%20community,justifying%20slavery%20in%20the%20community)). George Washington even hosted Wren’s master bricklayer at Mount Vernon during the project ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=This%20stood%20until%201769%2C%20when,5)), underscoring the connections among the colonial elite. Wren himself was deeply entwined with slavery – at the time of his death in 1815, he owned **20 enslaved persons** ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Wren%20died%20in%201815.,41)). 

Wren’s influence extended beyond the church. He operated **Wren’s Tavern** in Falls Church (circa 1785) and later designed the Fairfax County Courthouse (1800) which still stands today ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=In%201790%2C%20the%20District%20of,stone%20on%20Van%20Buren%20Street)). Yet, despite his civic roles, Wren’s legacy is tainted by the fact that his wealth and works were built literally on the backs of enslaved African Americans. A recent study of Falls Church’s history identifies Wren among the church leaders who benefited economically from slavery ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=The%20report%20represents%20the%20first,The%20Falls%20Church%C2%A0is)). In light of these facts, celebrating the “Falls Church” name by extension honors a man (and a colonial system) that upheld human bondage. Renaming the city to “Little Falls” would shift the focus from Wren’s church to a neutral natural feature, disentangling the city’s identity from an architect who enslaved others. It would also better acknowledge that **the true makers of the church included the unnamed enslaved people** who received no credit at the time ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=In%201769%2C%20architect%20James%20Wren,with%20the%20institution%20of%20slavery26)) ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=church%27s%20impact%20on%20the%20community,justifying%20slavery%20in%20the%20community)). Their contribution, long overlooked, is part of the hidden truth behind the Falls Church name.

## Vestry Members and the Colonial Power Structure  
From its founding, The Falls Church was led by vestrymen – local elite landowners who managed parish affairs. These men were pillars of colonial Virginia society, and many had direct roles in shaping America. Notably, **George Mason** (author of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights) became a vestryman in 1748 ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=and%20west%2C%20a%20second%20location,likely%20built%20by%20enslaved%20people)), and **George Washington** himself was appointed a church warden in 1763 to oversee building the new church ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=of%20wood%2C%20likely%20by%20enslaved,the%20area%E2%80%99s%20growth%20and%20many)). Other vestrymen included figures like **George William Fairfax** (of the Fairfax family) and Colonel **Charles Broadwater**, all of whom were affluent planters or politicians ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=Important%20and%20influential%20men%20attended,John%20West%3B%20and%20Charles%20Broadwater)). On paper, these vestrymen were tending to church business, but in practice they represented the **political, economic, and social power structure** of the colony. They brought enslaved Black laborers to church (Washington, for example, enslaved hundreds of people on his plantations) and dispossessed the native inhabitants of their lands. The vestry controlled parish tithes and poor relief, wielding authority that often reinforced the hierarchies of race and class in that era ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=the%20collection%20of%20tithes16,did%20not%20adhere%20to%20the)) ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=match%20at%20L108%20In%201733%2C,all%20the%20inside%20work%20meticulously)).

Critically, **new research has illuminated just how enmeshed the vestry and clergy were in slavery**. In 2024, Falls Church’s own Episcopal parish released a report detailing the church’s ties to slavery. It found that from the 1730s to 1860s, the rectors and vestrymen of The Falls Church **collectively held about 750 people in bondage** ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=New%20research%20concludes%20that%20rectors,between%20the%201730s%20and%201860s)). In other words, the very leaders who gave Falls Church its name also enslaved hundreds of human beings. They profited from, and often fervently defended, the system of slavery ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=FALLS%20CHURCH%20CITY%2C%20October%2021%2C,the%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church)) ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=The%20report%20represents%20the%20first,The%20Falls%20Church%C2%A0is)). This hard truth undermines any romantic notion that the city’s namesake church was purely a benign community pillar – it was also an economic and social instrument of oppression. Moreover, the vestry’s outlook was exclusively colonial and Eurocentric. **Indigenous peoples were not part of their community** – by the time the church was established, local Native American tribes had been largely driven away (as discussed below). The vestry did nothing to preserve Indigenous history; if anything, their presence helped erase it. 

It’s telling that parish records from the 18th and early 19th centuries contain meticulous notes about church business and local white families, yet virtually no mention of the Native Americans who had lived there for millennia. The absence itself is evidence of **erasure**. The colonial leaders of Falls Church simply wrote the Indigenous peoples out of the story. When building the new brick church, the vestry even **used enslaved African Americans as labor** ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Washington%20and%20George%20William%20Fairfax,likely%20built%20by%20enslaved%20people)), but those workers remained nameless in the records – a stark example of how those not fitting the Anglo-colonial mold were marginalized or omitted. In sum, the “Falls Church” legacy is bound up with a colonial power structure that upheld slavery and pushed Native Americans aside. Renaming the city offers a chance to repudiate those aspects of our history. Instead of honoring the vestry’s colonial worldview, a name like “Little Falls” would honor the land’s original identity, **untainted by human hierarchies**.

## Indigenous Presence and the Significance of **Little Falls**  
 ([image]()) The **Little Falls** of the Potomac are a series of small rapids where the river drops over the Fall Line, just upstream of modern Washington, D.C. This unassuming natural landmark was central to the region’s human history long before any church existed. Archaeological evidence shows that people lived in and traveled through the Falls Church area for **at least 10,000 years** ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=The%20area%20around%20Falls%20Church,permanent%20Native%20American%20settlement%2018)). Numerous Algonquian-speaking tribes inhabited this region of Northern Virginia, including the **Doeg (Dogue)**, **Tauxenent**, and **Patawomeck (Potomac)** tribes, among others ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=Several%20Algonquian,Plain%20and%20the%20Piedmont%20Plateau3)). The Potomac River’s fall line – marked by Little Falls and the bigger Great Falls upstream – was more than a geological boundary. It was a meeting point of ecosystems and cultures. The Powhatan Confederacy’s influence extended up to this fall line, and multiple native groups established villages and fishing camps along the Potomac’s banks ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=Several%20Algonquian,Plain%20and%20the%20Piedmont%20Plateau3)) ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=with%20their%20influence%20extending%20throughout,Plain%20and%20the%20Piedmont%20Plateau3)).

The Little Falls area in particular held great **cultural and economic importance** for Indigenous peoples. Captain John Smith, when he explored the Potomac in 1608, encountered Native communities as far upriver as Little Falls. He noted at least *“11 different native groups”* between the Chesapeake and Little Falls ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Until%20the%20late%201600s%2C%20the,trails%20from%20here%20to%20the)), and observed that the woods were teeming with game – *“deer, buffaloes, bears and turkey, the woods do swarm with them”* – and that the soil was *“extremely fertile.”* ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Little%20and%20Great%20Falls,%E2%80%9D%20%2F692)) This paints a picture of a rich environment that native peoples thrived in. An English trader, Henry Fleet, wrote in 1630 of seeing Indigenous people catching abundant sturgeon and fish at the falls ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Little%20and%20Great%20Falls,%E2%80%9D%20%2F692)). Indeed, **Little Falls was a prime fishing spot** and a natural gathering place. Archaeologists have unearthed Native American artifacts (dated ~AD 200–1500) near modern Falls Church, such as at a site on present-day Crossman Farm, suggesting a permanent settlement in the vicinity ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=The%20area%20around%20Falls%20Church,permanent%20Native%20American%20settlement%2018)). Long before Europeans, trails crisscrossed the area: a major Algonquian trail ran through what is now Falls Church (near Tinner Hill) toward the Potomac at Chain Bridge, and another major trail ran east–west roughly along today’s Broad Street ([History of the Land & People of Tinner Hill — Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/history-of-the-land-people-of-tinner-hill#:~:text=For%20thousands%20of%20years%2C%20an,Maple%20Avenue%20and%20Annandale%20Road)) ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=Indian%20trails%20meandered%20past%20the,trails%20became%20important%20transportation%20routes)). These paths converged near the falls, because **Little Falls was a key trading nexus**. 

Historical sources confirm that local tribes used Little Falls as a **trading post and meeting ground**. During peaceful times, communities would gather at the falls to share the plentiful fish and exchange goods ([Big history, colorful tales can be found all along Little Falls Road | ARLnow.com](https://www.arlnow.com/2025/03/07/big-history-colorful-tales-can-be-found-all-along-little-falls-road/#:~:text=Long%20before%20Capt,for%20up%20to%2010%2C000%20years)). In times of conflict, controlling the falls meant controlling an important food source and chokepoint – thus it became *“a key objective both for military and economic reasons.”* ([Big history, colorful tales can be found all along Little Falls Road | ARLnow.com](https://www.arlnow.com/2025/03/07/big-history-colorful-tales-can-be-found-all-along-little-falls-road/#:~:text=Sometimes%20relations%20between%20those%20tribes,other%20times%20they%20wer%20not)) The falls also marked the upriver limit of navigation; boats from tidewater could come no further. As a result, overland routes developed around the falls: the “Great Ridge Trail” from the interior met routes to Little Falls, facilitating commerce between coastal and Piedmont peoples ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=navigated%20up%20to%20the%20Potomack,turkey%2C%20the%20woods%20do%20swarm)). When colonists arrived, they too followed these established routes. By the 1730s, the old Indian trails by Little Falls had become some of the **most important roads for colonists** moving into the area ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=Indian%20trails%20meandered%20past%20the,trails%20became%20important%20transportation%20routes)). One road led to a ferry crossing just below Little Falls – the very ferry referenced by the church’s name ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=Originally%20a%20wooden%20structure%20built,Falls%20of%20the%20Potomac%20River)) ([Early History | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory#:~:text=The%20name%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Falls%20Church%2C%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%9CThe%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%9D%20was)). Another route became known as **Little Falls Road**, which an 18th-century map labels explicitly as *“Road to the Falls.”* ([Big history, colorful tales can be found all along Little Falls Road | ARLnow.com](https://www.arlnow.com/2025/03/07/big-history-colorful-tales-can-be-found-all-along-little-falls-road/#:~:text=The%20mid,the%20same%20location%20as%20today)) This shows that even in colonial times, Little Falls remained the orienting feature for travel. 

In short, **Little Falls encapsulates a far deeper and broader heritage than the church does**. It was central to indigenous life for millennia, noted by early European explorers, and served as the anchor point for settlement-era transportation. The church, by contrast, has only stood for about 250 years – a blink of an eye relative to Indigenous history. Renaming the city *Little Falls* would highlight this enduring natural landmark and acknowledge that the story of this place did not begin with the colonial church. It would honor the Indigenous people who first named, used, and loved this land (even if their names for the falls are lost to history), rather than the colonial institutions that displaced them. Considering that the **very name “Falls Church” only exists because of Little Falls**, it is fitting to let Little Falls reclaim the spotlight. As one local historian put it, *Falls Church “was identified as the [church] near the falls” from the start* ([Early History | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory#:~:text=The%20name%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Falls%20Church%2C%E2%80%9D,it%20was%20incorporated%20in%201948)) – so why not just honor the **Little Falls** directly?

Furthermore, confronting the Indigenous history helps correct a “suppressed” narrative. By the late 1600s, after decades of disease, warfare, and land loss, the native tribes of the Falls Church area had been decimated and dispersed – *“forcibly removed from their lands”* by the colonial onslaught ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=The%20First%2C%20Second%2C%20and%20Third,the%20transformation%20of%20the%20region)). Treaties and wars (including the Anglo-Powhatan Wars and Bacon’s Rebellion in the 1670s) led to the **eradication of Native communities in Northern Virginia**, effectively erasing their way of life in what would become Falls Church ([History](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#fn24#:~:text=The%20First%2C%20Second%2C%20and%20Third,the%20transformation%20of%20the%20region)). This painful erasure is exactly why names matter: **restoring Indigenous place names or landmarks can be a form of justice**, keeping the memory of those first peoples alive. The name “Little Falls” is a small step in that direction – it at least shifts the focus from a colonial church to a natural feature that Indigenous tribes would recognize. It’s also a name that doesn’t celebrate any one person or group over another. Instead of commemorating colonial vestrymen, “Little Falls” celebrates a geographic reality that belongs to everyone.

## Precedents for Renaming Places to Address Colonial Legacies  
Falls Church is not alone in grappling with a name inherited from a colonial past. Across the United States, there is a growing movement to **rename cities, towns, and natural features** that honor oppressive figures or ignore Indigenous heritage. Embracing the name “Little Falls” would align with many successful efforts to correct or **“decolonize”** place names. Some notable examples include:

- **Denali (Alaska)** – North America’s tallest mountain was known as *Denali* (“the great one” in the Koyukon Athabascan language) for centuries. It was renamed *Mount McKinley* by settlers in 1896 to honor a U.S. president. In 2015, after decades of advocacy by Alaska Natives, the U.S. officially restored the mountain’s Indigenous name to Denali ([Denali–Mount McKinley naming dispute - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali%E2%80%93Mount_McKinley_naming_dispute#:~:text=2015%3A%20Federal%20designation%20changed%20to,under%20authority%20of%20federal)) ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=And%20there%20are%2C%20of%20course%2C,of%20some%20who%20actively%20worked)). This change recognized that the colonial name had supplanted a native one, and correcting it was an act of respect for the original inhabitants and their language ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=imposed%20the%20names%20of%20their,nations%E2%80%94Washington%2C%20Jefferson%2C%20Custer%2C%20Carson%2C%20Jackson)).

- **Black Elk Peak (South Dakota)** – Formerly *Harney Peak*, named after a 19th-century U.S. General infamous for massacring Native Americans, this mountain in the Black Hills was renamed in 2016 to honor **Black Elk**, a revered Oglala Lakota holy man ([Highest Peak in South Dakota Renamed for Oglala Lakota Medicine Man | Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/highest-peak-south-dakota-renamed-oglala-lakota-medicine-man-180960133/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20the%20United%20States,among%20the%20Lakota)) ([Highest Peak in South Dakota Renamed for Oglala Lakota Medicine Man | Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/highest-peak-south-dakota-renamed-oglala-lakota-medicine-man-180960133/#:~:text=Harney%20Peak%27s%20name%20came%20from,conducted%20a%20raid%20on%20a)). The U.S. Board on Geographic Names voted unanimously for the change. Local Lakota people had long objected to the Harney name, noting that General Harney earned the nickname “Woman Killer” among the Lakota for his role in an 1855 massacre ([Highest Peak in South Dakota Renamed for Oglala Lakota Medicine Man | Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/highest-peak-south-dakota-renamed-oglala-lakota-medicine-man-180960133/#:~:text=peak%2C%20as%C2%A0James%20Nord%20reports%20at,among%20the%20Lakota)). The new name pays tribute to a Native leader and the sacred significance of the Black Hills, rather than a perpetrator of violence. This precedent shows that even long-standing names can be changed when they glorify the wrong history.

- **Removing Racial Slurs from Maps** – In 2022, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland (the first Native American cabinet secretary) launched a nationwide initiative to replace derogatory place names, particularly the offensive term “squaw” (a slur for Indigenous women). *“Racist terms have no place in our vernacular or on our federal lands,”* Haaland declared ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=Last%20November%2C%20Interior%20Secretary%20Deb,perpetuate%20the%20legacies%20of%20oppression)). Under her order, a federal task force identified and renamed over 650 geographic features that contained the word “squaw” ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=Last%20November%2C%20Interior%20Secretary%20Deb,perpetuate%20the%20legacies%20of%20oppression)) ([What's in a Name?

This is one of the largest systematic renaming efforts in U.S. history, affirming that language matters. The initiative’s rationale was that such names *“perpetuate the legacies of oppression”* and that changing them is a step toward *“a more truthful and unified future.”* ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20It%20Means%20to,Decolonize%20a%20Natural%20Feature)) ([What's in a Name?

- **Restoring Indigenous Names** – Many towns and landmarks have opted to revive indigenous names or remove colonial ones. For instance, the city of Barrow, Alaska, voted in 2016 to restore its traditional Inupiaq name **Utqiaġvik**. In Oregon, the city of Verona was renamed **Keizer** to remove a Confederate name (though not indigenous, it’s an example of addressing problematic legacy). On a smaller scale, numerous parks, lakes, and streets have been renamed to honor Native history instead of colonizers – for example, in Minnesota, Lake Calhoun (named for a pro-slavery official) was restored to **Bde Maka Ska**, its Dakota Sioux name ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=And%20there%20are%2C%20of%20course%2C,of%20some%20who%20actively%20worked)) ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=Four%20centuries%20of%20colonialism%20are,the%20extermination%20of%20Indigenous%20people)). Each of these changes was driven by local communities reckoning with history and choosing a more inclusive identity.

These precedents illustrate a clear trend: **when a place’s name no longer reflects contemporary values or historical truth, change is possible**. Falls Church’s situation is analogous. The city’s current name honors a colonial-era church and by extension the colonial system – including the exclusion of Native Americans and the enslavement of African Americans – that built that church. By renaming the city **Little Falls**, Falls Church would join the ranks of communities choosing to confront their past and tell a more complete story. It would be a proactive step, much like Denali or Black Elk Peak, to prefer an *older*, more authentic name over a colonial one. Importantly, “Little Falls” is not an arbitrary new label; it is the very geographic reference that gave the church its name in the first place ([Little Falls (Potomac River) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Falls_(Potomac_River)#:~:text=the%20Potomac%20as%20far%20as,referenced%20this%20location%20near%20the)). Thus, one can argue this is less a “name change” and more a **name correction**, realigning the city’s identity with the true historical origin.

## Conclusion  
Renaming Falls Church to **Little Falls** is not about erasing history – it’s about *illuminating* history that has too long been in the shadows. Our investigation shows that the name “Falls Church” commemorates a colonial church founded “near the falls” ([Early History | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/earlyhistory#:~:text=The%20name%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Falls%20Church%2C%E2%80%9D,it%20was%20incorporated%20in%201948)), but in doing so it inadvertently celebrates the colonial regime that came with it. That regime, represented by men like Colonel James Wren and his vestry peers, brought enslavement, exclusion, and the silencing of Indigenous voices. Meanwhile, the **Little Falls** of the Potomac, an ancient meeting place of peoples, remains an overlooked footnote in the city’s identity. By renaming the city Little Falls, we center the narrative on a neutral, natural feature that honors the region’s full history – **Indigenous, colonial, and beyond**.

Such a change would carry profound symbolic weight. It would acknowledge that the story of this land did not begin in 1734 with a tobacco-funded Anglican chapel, but stretches back thousands of years to Native American inhabitants by the river’s falls ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Until%20the%20late%201600s%2C%20the,trails%20from%20here%20to%20the)) ([](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8930/Falls-Church-History-Panels#:~:text=Little%20and%20Great%20Falls,%E2%80%9D%20%2F692)). It also offers a form of reconciliation: a way to remember those who were marginalized by the colonial era (the displaced tribes and the enslaved laborers). As the Sierra Club’s report on decolonizing place names notes, *“the ability to name a place is a form of power”* – for centuries, colonial powers imposed their names and in doing so inscribed their values on the land ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=imposed%20the%20names%20of%20their,nations%E2%80%94Washington%2C%20Jefferson%2C%20Custer%2C%20Carson%2C%20Jackson)). Renaming is an act of taking that power back. It is, in the words of Secretary Haaland, part of *“not perpetuating the legacies of oppression”* ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=process%20to%20review%20and%20replace,perpetuate%20the%20legacies%20of%20oppression)) but instead **righting historical wrongs**. 

Practically, the name “Little Falls” is rooted in local heritage and is easy for residents to connect with – there’s already a Little Falls Street, a Little Falls branch of the Potomac, and the term appears in early records of the area ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=Indian%20trails%20meandered%20past%20the,trails%20became%20important%20transportation%20routes)) ([Little Falls (Potomac River) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Falls_(Potomac_River)#:~:text=the%20Potomac%20as%20far%20as,referenced%20this%20location%20near%20the)). Adopting it as the city’s name would strengthen the community’s link to the land itself, rather than to a single building. Falls Church is proud of its historic church (as it should be), but a city is more than one church. By embracing “Little Falls,” the city can present itself as a place that values **inclusivity and historical honesty** over tradition for tradition’s sake. It echoes the actions of other American locales that have moved away from names honoring colonizers, enslavers, or outdated narratives in favor of names that reflect justice and the **true character of the place** ([What's in a Name? What It Means to Decolonize a Natural Feature. | Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/feature/whats-name-what-it-means-decolonize-natural-feature#:~:text=Image%3A%20What%20It%20Means%20to,Decolonize%20a%20Natural%20Feature)).

In conclusion, the evidence assembled – from colonial documents and vestry records to Native American history and modern renaming campaigns – strongly supports the case for renaming Falls Church to Little Falls. This change would honor the *original* reason the area was notable (the falls and crossroads of cultures), acknowledge the people who were here first, and align with a nationwide effort to re-examine the messages our place names send. It’s a chance for the city to live up to its ideals by shedding a colonial name and stepping into a broader, more inclusive identity. Just as the Declaration of Independence was once read aloud on the steps of The Falls Church in 1776 ([Falls Church Chapter NSDAR, Falls Church, Virginia: History of the Falls Church](http://fallschurchdar.blogspot.com/p/history-of-falls-church.html#:~:text=During%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War%2C,steps%20of%20the%20south%20doors)), declaring a new era, today Falls Church can declare a new chapter for itself – one that respects **all** of its history and looks forward with hope, as **Little Falls, Virginia**.
