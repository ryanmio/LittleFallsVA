# Mildred “Midge” Wang (1933–2024): Preserving Falls Church’s Heritage

Mildred “Midge” Wang was a leading figure in Falls Church’s historic preservation community, known for her tireless efforts to safeguard and celebrate the city’s past. A resident of Falls Church from 1963 until her death in 2024, Wang wore many civic hats over the decades: long-time board member of the Village Preservation & Improvement Society (VPIS), co-founder of the Victorian Society at Falls Church, 20-year veteran of the Falls Church Historical Commission, and enthusiastic organizer of historical events. Through these roles, she helped install historical markers and interpretive signs across the city, organized living-history tours in period costume, and even restored and lived in **Mount Hope**, the city’s oldest residence ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20City%20historian%20Midge,Grand%20Marshal%20on%C2%A0Monday%2C%20May%2028)) ([Mount Hope (Falls Church, Virginia) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hope_(Falls_Church,_Virginia)#:~:text=The%201831%20wing%20of%20the,on%20the%20local%20mail%20route)). Wang’s even-keeled but passionate advocacy left an indelible mark on Falls Church’s civic identity, inspiring greater public awareness of local history even as the “Little City” evolved amid development pressures.

## Civic Leadership in Preservation (VPIS and Beyond)

Wang emerged as a key civic leader in Falls Church through her long involvement with the **Village Preservation & Improvement Society (VPIS)** – one of the city’s oldest civic groups, dedicated to beautification and historic preservation. She served on the VPIS Board for nearly twenty years ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=Wang%20served%20on%20the%20Board,according%20to%20another%20nomination%20letter)), helping guide its programs to protect the character and “village” feel of Falls Church neighborhoods. In this capacity, Wang was instrumental in projects like the Victorian-inspired restoration of **Frady Park**, a small historic park in the city’s center. She was the driving force behind adding a **Victorian-style gazebo, tiered fountain, and formal garden** features to Frady Park in the early 2000s, working with city staff to realize a “Victorian vision” for the public space ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=Wang%20served%20on%20the%20Board,according%20to%20another%20nomination%20letter)) ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=As%20one%20nomination%20letter%20describes%2C,%E2%80%9D)). According to one account, she personally helped **raise private funds** for the park’s decorative fountain and other elements ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=Wang%20served%20on%20the%20Board,according%20to%20another%20nomination%20letter)) ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=As%20one%20nomination%20letter%20describes%2C,%E2%80%9D)). These improvements not only beautified the city but also reinforced its historical ambiance. Longtime colleagues note that Wang’s leadership style was hands-on and collaborative – she was equally comfortable strategizing in board meetings and rolling up her sleeves at park clean-ups or plantings.

Beyond VPIS, Wang lent her leadership to several other organizations devoted to local heritage. She was a member of **Historic Falls Church, Inc.**, a nonprofit formed to save historic buildings, and a member of the City’s Arts and Humanities Council ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=Wang%20served%20on%20the%20Board,according%20to%20another%20nomination%20letter)). In 1995, she co-founded the **Victorian Society at Falls Church**, broadening her advocacy from general beautification to a focused celebration of the city’s Victorian-era legacy ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20nexus%20between%20the,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)) ([Obituary information for Adelaide Wang - Everly Funeral Home](https://www.everlyfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Adelaide-Wang?obId=34325342#:~:text=Home%20www,Program%20Chair%20for%20the)). Through these overlapping roles, Wang became, in effect, an unofficial city historian. In 2018 the Falls Church News-Press even dubbed her “the City’s longest-tenured historian” and affectionately the “Godmother of Falls Church” for her decades of service ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=She%20may%20be%20slight%20and,Memorial%20Day%20Parade%20and%20Festival)).

## Founding the Victorian Society and Heritage Events

One of Wang’s signature achievements was co-founding the **Victorian Society at Falls Church** in 1995, a group dedicated to preserving and sharing the history of the Victorian era (c. 1837–1901) in Falls Church ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20nexus%20between%20the,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)) ([F.C. Victorian Society Working to Preserve Heritage of Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/03/03/f-c-victorian-society-working-to-preserve-heritage-of-little-city/#:~:text=Impressive%2C%20given%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20been,this%20history%20before%20their%20formation)). Wang served on the Society’s board and as its program chair from its inception for the remainder of her life ([Obituary information for Adelaide Wang - Everly Funeral Home](https://www.everlyfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Adelaide-Wang?obId=34325342#:~:text=Home%20www,Program%20Chair%20for%20the)), energetically shaping its activities. Under her guidance, the Victorian Society became known for imaginative **living history programs** – members would don 19th-century costumes and reenact scenes from local history, from Civil War civilian life to Gilded Age social gatherings. “It was such an elegant time,” Wang once said wistfully of the Victorian period, “all the gentility…” ([Victorian Echoes: Falls Church | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/travel/victorian-echoes/#:~:text=Midge%20Wang%2C%20in%20her%2070s%2C,says%20wistfully%2C%20%E2%80%9Call%20the%20gentility)). She believed that emphasizing this era allowed residents “to see the significance of the cultural lineage” of the modern city ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20nexus%20between%20the,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)) ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=Civil%20War%20and%20its%20effects,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)).

Wang’s flair for creative public history was evident in the annual heritage events she launched. Notably, she organized the first **“Church and Tavern Day,”** a living-history festival that brought the 18th and 19th centuries to life on the grounds of The Falls Church (the city’s namesake colonial church) and a nearby tavern site. This event, which interpreted the old Rolling Road and life in a bygone Falls Church village, later evolved into the city’s official **Civil War Day** commemoration ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Midge Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/midge-wang#:~:text=Historical%20Commission%20member%20for%2020,years)) ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Midge Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/midge-wang#:~:text=Organized%20%E2%80%9CChurch%20and%20Tavern%20Day%2C%E2%80%9D,became%20Civil%20War%20Day%20commemoration)). Every spring, Cherry Hill Park would transform as **Civil War reenactors** and costumed townspeople (often including Wang herself) portrayed life during the 1860s ([Photo Gallery: Falls Church Marks Civil War Day - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/28/photo-gallery-falls-church-marks-civil-war-day/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20celebrated%20American%20history,reenactments%20at%20Cherry%20Hill%20Park)) ([Photo Gallery: Falls Church Marks Civil War Day - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/28/photo-gallery-falls-church-marks-civil-war-day/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20celebrated%20American%20history,Gary%20Mester%2C%20Courtesy%20Diane%20Morse)). Under Wang’s direction, these events blended education and entertainment – visitors might encounter Union soldiers drilling, women in hoop skirts chatting on farmhouse porches, or famed figures like Thaddeus Lowe (the Union balloonist) giving “interviews” ([Photo Gallery: Falls Church Marks Civil War Day - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2009/05/28/photo-gallery-falls-church-marks-civil-war-day/#:~:text=16%20with%20a%20series%20of,Gary%20Mester%2C%20Courtesy%20Diane%20Morse)). Such interactive programs were not commonplace when Wang introduced them in the mid-1990s; “having historic re-enactors may seem normal [today], but it was Midge that introduced it” in Falls Church, noted one nomination letter for a city honor ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=As%20a%20member%20of%20the,1990s)). By pioneering costumed tours and festivals, Wang made local history accessible and fun for all ages. 

## Twenty Years on the Historical Commission

Another pillar of Wang’s legacy was her **20-year tenure on the Falls Church Historical Commission**. Appointed in 1994, she served actively until 2015, when she retired from the commission after “more than 20 years (Nov 1994 – Aug 2015) of active involvement” ([FALLS CHURCH HISTORICAL COMMISSION](http://www.fallschurchva.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/01282016-704#:~:text=R,and%20will%20also%20look%20into)). As a commissioner, Wang was a leader in researching historical sites and finding ways to **interpret them for the public**. She spearheaded the establishment of numerous **local historical markers**, personally designing many of the signs and even helping to raise funds for their fabrication ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=Wang%20owns%20and%20lives%20in,conceived%2C%20researched%20and%20helped%20produce)) ([Obituary information for Adelaide Wang - Everly Funeral Home](https://www.everlyfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Adelaide-Wang?obId=34325342#:~:text=Obituary%20information%20for%20Adelaide%20Wang,the%20local%20historic%20markers)). Walk through Falls Church and you will encounter plaques and interpretive panels at key locations – from the old Columbia Baptist Church site to Cherry Hill Farmhouse – thanks in large part to Wang’s efforts. One marker stands literally in her front yard: a plaque at **Mount Hope**, Wang’s own home, explaining its significance ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=homes%20in%20the%20City.)) ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=Wang%20owns%20and%20lives%20in,conceived%2C%20researched%20and%20helped%20produce)). Most of these markers were incorporated into a **“Victorian Map” walking tour** of Falls Church that Wang conceived and researched ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=as%20rich%20in%20history%20as,City%20that%20Wang%20conceived%2C%20researched)). The map and markers encourage residents and visitors to explore dozens of 19th-century properties scattered around the 2.2-square-mile city, thereby keeping local history visible amid the modern landscape.

Wang also worked to place Falls Church on broader heritage trails. She was instrumental in getting the city included in the **Virginia Civil War Trails** program, which installed interpretive signs linking Falls Church to the statewide Civil War history network ([Obituary information for Adelaide Wang - Everly Funeral Home](https://www.everlyfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Adelaide-Wang?obId=34325342#:~:text=Home%20www,Falls%20Church%20in%20the)). This was a natural extension of her earlier work turning Church and Tavern Day into Civil War Day. On the Commission, she consistently advocated for recognizing **African American and Civil War history**, preservation of remaining old structures, and documentation of historic sites before they were lost to redevelopment. Former colleagues recall that Wang approached this work with equal parts passion and practicality. She had a talent for building consensus – whether convincing City Hall to approve a marker’s text or persuading homeowners to share their property’s story. In sum, her two decades on the Historical Commission ensured that Falls Church’s “built history” was catalogued and celebrated with tangible markers and trails.

## Preserving **Mount Hope**: Saving the City’s Oldest House

 ([File:Mount Hope front.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mount_Hope_front.jpg)) **Mount Hope, Wang’s home, is a Gothic Revival house whose earliest wing (built c.1830) is the oldest surviving residential building in Falls Church ([Mount Hope (Falls Church, Virginia) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hope_(Falls_Church,_Virginia)#:~:text=The%201831%20wing%20of%20the,on%20the%20local%20mail%20route)).** Wang and her family purchased Mount Hope (located on South Oak Street) in the 1960s and lovingly restored it, transforming it into both a family home and a showcase of Victorian-era design ([Falls Church house epitomizes Victorian style | Victorian homes, Victorian parlor, Victorian interiors](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/187180928248395255/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20house%20epitomizes%20Victorian,style)). With its brick gables, pointed Gothic windows, and sweeping porch, Mount Hope stands out – and under Wang’s care, it became a time capsule of 19th-century life. She maintained the interior in **strict Victorian style**, down to period-appropriate furnishings and décor ([Falls Church house epitomizes Victorian style | Victorian homes, Victorian parlor, Victorian interiors](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/187180928248395255/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20house%20epitomizes%20Victorian,style)). A visitor’s nomination letter once described Mount Hope’s “wonderful garden and interior as rich in history as any museum” ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=Wang%20owns%20and%20lives%20in,City%20that%20Wang%20conceived%2C%20researched)). By preserving Mount Hope when many similar houses were being razed or remodeled beyond recognition, Wang set an example of **personal historic preservation**. 

Her stewardship of Mount Hope did not go unnoticed. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 ([Mount Hope (Falls Church, Virginia) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hope_(Falls_Church,_Virginia)#:~:text=Amzi%20Coe%20purchased%20the%20residence,Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20the%20parlor)), and Wang frequently opened it up for home and garden tours. She welcomed Victorian Society members, students, and history buffs to visit and learn from the house itself. In fact, the Victorian Society’s early meetings often convened in Mount Hope’s parlor ([F.C. Victorian Society Working to Preserve Heritage of Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/03/03/f-c-victorian-society-working-to-preserve-heritage-of-little-city/#:~:text=A%20power%20clique%20had%20assembled,progressive%20identity%20that%20defines%20it)), surrounded by antiques and ambience. The home served as a living classroom where Wang could literally “bring history home” to the community. It also anchored the **South Oak Street Historic District**, demonstrating how old homes could remain beautiful and livable in the modern era. As development intensified in Falls Church, Mount Hope’s survival was in part a credit to Wang’s dedication. By keeping the property in historic condition, she ensured that the city’s oldest house continued to tell its stories.

## Engaging the Public through Living History

Wang had a special gift for **bringing history to life**. Rather than confining history to books or archives, she believed in taking it to the streets – and the parks, farmhouses, and school auditoriums – to engage the public. One of her hallmark techniques was organizing **costumed historical tours** and reenactments. Whether playing the role of a Victorian hostess at Cherry Hill Farmhouse or guiding walking tours in a 19th-century dress and bonnet, Wang embraced a bit of theater in her educational efforts. She and her fellow volunteers would “dress in the garb [of the era] and portray the events” of Falls Church’s past, making learning immersive and fun ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=She%20chats%20politely%20but%20proudly,graciousness%20that%20defined%20the%20time)) ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=about%20how%20much%20fun%20it,graciousness%20that%20defined%20the%20time)). During Victorian Society events, Wang often appeared in elaborate period gowns, complete with vintage hats and gloves, delighting attendees both young and old. Even as she entered her 70s and 80s, she continued these portrayals – politely and proudly chatting about Falls Church history while fully costumed, as if a character stepping out of time ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=Wang%E2%80%99s%20affinity%20for%20the%20era,It%E2%80%99s%20very%20Victorian%20of%20her)).

This creative approach paid off in sustained public interest. The **Cherry Hill Farmhouse**, an 1845 house museum in the city, became a vibrant hub of activity in part due to Wang’s efforts. In the mid-1990s she helped establish a **living-history program** at Cherry Hill, recruiting military and civilian reenactors to populate the farmhouse and grounds during special events ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=Wang%20is%20a%20member%20of,states%20one%20nomination%20letter)) ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=As%20a%20member%20of%20the,1990s)). “Twenty years later, having historic re-enactors may seem normal, but it was Midge that introduced it” to Falls Church ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=As%20a%20member%20of%20the,1990s)). From **parlor concerts and Victorian teas to Civil War encampments**, these programs offered residents a chance to experience local history firsthand. Wang also gave countless **lectures and guided tours**, often in partnership with the Falls Church library and schools, sharing her encyclopedic knowledge of the city’s “remarkable 300-year history” ([Victorian Echoes: Falls Church | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/travel/victorian-echoes/#:~:text=development,nation%E2%80%99s%20most%20dynamic%20metropolitan%20areas)) ([Victorian Echoes: Falls Church | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/travel/victorian-echoes/#:~:text=own%20city%20manager,as%20being%20a%20private%2C%20family)). Importantly, she always strove to connect history with the present. For example, while leading a tour, she might point out how a tranquil park had once been an overgrown Civil War camp, or how a currently bustling street emerged from the post-war Victorian boom ([F.C. Victorian Society Working to Preserve Heritage of Little City - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/03/03/f-c-victorian-society-working-to-preserve-heritage-of-little-city/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20after%20the%20Civil,%E2%80%9D)) ([F.C.

By using storytelling and visual cues, Wang helped neighbors appreciate that **“the Falls Church they know and love” is deeply rooted in the past ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=Civil%20War%20and%20its%20effects,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of))**.

## Legacy and Impact Amid Development Pressures

Midge Wang’s impact on Falls Church is evident in the city’s enhanced historical awareness and the preservation of many landmarks that might otherwise have vanished. Her contemporaries frequently lauded her “lifelong dedication” to the city ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=The%20City%E2%80%99s%20Recreation%20and%20Parks,public%20use%20of%20Frady%20Park)). In 2018, the City selected her as the **Grand Marshal of the Memorial Day Parade**, citing her extensive work in “preservation, restoration and education” regarding Falls Church’s historic properties ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=The%20City%E2%80%99s%20Recreation%20and%20Parks,public%20use%20of%20Frady%20Park)). The honor – one of many awards Wang received – symbolized how much Falls Church came to value its heritage, thanks in large part to her advocacy. The mayor at that time noted that **historic houses and parks had become “part of the fabric of the City”** because of Wang’s efforts to raise awareness ([Midge Wang Named Memorial Day Parade Grand Marshal | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/midge-wang-named-memorial-day-parade-grand-marshal#:~:text=,historic%20homes%20in%20the%20City)) ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20think%20that%20all%20the,%E2%80%9D)). Generations of students learned local lore through the programs she started, and community events like Civil War Day remain popular traditions.

At the same time, Wang’s career unfolded during a period of rapid change in Falls Church. Starting in the early 2000s, the city pursued aggressive **mixed-use development** to boost its tax base ([Victorian Echoes: Falls Church | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/travel/victorian-echoes/#:~:text=Now%2C%20though%2C%20change%20is%20coming,use%20development.%E2%80%9D)) ([Victorian Echoes: Falls Church | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/travel/victorian-echoes/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20talk%20in%20Falls,density%20%5Bspace%5D%2C%E2%80%9D%20says)). New condos and commercial projects sprang up, putting pressure on older buildings and the “small-town” character. Wang did not shy away from this context; instead, she became a thoughtful voice urging balance between progress and preservation. She expressed concern that City Hall, in its zeal for revenue, was too “lenient about giving people the right to tear down a [historic] house and rebuild it twice as big” for profit ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20City%E2%80%99s%20interest%20in%20getting,%E2%80%9D)). “Many of them don’t respect the historical aspect,” she observed of the tear-down trend, lamenting a cultural shift she saw in some quarters of the community ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20City%E2%80%99s%20interest%20in%20getting,%E2%80%9D)). Wang conceded that old Victorian homes lack some modern amenities, but she argued they “can’t be discarded so casually for the sake of a quick buck” ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=Wang%20concedes%20that%20Victorian%20homes,sake%20of%20a%20quick%20buck)). This perspective sometimes put her at odds with developers or even younger families looking for larger new homes. Yet even those who prioritized growth recognized the value in preserving a link to the past. Wang’s emphasis on the Victorian era as Falls Church’s formative period helped frame the debate: development could proceed, but with an eye to **honoring the city’s “cultural lineage” and unique heritage** ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20nexus%20between%20the,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)) ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=Civil%20War%20and%20its%20effects,lineage%20it%E2%80%99s%20grown%20out%20of)).

In her later years, Wang became something of a civic institution herself – the person people would turn to for historical context at ribbon-cuttings, or to consult on what year a house was built. Her humility, however, remained intact. Upon being named Grand Marshal, she professed to be “appalled to be selected,” insisting “lots of other people…do wonderful things” too ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20came%20as%20a%20total,%E2%80%9D)) ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=grandchild%20will%20be%20in%20attendance%29,%E2%80%9D)). That gracious spirit characterized her approach: she saw herself as one steward of history among many. Indeed, Wang was quick to credit **community teamwork** for preservation successes, from scout troops who helped with cemetery clean-ups to City staff who assisted with marker installations.

Midge Wang passed away in December 2024 at the age of 91, leaving behind a city much more conscious of its heritage than when she found it. Her legacy can be read in the physical landscape – the preserved farmhouse, the plaques and maps, the Victorian garden in Frady Park – and felt in the civic ethos that treasures those reminders of “old” Falls Church. There have been debates about how best to carry that legacy forward. Some in the community question how to engage younger residents in history, a challenge Wang herself acknowledged ([Wang Humbly Obliges Request to be Grand Marshal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/05/25/wang-humbly-obliges-request-grand-marshal/#:~:text=While%20Wang%20will%20have%20to,more%20justice%20in%20her%20eyes)). Others note that as development continues, constant vigilance is needed to protect remaining historic sites. But few dispute that **Falls Church’s strong historic identity** today is due in large measure to Midge Wang’s vision and persistence. As one admirer wrote, she exemplified a “generous spirit” in service of her hometown ([Wang Named Grand Marshal for Annual Memorial Day Parade - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/04/06/wang-named-grand-marshal-annual-memorial-day-parade/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTwenty%20years%20later%2C%E2%80%9D%20reads%20one,%E2%80%9D)). With even-handed determination rather than fanfare, she ensured that the story of Falls Church – from colonial times through the Victorian rebirth and beyond – will continue to be told for years to come.
