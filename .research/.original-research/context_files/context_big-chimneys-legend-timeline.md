# The Legend of Falls Church's "Big Chimneys": A Historical Timeline

## 1904 – Earliest Published Mention (Stewart's *A Virginia Village*)  
Falls Church's first known reference to an "old big chimney house" appears in 1904. Local author Charles A. Stewart described "the old big chimney house situated in the field opposite the Odd Fellows' Hall" as having been built "in Revolutionary times" and "probably the oldest dwelling in this vicinity" {{< cite url="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30054/30054-h/30054-h.htm#:~:text=The%20old%20big%20chimney%20house,now%20a%20resident%20of%20Maryland" title="The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart" >}}. Stewart identified the owner as John Lynch (a long-time church sexton) and noted the house was still standing in 1904 {{< cite url="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30054/30054-h/30054-h.htm#:~:text=The%20old%20big%20chimney%20house,now%20a%20resident%20of%20Maryland" title="The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart" >}}. **Context:** Stewart's book was a promotional local history highlighting Falls Church's heritage and amenities. At this time, the house was remembered simply as a very old residence – there was **no mention of any 1699 date stone** or a legendary founding date. Stewart's account suggests an actual log house with large chimneys existed, but he only traced it back to the late 18th century, indicating that the **1699 date was not yet part of the narrative**.

## 1907 – "Big Chimneys" Enters Local Lore as a Tavern  
By 1907, the name *"Big Chimneys"* was being used in print, and the building's story had evolved into one of colonial significance. An account written in 1907 (later quoted by historians) refers to **"the Big Chimneys Tavern"** as a stop on an early postal route {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/244" title="Falls Church Big Chimneys Park Master Plan" >}}. It notes that in colonial days, mail riders stopped at Mt. Hope (another old house) and "at this same time the Big Chimneys Tavern was a stopping place for mail riders," even serving as the Falls Church post office after 1850 {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/244" title="Falls Church Big Chimneys Park Master Plan" >}}. **Context & Purpose:** This turn-of-the-century description, likely published in a local newspaper or newsletter, introduced *Big Chimneys* as a landmark of early travel and communication. The emphasis on an "earliest known stopping place" suggests a bit of civic pride – Falls Church could claim a role in colonial-era mail service. Still, in 1907 the story **focused on the house as an old inn/tavern** from the  eighteenth or early 19th century. Notably, **no 1699 founding date is mentioned**; the significance lies in its age and function on the post road.

## Mid-20th Century (1930s–1960s) – Growth of the Myth and Additional Legends  
Over the decades, local tradition around Big Chimneys continued to grow, even without documentary evidence. By the mid-20th century, the Falls Church community had largely accepted that *"Big Chimneys"* was the **first house in Falls Church**, dating all the way back to **1699**. The story also accrued colorful details and even ties to national history: 

- **War of 1812 Legend:** A local lore emerged that during the British invasion of 1814, *Big Chimneys* was searched by British troops who thought President Madison might be hiding there {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1541/Big-Chimneys-Park" title="Big Chimneys Park | Falls Church, VA - Official Website" >}}. This anecdote was conveyed to later historians by residents like Miss Ada Walker, though it appears to be entirely anecdotal. It positioned the old house as a place of refuge during the burning of Washington – a way to link Falls Church to a dramatic national event. There are no contemporary 1814 records of this search; it was **a story passed down orally** and first documented in the 20th-century reminiscences.

- **Romanticized Descriptions:** Local historian Jeanne Johnson Rust's work, *All-American Crossroads* (privately printed in 1970), presents one of the most detailed (and idealized) descriptions of Big Chimneys. She writes that the log cabin with two immense brick chimneys was **"built in Falls Church in 1699"**, serving as an ordinary (inn) for travelers {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/13046" title="Falls Church History Timeline" >}}. Rust describes the cabin in loving detail – whitewashed logs, roses climbing the chimneys, boxwood gardens, and even birdhouses carved into the gateposts {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/13046" title="Falls Church History Timeline" >}}. She also repeats that *"a date stone in one of the twenty-foot chimneys had the date 1699 carved on it"* {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/13046" title="Falls Church History Timeline" >}}. Additionally, Rust notes that when *Big Chimneys* was finally dismantled in the early 1900s, bricks from its huge chimneys were reused in local African American families' homes – symbolically keeping the bricks "at home" with descendants of those who once labored there {{< cite url="https://fallschurchhistory.org/history/" title="Falls Church History" >}}. **Context & Purpose:** By the time of Rust's writing, the *Big Chimneys* tale had become a point of civic heritage. Her 1970 narrative was intended to celebrate Falls Church's tricentennial roots (she explicitly says the town's "initiative goes back to…when it began to develop in the first part of the 1700s" {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/13046" title="Falls Church History Timeline" >}}). In doing so, Rust and other mid-century historians **fully embraced the 1699 date as fact**, using it to assert that Falls Church "came into existence" at the turn of the 18th century. The story was now entrenched: *Big Chimneys* was no longer just an old house, but the **mythic birthplace of the Falls Church community**, complete with a founding year carved in stone. Any skepticism about evidence was minimal – Rust acknowledges the date stone story as something "said to" be true {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1541/Big-Chimneys-Park" title="Big Chimneys Park | Falls Church, VA - Official Website" >}}, but proceeds as if it likely is. The legend was repeated for purposes of **civic pride** and to give Falls Church a venerable colonial-era origin akin to neighboring communities.

## 1964 – First Documented Appearance of the "1699" Date
A critical turning point in the Big Chimneys legend appears to be the publication of Melvin Lee Steadman's *Falls Church By Fence and Fireside* in 1964. This work included a drawing of Big Chimneys clearly showing "1699" on the chimney {{< cite url="https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359" title="Falls Church Historical Commission Memorandum, April 12, 2019" >}}. This appears to be the first documented visual representation of the "1699" date, despite the structure being demolished decades earlier. The Falls Church Historical Commission later noted that Steadman's book is "the source of the famous Big Chimneys drawing with '1699' on the chimney" {{< cite url="https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359" title="Falls Church Historical Commission Memorandum, April 12, 2019" >}}. This publication preceded Rust's detailed descriptions and likely influenced her account and subsequent historical narratives.

## 1992 – Tricentennial Plans Based on the Legend  
In 1992, city leaders explicitly invoked the *Big Chimneys* legend to justify an upcoming anniversary. The Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS) proposed celebrating **"the 300th anniversary in 1999 of the settlement of the community in 1699."** This date was chosen *"on the basis of a verbal account of a stone bearing the date '1699' on a chimney in the 'Big Chimneys' house"* {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/244" title="Falls Church Big Chimneys Park Master Plan" >}}. In other words, the entire tricentennial celebration was predicated on local lore: that an unnamed settler built a house in 1699 at the site of Falls Church's future village. **Context:** By the late 20th century, the City of Falls Church had essentially canonized 1699 as the founding year – *fully aware that this was based on tradition rather than documented history*. The VPIS and City Council, while planning the tricentennial, treated the Big Chimneys story as a **"cherished local tradition"** and the best available date to celebrate {{< cite url="https://fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/194/Falls-Church-History-for-Newcomers-PDF" title="Falls Church History for Newcomers" >}}. This demonstrates how deeply the tale had penetrated civic life; even without proof, it was used as a rallying point for community identity.

## 1999 – Falls Church's Tricentennial and Historical Publications  
Falls Church went forward with a year-long tricentennial celebration in 1999, explicitly honoring the *Big Chimneys* legend. On August 15, 1999, as part of the festivities, the city **dedicated the supposed site of "Big Chimneys"** as a historic park {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1541/Big-Chimneys-Park" title="Big Chimneys Park | Falls Church, VA - Official Website" >}}. The ceremony was followed by colonial-themed events, underscoring how the **myth was leveraged to create civic events and education**. Also in 1999, a new comprehensive city history – *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited* – was published (commissioned for the tricentennial). Authors Bradley Gernand and Nan Netherton presented the *Big Chimneys* story with a more critical tone, signaling a shift toward careful history even as the city celebrated the legend. In their narrative, they describe the *Big Chimneys* cabin as *"a cherished local tradition"* and note frankly that **"no early deed or other documentation for that land exists nor is a surname known"** for the supposed 1699 settler {{< cite url="https://fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/194/Falls-Church-History-for-Newcomers-PDF" title="Falls Church History for Newcomers" >}}. They recount the legend of the stone marked "1699" and acknowledge that the community has *traditionally accepted* that date as its first settlement {{< cite url="https://fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/194/Falls-Church-History-for-Newcomers-PDF" title="Falls Church History for Newcomers" >}}. Crucially, Gernand and Netherton cite Charles Stewart's 1904 account, pointing out that even in the early 1900s the house was only claimed to date to Revolutionary times {{< cite url="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30054/30054-h/30054-h.htm" title="A Virginia Village by Charles Alexander Stewart" >}}. **Analysis of Shifts:** By 1999, the story of *Big Chimneys* had come full circle – it was firmly woven into Falls Church's identity, yet professional historians were careful to label it a **"legend"** rather than fact. The tricentennial events proceeded *as if* 1699 were the founding year (for example, the City's anniversary logo featured "1699–1999"), but the written history subtly reminded readers that this was celebratory lore. Essentially, Falls Church's leaders and historians struck a balance: honoring the tale for its symbolic value while conceding its tenuous basis in evidence.

## 2000s – Memorialization at Big Chimneys Park  
In the early 21st century, the City of Falls Church solidified the Big Chimneys story in the physical landscape. The small park near South Maple Avenue and West Annandale Road – believed to be near the original cabin site – was officially named **Big Chimneys Park**. Interpretive signs were installed, ensuring visitors learn about the legendary cabin. A Falls Church Historical Commission marker titled *"The Story of Big Chimneys Since 1699"* plainly states that *Big Chimneys*, *"named for its two large brick chimneys,"* is **"believed to have been the first permanent structure"** in what is now the City, and that *"The date of 1699 was inscribed on a stone placed in one chimney"* – the date the house was supposedly built {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1541/Big-Chimneys-Park" title="Big Chimneys Park | Falls Church, VA - Official Website" >}}. It notes that 1699 is the year **"the community of Falls Church traditionally accepts as its beginning."** This language, now on an official sign, mirrors decades of local lore (with careful phrasing like "believed" and "traditionally accepts"). **Context:** The creation of Big Chimneys Park and its signage served to **institutionalize the myth**. Even as modern historians doubt the 1699 claim, the City chose to preserve the story as an important piece of Falls Church folklore. The park's master plan explicitly calls the cabin's date "the year traditionally cited as the date of settlement in Falls Church" {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/244" title="Big Chimneys Park Master Plan" >}}. In effect, the myth of Big Chimneys is treated as heritage: something to be commemorated regardless of its uncertain veracity.

## 2019–2021 – Ongoing Retelling and a Critical Eye  
Recent years have seen a continued retelling of the Big Chimneys tale on city websites and exhibits, alongside a more open acknowledgment of its legendary nature. A 2019 draft city history panel still repeats that a **"log cabin with two large brick chimneys was likely built in 1699"** and *"known as 'Big Chimneys,' the house was the first known European structure in the area"* {{< cite url="https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359" title="Falls Church Historical Exhibits Planning" >}}. Meanwhile, the City's official park webpage (updated 2021 after a renovation) highlights the park's historical significance with the story of *Big Chimneys*. It quotes the Historical Commission's summary about the inscribed 1699 stone and the community's acceptance of that date {{< cite url="https://www.fallschurchva.gov/1541/Big-Chimneys-Park" title="Big Chimneys Park | Falls Church, VA - Official Website" >}}. These modern references show that the story remains alive in Falls Church's public narrative. However, local historians and informed citizens today tend to approach the tale with healthy skepticism. The *Little Falls* heritage project, for example, omits the 1699 cabin from its timeline, focusing only on verifiable events. This suggests a gentle shift: **the legend is honored but often framed as folklore** rather than proven fact.

## **Analysis & Final Assessment:** Fact or Myth?  
Despite over a century of repetition, there is **no hard evidence** that *Big Chimneys* was built in 1699 or even existed in that year. Every reference to the date comes from **oral tradition or second-hand accounts**, not from primary documents. As noted in the city's own history, *"no early deed or other documentation"* supports a 17th-century settlement on that site {{< cite url="https://fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/194/Falls-Church-History-for-Newcomers-PDF" title="Falls Church History for Newcomers" >}}. In fact, known land grants and patents in the Falls Church area did not begin until the early 1700s, and European settlement of inland Northern Virginia was sparse before the 1720s. It's telling that Stewart in 1904 – writing within living memory of the house – made **no mention of a 1699 inscription**. If such a stone existed, surely the "venerable" John Lynch or others would have reported it. The absence of any 19th-century mention strongly suggests the date stone story was a later embellishment. Most likely, as Falls Church developed its civic identity in the late 19th and 20th centuries, residents **ascribed an earlier origin date to their village for prestige**, gradually turning an old log house into a founding saga.

Over time the Big Chimneys story took on a life of its own: expanding from a simple note of an old house, to a full-blown legend of the **first cabin on the frontier, a colonial tavern, a refuge from British soldiers, and the very genesis of Falls Church**. Each retelling – whether for a newspaper, a local history book, or a city celebration – tended to add a layer of significance (and sometimes imaginative detail) to the humble log dwelling. The purposes behind these retellings ranged from genuine local pride and the desire for a tangible link to colonial times, to the pragmatic need for a "founding date" when planning anniversaries and tourism materials.

**Is there a plausible core to the legend?** It's not impossible that an early settler built a cabin in the Falls Church vicinity around 1700 – however, if so, his name and story are lost to time. No known records place a permanent European home at today's Falls Church that early. Given the frontier conditions and absence of legal land titles, such a cabin (if it existed) would have been an isolated outpost at best. The specific **"1699" date is almost certainly mythological**, a convenient round number that was later remembered or invented. It's more plausible that *Big Chimneys* was built in the mid-18th century or later (as Stewart believed), and that its imposing chimneys inspired generations of locals to spin yarns about its antiquity. In sum, *Big Chimneys* stands as a fascinating piece of Falls Church folklore – a mix of a real old cabin and the **myths that a community created around it**. While it is **not supported by documented history**, the legend of the 1699 cabin has undeniably shaped Falls Church's sense of its own past, proving that sometimes local lore can be as influential as fact in the making of community identity.

## Logical Razor Analysis: TL;DR on the 1699 Myth

Applying several logical razors to the Big Chimneys legend yields a clear conclusion about the supposed 1699 founding date:

### Occam's Razor (The simplest explanation is usually correct):
* **Simpler explanation:** The house was built in the Revolutionary era (late 18th century) as Stewart stated in 1904, and the 1699 date was a later embellishment.
* **Complex explanation requiring more assumptions:** An actual 1699 datestone existed but was somehow never mentioned by Stewart in 1904, never photographed despite the building's historical significance, and inexplicably not preserved when the structure was demolished.

### Chronological Razor (Follow the documented timeline):
* **1904:** Charles Stewart dates Big Chimneys to "Revolutionary times" with no mention of 1699
* **1964:** Melvin Lee Steadman first publishes a drawing showing "1699" on the chimney
* **1970:** Jeanne Johnson Rust claims a "date stone in one of the twenty-foot chimneys had the date 1699 carved on it"

The 1699 date is conspicuously absent from any description until the 1960s, more than 50 years after the structure was demolished.

### Missing Evidence Razor (What should exist but doesn't):
* No photographs of the supposed datestone
* No contemporary (pre-demolition) written accounts mentioning the 1699 date
* No preserved artifact of such significant historical value
* No land grants or patents from the 1690s for the Falls Church area

### Cui Bono Razor (Who benefits from this claim):
The 1699 date benefits Falls Church by providing:
* A conveniently round founding date (just before the new century)
* An exceptionally early settlement claim predating many neighboring communities
* A foundation for celebration (the tricentennial)
* A marketable origin story for civic identity

### Conclusion:
The Big Chimneys was almost certainly not built in 1699. The specific "1699" date first appears in the historical record in Steadman's 1964 drawing, followed by Rust's 1970 account. This was approximately 50 years after the structure had been demolished, making verification impossible. The most logical explanation is that the date was either invented or drastically misremembered to create a more distinguished founding date for Falls Church.

The myth became deeply engrained because it served important community functions:
1. It provided a clear, memorable founding date at the cusp of a new century
2. It established Falls Church as one of the earliest settlements in the region
3. It created a tangible origin point for local identity and pride
4. It offered a distinctive story that differentiated Falls Church from neighboring communities
5. It supplied the basis for civic celebrations and commemorations, such as the 1999 tricentennial

In essence, the 1699 date became "true" in a cultural sense regardless of its historical accuracy because it fulfilled crucial sociological and civic needs. The missing datestone, which should have been preserved had it existed, stands as the most compelling evidence that the 1699 claim is mythological rather than factual.
