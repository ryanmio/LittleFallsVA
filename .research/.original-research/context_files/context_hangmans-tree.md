# The Hangman’s Tree of Falls Church: Legend vs. History

## Legend of the Hangman’s Tree  
One of Falls Church’s most storied Civil War legends centers on the **“Hangman’s Tree,”** a massive oak that once stood at West Broad Street and North Virginia Avenue ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20well,Broad%20Street%20and%20Virginia%20Avenue)). According to local lore, during the Civil War Colonel **John S. Mosby** – the Confederate “Gray Ghost” – and his rangers used this tree to **hang Union sympathizers and spies** when they occupied the village ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20tree%20itself%20is%20long,being%20Union%20sympathizers%20or%20spies)). The old oak itself is long gone, but for decades a plaque on a stone marked its spot and retold the grisly tale. The plaque’s inscription (installed by the Falls Church Historical Commission) read in part: “**On this site stood the Hangman’s Tree – according to legend, an old oak used by Col. Mosby to hang Union spies after the Battle of the Peach Orchard during the Civil War**” ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=elsewhere%20along%20W,one%20of%20the%20many%20farms)) ([Close Up of Hangman’s Plaque - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/07/22/close-up-of-hangmans-plaque/)). This lurid story has captured local imagination, yet it turns out the tale is **more myth than fact** ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Except%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20true,%E2%80%9D)) ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20legend%20appears%20to%20simply,be%20a%20legend%2C%20however)).

## Falls Church on the Civil War Front Lines  
Falls Church’s location – just 6–7 miles from Washington, D.C. – made it a strategic outpost in the war ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Located%20just%20six%20miles%20from,hospital%20and%20later%20a%20stable)). In mid-1861, Confederate forces occupied the Falls Church area, establishing forward pickets on Munson’s Hill and Upton’s Hill overlooking Union territory ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Located%20just%20six%20miles%20from,hospital%20and%20later%20a%20stable)). Skirmishes with Union troops broke out frequently. Soldiers later joked that **a “battle of the peach orchard”** raged nearly every day, as opposing pickets traded shots amid the area’s ripe fruit groves ([All Not So Quiet Along the Potomac: The 17th Virginia in Fairfax and Falls Church, August 1861](http://dclawyeronthecivilwar.blogspot.com/2011/08/17th-virginia-in-fairfax-and-falls.html#:~:text=Goree%20recounted%20to%20his%20mother,%28in%20Cutrer%2C%20p.%2035)). (In reality there was no formal “Battle of the Peach Orchard” – just sporadic sniping while foraging ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=elsewhere%20along%20W,one%20of%20the%20many%20farms)).) Falls Church even witnessed an early milestone in military history: in June 1861, Union aeronaut **Thaddeus S. C. Lowe** floated a balloon above **Taylor’s Tavern** on the Leesburg-Alexandria Turnpike near Falls Church, conducting the **first aerial reconnaissance in U.S. military history** ([All Not So Quiet Along the Potomac: The 17th Virginia in Fairfax and Falls Church, August 1861](http://dclawyeronthecivilwar.blogspot.com/2011/08/17th-virginia-in-fairfax-and-falls.html#:~:text=Corners,19%20that%C2%A0Confederate%20pickets%20at%20Falls)). These early-war episodes left an imprint on the village, which changed hands that year – Confederates withdrew by September 1861, and Union forces occupied Falls Church afterward, using its stone church as a hospital and barracks ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Located%20just%20six%20miles%20from,hospital%20and%20later%20a%20stable)). 

By 1864, Falls Church was behind Union lines, but far from peaceful. Many residents who remained were **Union sympathizers**, even forming a small interracial Home Guard to protect the village ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=local%20civilian%20,This%20involved%20the)) ([Living in Fear - The Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=69552#:~:text=Living%20in%20Fear%20,after%20he%20sounded%20the%20alarm)). Meanwhile, Col. **John Singleton Mosby’s** Partisan Rangers roamed Northern Virginia, striking isolated Union outposts and loyalist communities. Mosby’s guerrillas had free rein in much of Fairfax and Loudoun County (an area dubbed “Mosby’s Confederacy”), and by the summer of 1864 they began targeting villages on Washington’s fringes – **including Falls Church** ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Confederate%20Ranger%20Colonel%20John%20S,within%20walking%20distance%20and%20will)).

## Mosby’s 1864 Raid: What Really Happened  
In the dead of night on **October 17, 1864**, about two dozen of Mosby’s raiders galloped into Falls Church along the Middle Turnpike (now Broad Street) ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=Confederate%20Col,near%20where%20you%20are%20standing)). Their mission was punitive: Mosby **hated the local Unionist postmaster, George Ives**, and had openly vowed to capture and execute him ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%20is%20true%2C%20Gernand%20says%2C,%E2%80%9D)) ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20legend%20itself%20possibly%20originated,legend%20of%20the%20Hangman%E2%80%99s%20Tree)). (Ives, a vocal Union loyalist, was exactly the kind of “spy” or informant Mosby wanted to make an example of.) Fortunately for Ives, he was away in Pennsylvania that night ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%20is%20true%2C%20Gernand%20says%2C,%E2%80%9D)) – but Mosby’s men still dealt the village a violent blow. 

As the Confederate horsemen thundered in, a sentry from the Falls Church Home Guard, **Frank Brooks**, raised a trumpet to sound the alarm. Brooks – a Black freedman in the uniquely integrated Home Guard – was **shot and killed on the spot** by the raiders ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls Church Holds a Handful of History](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Confederate%20Ranger%20Colonel%20John%20S,any%20tour%20of%20Falls%20Church)) ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=Mosby%E2%80%99s%20men%20killed%20Frank%20Brooks%2C,gunshot%20wound%20but%20lost%20an)). Mosby’s men then broke into the home of **John Read**, a white Falls Church resident who was an abolitionist lay minister and Home Guard member ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=Mosby%E2%80%99s%20men%20killed%20Frank%20Brooks%2C,Read%20assuring%20the%20safety%20of)). Read was known for teaching local enslaved and freed people to read and write – an act which had earned him the enmity of secessionists ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=ear,used%20to%20do%20what%20we)). The rangers **abducted John Read**, along with another African American man, **Jacob Jackson**, and dragged them off into the darkness at gunpoint ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=Mosby%E2%80%99s%20men%20killed%20Frank%20Brooks%2C,Read%20assuring%20the%20safety%20of)). 

The captives were taken about ten miles away toward **Hunter’s Mill** near Vienna. There, Mosby’s men **executed John Read** – shooting him and mutilating his body (Jackson was left wounded, minus an ear, but managed to survive) ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=African%20American%20Jacob%20Jackson,and%20because)). In a chilling epilogue, Mosby sent word back to Falls Church the next day, directing Read’s wife **Charlotte** to where she could find her husband’s body ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=not%20know%20who%20they%20are,used%20to%20do%20what%20we)). Charlotte recovered John’s remains and buried him in the Falls Church Episcopal churchyard, where his grave (beside hers) can still be seen ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=After%20kidnapping%20and%20murdering%20Read%2C,cemetery%20at%20Falls%20Church%20Episcopal)). Mosby’s men claimed Read had been a Union spy, though Charlotte believed he was targeted **“because he served in the Union Home Guard and because he taught Sabbath school to the colored people and befriended them”** ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=ear,used%20to%20do%20what%20we)). 

This **brutal October 1864 raid** is the only documented Civil War execution in Falls Church – and notably, it did *not* involve any hangings at the big oak on Broad Street ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=occupying%20troops,subject%20of%20a%20Civil%20War)). Mosby’s raid left the community shaken and earned a fearful nickname: a Civil War Trails historical marker titled **“Living in Fear”** now stands on West Broad, describing how Falls Church residents lived under threat from Mosby’s sudden strikes ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=Confederate%20Col,near%20where%20you%20are%20standing)) ([Living In Fear - Historic Markers – Visit Falls Church](https://visitfallschurch.com/directory-things_to_do/listing/living-in-fear/#:~:text=African%20American%20Jacob%20Jackson,and%20because)). The memory of that frightening night would linger for years in local folklore.

## Fact vs. Folklore: Unraveling the Hangman’s Tale  
Given the very real terror Mosby inflicted, it’s easy to see how legends grew in Falls Church. Yet historians have found **no evidence** that anyone was ever hanged from the Broad Street oak during the war. Both Mosby’s own records *and* Union Army accounts **make no mention of any hangings in Falls Church** ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=Mosby%20and%20his%20men%20consistently,in%20the%20Falls%20Church%20tree)). Mosby and his rangers were meticulous in recording their “executions” of enemy spies or scouts elsewhere, but **nothing in their logs or correspondence points to a hanging in the village** ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=Mosby%20and%20his%20men%20consistently,in%20the%20Falls%20Church%20tree)). Local historian Bradley Gernand notes that even the Confederate guerrillas’ enemies (who documented Mosby’s activities closely) **reported no such incident at the tree**, which surely would have drawn notice had it occurred on a main road ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=Cavalry,have%20been%20observed%20and%20reported)). As Gernand bluntly put it, **“the records just don’t support it”** ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Except%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20true,%E2%80%9D)).

So where did the Hangman’s Tree legend come from? The story seems to trace back to **oral tradition** rather than official records. In 1961, Rev. Melvin Steadman published *Falls Church By Fence and Fireside*, a local history that included the hanging tale – but even he admitted his account was secondhand ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20Union%20Army%20also%20recorded,%E2%80%9D)). Steadman heard the story from his grandmother, who claimed *her* own grandmother had witnessed a hanging at the tree ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20Union%20Army%20also%20recorded,%E2%80%9D)). This kind of **folklore passed down through generations** is hard to verify. It likely mixed bits of truth (Mosby’s frightening raid and his stated intent to hang a local Unionist) with imaginative embellishment over time. In fact, many believe the legend sprang from Mosby’s thwarted plan to **capture and hang George Ives** – a widely known threat that, in retelling, morphed into an actual hanging story ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20legend%20itself%20possibly%20originated,legend%20of%20the%20Hangman%E2%80%99s%20Tree)). With no written eyewitness reports to pin down details, the tale took on a life of its own in community memory. 

Even the **“Battle of the Peach Orchard”** mentioned on the plaque feeds into this pattern of mythologizing. As noted above, there was no decisive battle at Falls Church’s orchards – just daily skirmishes in 1861 – but the colorful label stuck in folklore ([All Not So Quiet Along the Potomac: The 17th Virginia in Fairfax and Falls Church, August 1861](http://dclawyeronthecivilwar.blogspot.com/2011/08/17th-virginia-in-fairfax-and-falls.html#:~:text=Goree%20recounted%20to%20his%20mother,%28in%20Cutrer%2C%20p.%2035)) ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=elsewhere%20along%20W,one%20of%20the%20many%20farms)). In the same way, the dramatic image of Mosby stringing up Union spies on a prominent oak tree made for a sensational local legend, despite the lack of documentation. 

## From Oak to Memorial – and Modern Perspective  
The real **Hangman’s Tree** itself stood silent witness to these events but never served as an actual gallows. By the mid-20th century, that ancient oak was suffering from the city’s growth – road widening in the 1950s damaged its roots ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20unclear%20why%20the%20legend,was%20cut%20down%20in%201968)). The venerable tree finally died and was cut down in **1968** ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20tree%20of%20the%20legend,the%20legacy%20and%20story%20alive)). Not wanting to lose the lore, Falls Church’s Historical Commission placed a commemorative bronze plaque on a large boulder at the site (the southeast corner of W. Broad St. & N. Virginia Ave) a few years later ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=The%20tree%20of%20the%20legend,the%20legacy%20and%20story%20alive)). Engraved with the dramatic legend (prefaced carefully by “according to legend”), this marker was dedicated in 1968 and formally installed around **1985**, ensuring the Hangman’s Tree story lived on ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=anniversary%20of%20the%20Civil%20War,known%20Confederate)) ([F.C. Historical Panel Calls for ‘Hanging Tree’ Plaque Removal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/08/06/f-c-historical-panel-calls-for-hanging-tree-plaque-removal/#:~:text=Legend%20held%20that%20a%20tree,died%2C%20was%20the%20authentic%20site)). For decades the stone and plaque – tucked just behind a bus stop in front of today’s Liberty Barbecue restaurant – intrigued passersby with a nugget of local lore ([Legend of Civil War Era ‘Hangman’s Tree’ Lives On - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2018/06/29/legend-civil-war-era-hangmans-tree-lives/#:~:text=tree%2C%20keeping%20the%20legacy%20and,story%20alive)). 

However, in recent years the Hangman’s Tree plaque has been **re-examined and debated**. Local historians pointed out its inaccuracies and lack of context, concerned that a legend was being presented as fact ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=Commission%E2%80%99s%20role%20in%20the%20plaque%E2%80%99s,the%20wake%20of%20the%20100th)) ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20plausible%20evidence,Union%20prisoners%2C%20civilian%20kidnappings%2C%20and)). Others felt that, even as myth, a sign suggesting Confederates hanging Union men sends a troubling message. In 2020, amid a nationwide reconsideration of Confederate memorials, Falls Church’s Historical Commission voted **unanimously to remove the Hangman’s Tree plaque**, calling it a relic that conveyed a tacit pro-Confederate tone (even akin to a symbolically disturbing noose) ([F.C. Historical Panel Calls for ‘Hanging Tree’ Plaque Removal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/08/06/f-c-historical-panel-calls-for-hanging-tree-plaque-removal/#:~:text=By%20a%20unanimous%20vote%20last,Confederacy%20message)). The city agreed to take it down, and by 2021 the plaque was quietly **removed from the corner site** ([Hangman's Tree - The Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=37608#:~:text=Hangman%27s%20Tree%20,was%20at%20the%20intersection)). There is talk of replacing it with a new marker that might celebrate Falls Church’s urban forestry or simply note the historical presence of the old oak tree without the false hanging story ([F.C. Historical Panel Calls for ‘Hanging Tree’ Plaque Removal - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2020/08/06/f-c-historical-panel-calls-for-hanging-tree-plaque-removal/#:~:text=Keith%20Thurston%2C%20a%20member%20of,encouraging%20tree%20growth%20and%20nature)). 

Today, the saga of the Hangman’s Tree stands as a cautionary but fascinating piece of local lore. **No Union spies met their end on that oak’s limbs** – the only blood spilled in Falls Church was by the bullet, not the rope, and the true horror of Mosby’s raid needs no embellishment ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=1261&meta_id=94970#:~:text=occupying%20troops,subject%20of%20a%20Civil%20War)). Yet the legend, born of a community’s trauma and retold over generations, became part of Falls Church’s identity for over a century. By separating fact from fiction – through archival research, letters, and military records – historians have pieced together a clearer picture that honors **verifiable history over myth**. The Hangman’s Tree may be gone, but its story continues to evolve: from a fireside tale of vengeful Rebels, to a more nuanced narrative of a town caught between warring sides, where **history and memory intertwine** on the streets of Falls Church.
