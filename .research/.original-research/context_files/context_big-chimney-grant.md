Got it. I’ll analyze and cross-reference the map and coordinates you've provided with the Falls Church land grant data from the uploaded sources. I’ll determine which colonial land grant(s) correspond to the coordinates at [-77.174817, 38.882378] and who originally owned or leased the tract.

I’ll report back with the identified tract, boundaries, grant number (if available), original owner(s), and relevant context from the document.

Sit tight – this may take a moment.

# Northern Neck Grant #108 – Simon Pearson’s 1724 Falls Church Tract

## Grant Number and Original Grantee  
The coordinates **[-77.174817, 38.882378]** fall within **Northern Neck Grant #108**, a colonial land patent issued on August 1, 1724 to **Captain Simon Pearson (c.1688–1733)** ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)). This was the first recorded land grant within the present-day City of Falls Church ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)). Pearson’s 1724 patent encompassed a large tract (on the order of **~1,200 acres**, covering much of today’s Falls Church) – in fact, a 1763 survey noted that about 917 acres (nearly three-fourths of the original grant) remained intact as a single tract at that time ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=About%201763%20Broadwater%20was%20living,Beth)). Early survey records of Grant #108 even show a house on the property identified as Pearson’s residence ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)), indicating he established a dwelling there shortly after the grant was issued. However, Pearson did not remain long on this land; having built a house, he soon relocated to another plantation near Aquia Creek on the Potomac ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=He%20apparently%20spent%20enough%20time,the%20Potomac%20at%20Aquia%20Creek)), leaving the Falls Church tract to be managed by family and tenants.

## Boundaries and Notable Features  
One **notable boundary landmark** of Simon Pearson’s 1724 grant was an **“Indian poison field,”** mentioned as running along one side of the patent ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=land,Church%20was%20a%20hunting%20lodge)). This term referred to colonial observers’ name for areas deliberately burned out by Native Americans to aid in hunting – early settlers mistakenly thought the Indians had “poisoned” the soil, due to the absence of mature trees on such cleared land ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=assumed%20the%20lack%20of%20foliage,Church%20was%20a%20hunting%20lodge)). The inclusion of an “Indian poison field” as a border in Pearson’s deed underscores the tract’s frontier nature in the early 18th century. The Pearson grant lay between the local watersheds of Four Mile Run to the north and Tripps Run to the south, roughly parallel to modern Route 7 (the Leesburg Pike) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=name%20for%20the%20trail%20from,crossed%20over%20the%20present%20highway)). It was situated near the junction of important trails/roads of the time – notably the road from Alexandria to the “Falls” (the upper Potomac) and the path toward Thomas Lee’s warehouses on Pimmit Run, an intersection that later became the site of The Falls Church (established 1733) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=instrumental%20in%20the%20establishment%20of,of%201733%20states%20Reverend%20Lawrence)). These geographic features oriented Pearson’s tract and later helped define local property lines. A mid-18th-century survey of the Pearson patent (referenced in the Falls Church Historical Commission map) shows its expanse overlaying much of today’s city landscape, with the **Little Falls** branch running through it (for which Little Falls Street is named). In summary, Pearson’s grant was a vast, irregular parcel marked by natural features – streams, woods, and at least one cleared “Indian field” – that later became the heart of Falls Church.

## Original Ownership and Early Use  
**Capt. Simon Pearson**, the original grantee of this tract, was a prominent early Fairfax County planter and militia captain. Although he acquired the Falls Church land in 1724, Pearson’s primary residence remained in Stafford County (where his will was proved) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)). Still, he evidently occupied the Falls Church property briefly: a facsimile of the grant’s survey shows a house on the tract labeled as Pearson’s home ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)). This suggests Pearson established a small plantation or hunting lodge there in the 1720s, likely taking advantage of the cleared “poison field” and a nearby spring for water ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=the%20spring%20near%20the%20present,trails%20as%20they%20hunted%20game)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=for%20a%20drink%20of%20water%2C,White%20men)). Within a few years, however, Pearson moved his base to a Potomac River plantation at Aquia Creek ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=He%20apparently%20spent%20enough%20time,the%20Potomac%20at%20Aquia%20Creek)). He left the Falls Church grant in the hands of family and overseers, treating it as one of several land investments he held in Northern Virginia. (Captain Pearson was a prolific landowner – he or his family held multiple grants in the region, including 660 acres along the road to Alexandria, a 1,409-acre share in the vast Ravensworth tract, and other parcels near Falls Church ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Pearson%20held%20grants%20for%20a,miles%20of%20the%20Falls%20Church)) – underscoring that the Falls Church tract was part of a much larger portfolio.) Before his death, Pearson likely made only limited improvements on the Falls Church property beyond the initial dwelling. There is no record that he formally leased it in the 1720s, but it’s possible local “squatters” or caretakers farmed portions of it, as was common practice if an owner was absent ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Prior%20to%201724%20there%20were,live%20on%20their%20grants%2C%20but)). In **1733**, Captain Pearson died, and **his children inherited the Falls Church land** ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Captain%20Simon%E2%80%99s%20second%20wife%20was,vicinity%20of%20the%20Falls%20Church)). This marked the beginning of a long series of family successions and land divisions that would shape the tract’s later history.

## Inheritance and Subsequent Transfers  
Over the 18th century, Pearson’s original grant (#108) underwent several **transfers, leases, and inheritances** as it passed through the Pearson family and to other prominent locals. Key developments included:

- **1733 – Family Inheritance:** Upon Simon Pearson’s death around 1733, his **heirs** assumed control of the Falls Church tract. Pearson’s only son, **Thomas Pearson (c.1712–1744)**, and his daughters **Margaret and Susannah** all **inherited portions of the land in the vicinity of The Falls Church** ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Captain%20Simon%E2%80%99s%20second%20wife%20was,vicinity%20of%20the%20Falls%20Church)). In practice, Thomas Pearson, as the eldest son, likely received the principal plantation at Falls Church (while the daughters may have received portions or other property nearby). 

- **1744 – Estate of Thomas Pearson:** **Thomas Pearson died in 1744** at about 32 years old ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Thomas%20Pearson%20%28c.%201712,two%20and%20his%20widow%2C%20Anne)), leaving the Falls Church lands to **his infant son, Simon Pearson (born c.1737)**. Thomas’s widow, **Anne Amelia Pearson (née Markham)**, remarried to **Colonel Charles Broadwater Jr.** not long after ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Amelia%20Markham%20%281709,Charles%20Broadwater)). Because young **Simon Pearson (the grandson of the original grantee)** was underage, the court appointed guardians to manage his inheritance – first family friend **William Henry Terrett**, and by 1758 **Col. Charles Broadwater (his stepfather)** became Simon’s guardian ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Jr.,in%20behalf%20of%20young%20Simon)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=both%20persons%20were%20underage%20as,parties%20legal%20standing%20as%20adults)). During this period, the Falls Church tract remained largely intact, and it came to be overseen by Broadwater through the Pearson family connection.

- **Mid-18th Century – Leasing to Tenants:** As was common with large tracts, portions of the Pearson land were **leased to tenants** for farming. By the 1750s, **John Hurst** – a rising local figure – had leased sections of the Pearson tract. In fact, **Hurst leased more than one portion from Simon Pearson’s estate**, apparently *displacing earlier tenants* (the lease documents name previous occupants like **John Williams, Gerrard Bowling, and William Trammell** who had been in possession) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=After%20the%20death%20of%20Martha,Williams%2C%20Gerrard%20Bowling%20and%20William)). To support Hurst’s operation of the farm, **Simon Pearson (the younger) even provided Hurst with nine slaves** “to work for Hurst during Pearson’s lifetime,” suggesting an arrangement to ensure the land was productively managed while Simon retained ultimate ownership ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Trammell%20as%20being%20in%20previous,%C2%AEs)). One of the prior tenants, **William (or Gerrard) Trammell**, had been associated with the tract (Trammell’s land lay just north of Pearson’s, by Four Mile Run ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Broadwater%20did%20not%20hold%20an,directed%20by%20another%20court%20to)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=city%20of%20Falls%20Church%2C%20but,directed%20by%20another%20court%20to))), but Hurst’s lease indicates the Pearson family chose to install a new, presumably more reliable, leaseholder. Hurst’s tenancy on the Pearson grant lands in the 1750s-60s is well documented and even led to colorful incidents (he was once fined in 1759 for failing to post a direction sign, and charged with misconduct for breeding horses “at the Falls Church” during service) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=In%201759%20Hurst%20was%20fined,%C2%AE)) – illustrating that he was active on the property and in the community.

- **1763 – Broadwater’s Quarter:** Under Broadwater’s stewardship, a large part of the original grant was set aside as **“Broadwater’s Quarter.”** In **1763** Col. **Charles Broadwater** leased a **917-acre portion** of Pearson’s Falls Church patent ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=About%201763%20Broadwater%20was%20living,Beth)). This **represented nearly three-quarters of the entire original grant**, and essentially constituted the western and central bulk of the tract. Broadwater’s lease of this vast acreage was significant enough to trigger a **boundary dispute** – within a year, a neighbor **(Benjamin Sebastian)** filed a lawsuit challenging the lease’s extent or boundaries ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=About%201763%20Broadwater%20was%20living,Beth)). The court upheld Broadwater’s claim ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Quarter%2C%20a%20tract%20of%20917,The%20Reverend%20Benjamin%20Sebastian%2C%20Jr)), and interestingly, any hard feelings were smoothed over by family ties: two of Broadwater’s children eventually married two of Sebastian’s children, suggesting the families reconciled ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Quarter%2C%20a%20tract%20of%20917,The%20Reverend%20Benjamin%20Sebastian%2C%20Jr)). Broadwater’s Quarter remained a major plantation site; Broadwater himself (a leading militia officer and sheriff in Fairfax) likely placed overseers on this land. By about 1763, **Broadwater was residing near Falls Church**, and though he did not technically own Pearson’s patent, he exercised significant control over it through his lease and his role as stepfather/guardian to the young Pearson heir ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Broadwater%E2%80%99s%20marriage%20to%20Thomas%20Pearson%E2%80%99s,and%201759%2C%20he%20was%20appointed)). 

- **1758–1765 – Simon Pearson’s Personal Dealings:** As he reached adulthood in the late 1750s, **Simon Pearson (the younger)** began asserting control and making personal dispositions of the land. In **1758**, during Simon’s ill-fated first marriage (to Milcah “Milkey” Trammell), Broadwater’s records note building a frame house for Simon on the Falls Church property ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20supposition%20of%20the%20length,tobacco%20to%20Milkey%20Pearson%20annually)) – possibly indicating a new dwelling or improvements for the young couple. The marriage ended in a scandalous **divorce by 1759**, and soon after, Simon became entangled with **Peletiah Grafford**, the daughter of a local tavern keeper. **In 1759, Simon Pearson granted Peletiah Grafford and their infant son a portion of the Falls Church tract** as a gift ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=A%20suit%20of%201759%20alleged,%C2%AE)). In the deed for this land transfer, Simon **acknowledged Peletiah’s son John as his own**, an extraordinary admission for the time ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=father%2C%20Thomas%2C%20kept%20an%20ordinary,%C2%AE)). Peletiah Grafford promptly sold the parcel, cashing out her child’s inheritance, and Simon’s divorce settlement allowed Milcah Trammell (his former wife) to retain their child, suggesting Simon’s personal life was tumultuous ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=A%20suit%20of%201759%20alleged,%C2%AE)). This episode illustrates how pieces of the Pearson grant began to break off: through **marriage settlements and gifts**, Simon fragmented the estate even while he still owned it.

- **1760s–1790s – Sales to Prominent Neighbors:** As the decades went on, **Simon Pearson gradually sold off or lost much of his inheritance**. By the 1770s and 1780s, large portions of Grant #108 had transitioned to new owners. **By the time of Simon Pearson’s death in 1797**, “many tracts of land had been sold… and were owned by others, including **George Washington**, **Charles Broadwater**, and **John Hurst**” ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=War,the%20lands%20he%20had%20inherited)). This indicates that **George Washington** himself acquired a piece of the original Falls Church patent – Washington had land interests throughout Fairfax County, and one such purchase included part of the Pearson tract (Washington’s papers elsewhere note his investments in land near Four Mile Run and Falls Church in the 1760s). **John Hurst**, who had been a lessee, evidently managed to **purchase some of Pearson’s land outright** as well (in addition to the neighboring Harrison tract he bought, as noted below). And Col. **Broadwater**, whose lease of 917 acres gave him effective control, may have formally gained title to that quarter-section or other pieces (or his heirs did so later). In **c.1789**, Simon Pearson – having no legitimate surviving children – **willed his remaining property to his brother, Thomas Pearson Jr.**, who had moved to Kentucky ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Simon%20reportedly%20had%20children%20by,Kentucky%20sometime%20after%20the%20Revolutionary)). But by that point, relatively little remained intact. The once-expansive Pearson grant had been divided among prominent colonial figures, sold to cover debts, or leased out long-term. In short, **the coordinate in question lies in what was originally Pearson’s vast 1724 patent**, which by 1800 had evolved into a patchwork of farms and estates (Broadwater’s Quarter, parts owned by the Washington family, the Hurst/Wren **“Winter Hill”** estate, etc.), no longer under a single owner’s control.

## Notable Adjacent Grants and Context  
For completeness, it’s worth noting the **neighboring colonial grants** around Pearson’s tract, which help confirm the identification of Grant #108 at these coordinates. To the east, **Thomas Harrison Jr.’s 1731 grant (NN #270)** of 270 acres adjoined Pearson’s land near today’s Seven Corners ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Thomas%20Harrison%2C%20Junior%20%28%3F,%C2%AE%20The%20Prince%20William)). Harrison’s grant included a small portion inside the modern Falls Church city limits (later known as the **Winter Hill** property) with the bulk extending toward Seven Corners ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Thomas%20Harrison%2C%20Junior%20%28%3F,that%20time%20Fairfax%20and%20Loudoun)). John Hurst purchased that Harrison parcel in 1761 and sold it to James Wren in 1787, whereafter it was called **“Winter Hill”** ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Thrift%20until%201761%20when%20John,and%20was%20named%20Winter%20Hill)). To the northwest, **John Harle’s 1728 grant (NN #166)** touched the city around the George Mason High School area ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=A%20small%20portion%20of%20this,to%20his%20wife%20and%20son)), but Harle never lived on that tract and it did not figure prominently in Falls Church’s development. And just north of Pearson’s land, beyond Four Mile Run, lay **John Trammell’s 1727 grant (NN #98)**, an 185-acre patent along the stream ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Broadwater%20did%20not%20hold%20an,directed%20by%20another%20court%20to)). These adjacent grants are documented on historical maps; Pearson’s **Grant #108** clearly occupies the central Falls Church area by process of elimination and by explicit documentary reference. For example, Michael Reagan’s 179-acre grant (#187) partly overlapped what had been **George Harrison’s** Falls Church property ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=daughters,leaving%20various%20amounts%20to%20them)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=was%20settled%20on%20this%20property,Carlyle%20for%20three%20hundred%20pounds)) – Reagan’s land was actually the western half of Harrison’s grant, not Pearson’s ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20plantation%20which%20he%20left,Virginia%2C%20sold%20the%20Falls%20Church)). The fact that **Pearson’s patent was the only early grant fully within the current city boundaries** prior to 1730 confirms that the coordinates given correspond to **Pearson’s 1724 grant** ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)). 

## Historical Significance  
In summary, **NN Grant #108 (1724)** – Simon Pearson’s Falls Church land – is the colonial grant at **38.882378 N, 77.174817 W**. This tract not only encompasses the spot in question, but it also represents the genesis of European landownership in Falls Church City. **Original Grantee:** Captain Simon Pearson, a relation of George Washington’s family (his second wife was Hannah Ball, half-sister to Washington’s mother ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Captain%20Simon%E2%80%99s%20second%20wife%20was,vicinity%20of%20the%20Falls%20Church))). **Notable Boundaries:** included an “Indian poison field” clearing ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=land,Church%20was%20a%20hunting%20lodge)). **Primary Features:** Site of one of the first houses in Falls Church (Pearson’s dwelling) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)) and later the location of The Falls Church itself (built 1733 just east of Pearson’s house site). **Tenure and Transfers:** Pearson’s heirs (the **Pearson family**) held the land through mid-century, after which it was **leased to influential figures** like Col. Charles Broadwater ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=About%201763%20Broadwater%20was%20living,Beth)) and entrepreneur John Hurst ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=After%20the%20death%20of%20Martha,Williams%2C%20Gerrard%20Bowling%20and%20William)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=Trammell%20as%20being%20in%20previous,%C2%AEs)). Portions were **sold or gifted** over time – including a lot given to Peletiah Grafford in 1759 ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=father%2C%20Thomas%2C%20kept%20an%20ordinary,%C2%AE)) – and by 1790s the estate had passed into the hands of multiple prominent owners (the **Washington**, **Broadwater**, **Hurst/Wren**, and **Reagan/Neale** interests) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=War,the%20lands%20he%20had%20inherited)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=was%20settled%20on%20this%20property,Carlyle%20for%20three%20hundred%20pounds)). Throughout this process, the original grant’s boundaries can be traced in later property lines and are corroborated by the Falls Church Historical Commission’s overlay map of colonial grants on the modern city (the uploaded map confirms that the coordinate lies well within Pearson’s grant). 

**Conclusion:** The colonial land grant at the given Falls Church coordinates is **Northern Neck Grant #108, Captain Simon Pearson’s 1724 patent**, distinguished by its early date, large size, and eventual subdivision among many notable colonial families. This identification is firmly supported by the historical record in *“Colonial Landgrants and Their Owners or Tenants”* ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=The%20first%20recorded%20grant%20within,%E2%80%9D%20%28See%20facsimile)) ([IIIFScribe_HCFC_Colonial_Landgrants_and_Their_Owners_or_Tenants_2025-04-19T14-01-36.txt](file://file-WEFi3RPomUmVpV1xHA9LKg#:~:text=War,the%20lands%20he%20had%20inherited)) and by mapping of the original grant boundaries on the present-day landscape. The Pearson grant set the stage for early settlement at The Falls Church and its legacy endured through the various farms (Broadwater’s Quarter, Winter Hill, etc.) that later occupied the same ground.
