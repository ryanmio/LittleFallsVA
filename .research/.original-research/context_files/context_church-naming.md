# The Naming of **The Falls Church**: Claim vs. Historical Record

## Claim in *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited*  
In the local history book *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited*, the authors assert that both the original 1734 wooden church and its 1769 brick successor were **named "The Falls Church"** at the time of their construction. The book specifically states: 

> *"The wooden structure of the first church 'near the falls' was completed in 1734 and was replaced by a sturdy brick building in 1769, both named 'The Falls Church' after an important geographical feature nearby, the Little Falls of the Potomac River."* {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/pdfs/Falls_Church_Virginia_Village_Revisited.pdf#:~:text=The%20wooden%20structure%20of%20the,in%20%201734%20and%20was" title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}

This claim implies that as early as 1734 the church was formally known by the name "The Falls Church." To critically examine this, we must compare the claim with contemporary 18th-century records from Truro Parish (the Anglican parish that built and governed the church).

## Contemporary Records and the Name's Timeline  
Early vestry minutes, contracts, and deeds from Truro Parish provide evidence of **what the church was called in the 1700s**. These primary sources suggest that the name *"The Falls Church"* was **not** used at the very beginning, but emerged a few decades later. Key historical references include:

1. **1733–1734 – Construction of the First Church:** On June 9, 1733, the Truro Parish vestry contracted Colonel Richard Blackburn to build a chapel **"at the Cross roads near Michael Reagan's"** {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=Gabriel%20Adams%2C%20Edward%20Barry%2C%20John,to%20take%20care%20that%20the" title="Truro Parish Vestry Minutes, 1733" >}}. The contract described the location and dimensions of the building (40 by 22 feet, etc.), but **gave no official name** – it was simply the *new church at the crossroads*. In fact, when this **wooden chapel** was completed in 1734, it was generally referred to by description, not by a formal title.

2. **1746 – Referred to as the "Upper Church":** As the parish grew, it had multiple chapels, and the Falls Church location was **distinguished by geography rather than a unique name**. A 1746 land deed demonstrates this: John Trammell conveyed two acres to the vestry **"where the Upper Church now is"** {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=Trammell,Trammell%20received%20fifty%20shillings%20sterling" title="John Trammell Land Deed, 1746" >}}. In other words, the Falls Church was informally called the *"Upper Church"* (meaning the upriver or uproute church) to distinguish it from the parish's other chapel (the *Lower Church*, also known as Occoquan or Pohick Church). This deed language shows that **over a decade after its construction, the 1734 building still had no official name** beyond such descriptors.

3. **1757 – First Recorded Use of "Falls Church":** The name **"Falls Church"** first appears in the Truro Parish vestry book in late 1757 – **over twenty years after the chapel was built**. On November 28, 1757, the vestry minutes record paying John Lumley, the parish clerk, for serving at "Falls Church" {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=for%20the%20land.,note%20that%20at%20one%20time" title="Truro Parish Vestry Minutes, November 1757" >}}. This is the earliest known contemporary reference to the church by the name *"Falls Church"*. Prior to this entry, all vestry records referred to the building simply as the *Upper Church* or by other descriptions {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=for%20the%20land.,note%20that%20at%20one%20time" title="Truro Parish Vestry Records Analysis" >}}. The adoption of the name likely reflects the church's proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac, a notable local landmark – it was essentially **shorthand for "the church near the falls."**

4. **1763 – Common Usage in Official Records:** After 1757, the vestry **consistently used "The Falls Church"** to refer to the site. For example, parish minutes for March 28, 1763 begin, *"At a Vestry for Truro Parish held at **the Falls Church** March 28, 1763…"*, going on to discuss the condition of the building {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=already%20in%20disrepair%2C%20and%20the,be%20built%20at%20the%20same" title="Truro Parish Vestry Minutes, March 1763" >}}. This shows that by the early 1760s the name was firmly established in official usage. (Notably, this 1763 meeting — held **at** The Falls Church — was attended by vestryman **George Washington**, who had just joined the Truro Vestry {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=already%20in%20disrepair%2C%20and%20the,be%20built%20at%20the%20same" title="George Washington's Attendance at Truro Vestry" >}}.)

5. **1769 – Construction of the Brick Church:** The old wooden structure was deemed "rotten and unfit for repair" in 1763, and the vestry resolved to erect a new church on the same site {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=Truro%20Parish%20held%20at%20the,the%20first%20vestry%20attended%20by" title="Truro Parish Decision to Rebuild, 1763" >}}. When the **brick church** was completed in 1769, it naturally inherited the already established name **"The Falls Church."** All contemporary documents from the 1760s onward – including contracts with architect James Wren and later parish mentions – use the name Falls Church for the building and location. In short, by the time the second church was built, *The Falls Church* was the accepted name of both the building and the surrounding community.

## Analysis of Discrepancies and Historical Context  
The **evidence above reveals a discrepancy** between the book's claim and the historical record. The **first church (1734)** was *not actually called "The Falls Church" when it was built* – that name **evolved later**. In its early decades, people spoke of it as the new or upper church near the falls, but **the specific title "Falls Church" was a mid-18th century development** {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=for%20the%20land.,note%20that%20at%20one%20time" title="Truro Parish Vestry Records Analysis" >}}. The book's wording thus appears to apply the modern name retroactively to the 1734 building. This is a form of **retrospective naming**: a historical narrative convenience that can blur the timeline of when a name came into use.

It's important to note that the book's broader point – that the name derives from a nearby geographical feature (the Little Falls of the Potomac) – **is accurate in essence**. The Falls of the Potomac were a significant landmark, and as the church became locally prominent, the falls inspired its name. In fact, even **19th-century historians** recognized this connection; for instance, Bishop William Meade, writing about Virginia's colonial churches, referred to the chapel as the "Little Falls Church," explicitly linking it to the Little Falls {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=for%20the%20land.,June%209%2C%201733%20is%20the" title="Bishop Meade's Historical Account" >}}. This underlines that the falls were indeed the source of the name. 

However, the **timing** of the naming is historically significant. The delay until 1757 in seeing "Falls Church" in official records suggests that the church's identity evolved along with the community. In the 1730s–1740s, the congregation was just one of several in Truro Parish, so it was identified by location (upper vs. lower church). By the 1750s, the surrounding hamlet had grown and the church had stood for a generation, which likely led locals to start calling it "the Falls Church" in everyday speech – a name that the vestry then adopted in writing {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/little_falls_research.json#:~:text=for%20the%20land.,note%20that%20at%20one%20time" title="Truro Parish Vestry Records Analysis" >}}. Once established, that name persisted and was firmly attached to the new brick building in 1769.

**Implications:** This finding highlights how historical claims should be checked against primary sources. While it is convenient to say the church "was named The Falls Church in 1734," the records show a more nuanced reality. The *first* building was not originally so named, even though today we refer to it as the first Falls Church. The **anachronism in the book's claim** is understandable as shorthand, but it glosses over the period when the church's name was in flux. For historians and readers, this serves as a reminder that **place names often become official over time**. It also illustrates the rich detail found in vestry minutes and land records: those documents not only tell us about construction and maintenance of the church, but also preserve the **evolution of its identity** – from "the crossroads church" to the Upper Church, and finally to **The Falls Church**.

In conclusion, the **primary sources contradict the notion that the first chapel was called "The Falls Church" at its inception**. The name **did** ultimately come to honor the nearby Little Falls, but only from 1757 onward. By the time the brick church rose in 1769, *The Falls Church* was well established as the church's name – unifying the history of both structures under the title that endures to this day.
