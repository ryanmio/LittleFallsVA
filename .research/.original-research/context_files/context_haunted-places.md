# Haunted Places, Ghost Stories & Urban Legends of Falls Church, VA

Falls Church, Virginia – nicknamed “The Little City” – may be small in size, but it boasts a surprisingly rich tapestry of ghostly lore and spooky history. Both Falls Church City and its surrounding areas (often sharing the Falls Church mailing address) have long whispered tales of haunted farmhouses, phantom Civil War soldiers, eerie cemeteries, and inexplicable encounters. Below we delve into the most popular haunted sites, local ghost stories passed down through generations, and the real historical events behind these legends. We’ll separate **fact vs. fiction** along the way – giving you the true history as well as the folklore – and highlight ghost tours, investigations, and oral traditions that keep these supernatural stories alive.

## Cherry Hill Farmhouse – Historic Home with Civil War Specters?

One of Falls Church’s most famous historic homes, **Cherry Hill Farmhouse** (circa 1845), often tops the list of local “haunts.” This Greek Revival house survived the Civil War despite being repeatedly overrun and raided by soldiers ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=Cherry%20Hill%20was%20involved%20in,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)). **Legends & Claims:** With Union encampments on the property and rumors of a skirmish fought in its old peach orchard, it’s no wonder locals have speculated about lingering Civil War spirits ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=Washington%E2%80%99s%20defenses%20was%20less%20than,here%20rather%20than%20actual%20battles)). Some say phantom soldiers still patrol the grounds at night or that strange noises echo from the 19th-century barn. Over the years, Cherry Hill has embraced its spooky reputation by hosting Victorian-style **ghost story nights** and serving as the starting point for the Falls Church Ghost Tour each Halloween season ([Calendar: October 20th – October 26th - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/20/calendar-october-20th-october-26th/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20Ghost%20Tour,m)). 

**Historical Facts:** Cherry Hill’s wartime history is well documented – artifacts like Minie balls, a Union belt buckle, and a shell fragment were unearthed on-site ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=attractive%20to%20soldiers%20who%20lived,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)). These confirm that soldiers camped here, though evidence of an actual pitched battle is scant (most bullets found were unfired). The tales of a firefight in the orchard are likely exaggerated folklore, but they add color to the farmhouse’s past ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=attractive%20to%20soldiers%20who%20lived,here%20rather%20than%20actual%20battles)). While **no officially recorded ghost sighting** exists for Cherry Hill, its role as a “spectator and participant” in the Civil War has inspired plenty of ghostly lore ([About & History | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://fallschurchva.gov/1585/About-History#:~:text=Cherry%20Hill%20was%20involved%20in,However%2C%20most%20of%20the)). Visitors touring the creaking old house on a dark evening – especially during the annual Halloween storytelling events – might easily imagine the flicker of an oil lamp revealing a Union sentry in the parlor or hear the faint whisper of a long-ago farm resident. These impressions, however, remain **anecdotal**. In short, Cherry Hill Farmhouse’s “haunting” is more about historical ambiance and community storytelling than any verified paranormal activity. 

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** Cherry Hill was truly occupied by Civil War troops and looted of its harvest – that’s fact. The idea that ghosts of Union or Confederate soldiers still roam the orchard is folklore. It makes for great storytelling on the ghost tour, but it isn’t backed by historical records.)*

## The Legend of the Hangman’s Tree – Myth, Murder & Mosby’s “Ghost”

On West Broad Street in Falls Church City, a small rock and plaque mark the spot where a massive oak known as the **“Hangman’s Tree”** once stood. According to local legend, Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby (the famed “Gray Ghost”) **hanged Union spies** from this oak during the Civil War ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Local%20lore%20has%20it%20that,spies%20from%20the%20fabled%20tree)). This morbid tale has been repeated for generations – the very stuff of ghost tours and campfire stories. People have claimed that on certain nights, the ghosts of hanged men could be seen swinging from the invisible gallows or that the tree’s stump gave off an unearthly aura. 

**Historical Facts:** The Hangman’s Tree makes for a chilling story, but historical research shows it’s **mostly fiction**. In reality, there are **no records or contemporary accounts of any hangings** at that tree ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=fabled%20tree)). In fact, historians (including Falls Church author Bradley Gernand) note that even the folks who installed the plaque in 1968 did so tongue-in-cheek – they knew the tale wasn’t true ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Except%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20true,%E2%80%9D)). The truth behind the legend is still dark, however. In October 1864, Mosby did raid Falls Church and intended to kill the Unionist postmaster, George Ives (who luckily was out of town) ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%20is%20true%2C%20Gernand%20says%2C,%E2%80%9D)). Instead, Mosby’s rangers murdered **John Read**, a local man known for teaching enslaved people to read – a deed possibly mistaken for Union spying ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20also%20true%20that%20Mosby,West%20Broad%20Street%2C%E2%80%9D%20Gernand%20says)). Mosby’s men dumped Read’s body miles away, and his remains were later buried in the Falls Church Episcopal cemetery ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=people%20how%20to%20read%20and,West%20Broad%20Street%2C%E2%80%9D%20Gernand%20says)). 

Despite the lack of any actual hangings, the **Hangman’s Tree legend persisted**. It likely grew out of a community’s effort to make sense of a violent event – or simply out of a taste for the macabre. By the early 20th century, locals fully believed spies swung from that oak, and ghost stories followed. Today’s ghost tour guides make sure to **separate the myth from the history**: they’ll recount the spooky lore of the hangings (for the shivers) but also explain that **no one was ever executed at the tree** ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Except%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20true,%E2%80%9D)). That hasn’t stopped imaginative souls from seeing spectral shapes near its former location or feeling an “odd chill” by the plaque late at night – but those experiences are better attributed to suggestion than to spirits. 

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** Mosby’s 1864 raid and John Read’s murder are documented historical events – grim but real. The Hangman’s Tree executions are pure legend. Any ghost associated with that tree (say, an apparition of a hanged spy) is unsupported by fact. Interestingly, the real victim, John Read, **is** buried in Falls Church, but there are no famous ghost stories about him – only a proud gravestone in the old churchyard marking a tragic tale.)*

## Haunted Cemeteries – The Falls Church & Oakwood’s Restless Residents

No haunted places list would be complete without a **graveyard**, and Falls Church has a couple of notable ones. The church that gave the city its name – **The Falls Church (Episcopal)**, founded in 1734 – sits amid a historic cemetery. Tombstones here date back to the 1700s, and many **Civil War dead** were interred during the conflict. During the war, the Falls Church building itself was seized by Union troops and turned into a hospital and stable, reportedly leaving pews scarred by horses and soldiers ([History of Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Falls_Church#:~:text=History%20of%20Falls%20Church%20,But%20some)) ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=It%20is%20true%2C%20Gernand%20says%2C,%E2%80%9D)). With such history, it’s easy to imagine ghostly soldiers wandering the grounds or mourning family members still keeping vigil. Indeed, some visitors have described an uncanny stillness or felt they were “not alone” among the weathered headstones (though these stories are usually general and not tied to specific named ghosts).

The Falls Church cemetery’s most dramatic real story is the burial of **John Read** (the Mosby raid victim mentioned above). His grave lies next to his wife’s in this churchyard ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=people%20how%20to%20read%20and,West%20Broad%20Street%2C%E2%80%9D%20Gernand%20says)). While there’s no widely told ghost tale about Read, one can’t help but feel a somber presence near his resting place knowing his violent end. On misty evenings, the mind might conjure up an image of a bereft Mrs. Read searching for her husband’s spirit among the graves – a poignant *imagining*, but not a recorded haunting.

Over on Roosevelt Boulevard, **Oakwood Cemetery** is another repository of local history and lore. Founded in the mid-1800s, Oakwood became the primary burial ground for Falls Church and nearby Arlington families ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/06/24/our-man-in-arlington-429/#:~:text=I%20received%20a%20tour%20of,both%20Arlingtonians%20and%20Falls%20Churchians)) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/06/24/our-man-in-arlington-429/#:~:text=I%20go%20there%20mostly%20to,carry%20some%20of%20those%20names)). Oakwood’s occupants include Civil War soldiers (Confederate and Union alike) and prominent citizens whose names echo in local street names (Munson, Birch, Shreve, etc.) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/06/24/our-man-in-arlington-429/#:~:text=I%20go%20there%20mostly%20to,carry%20some%20of%20those%20names)). With so many old graves, Oakwood has naturally invited ghostly speculation. In particular, Oakwood is linked to **one of Northern Virginia’s most famous ghost stories**: the spirit of **Margaret “Peggy” Febrey**, a 14-year-old girl who died of tuberculosis in 1913 ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=The%20contractors%20were%20e,TV.%20The%20National%20Paranormal)). Peggy Febrey’s *body* lies in Oakwood, but her *ghost* is said to have appeared a mile away at the old Febrey family house (later the Overlee Community Club in Arlington). 

According to multiple witnesses and news reports, a **young girl in a white Victorian dress** was seen peering from the Overlee clubhouse windows and sitting on the basement stairs – only to vanish when approached ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=In%20January%2C%20a%20construction%20worker,off%20construction%20zone)) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=The%20contractors%20were%20e,National%20Paranormal%20Association%20got%20wind)). This happened during renovations in 2012, and construction workers recognized the girl from an old photo of Peggy Febrey ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=company%20had%20been%20alerted%20by,had%20spoken%20of%20for%20decades)). Neighbors had long claimed Overlee’s grounds were haunted by a friendly girl spirit, even hearing unexplained music at night ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=Association%20got%20wind)). Paranormal enthusiasts swooped in on the story, dubbing her the “Overlee ghost.” Since Peggy’s grave is at Oakwood, that cemetery gets looped into the legend as well. People have left flowers and wondered if her spirit roams between the two places. 

Beyond Peggy, Oakwood’s atmosphere itself can send a shiver down the spine. Tall oak trees and aging monuments create the classic “haunted graveyard” vibe. Some sections – such as an old **children’s burial section** – especially tug at the emotions, leading a few visitors to report faint phantom giggles or tiny shadows in the corner of their eye. These anecdotes are unverified, but they persist in the community’s oral lore. 

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** The Falls Church and Oakwood cemeteries are very real, and full of fascinating history. Ghost encounters in them, however, are **mostly anecdotal**. The Overlee/Peggy Febrey sightings were reported in newspapers and TV – giving that ghost story some documentable weight ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=In%20January%2C%20a%20construction%20worker,off%20construction%20zone)) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=The%20contractors%20were%20e,National%20Paranormal%20Association%20got%20wind)). But note, Peggy’s ghost was seen **at Overlee’s house**, not at her Oakwood grave. The cemeteries themselves have no famous, well-documented ghost sightings – only the typical creepy experiences one might feel in any old graveyard at night. In other words, plenty of ambiance, but scant evidence of actual specters.)*

## Eerie Echoes in Parks & Woods: The Ghost of Roundtree Park

Even the wooded parks of greater Falls Church have their ghostly legends. The best-known is **Roundtree Park**, a leafy streamside park straddling Falls Church and Annandale (Falls Church mailing address 22042). For years, visitors have whispered about a **ghostly woman carrying a baby** who haunts the park’s trails ([Forget the Bunnyman Bridge. Visit Roundtree Park in Falls Church for a local paranormal experience. : r/nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/17jfm20/forget_the_bunnyman_bridge_visit_roundtree_park/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRoundtree%20Park%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C,%E2%80%9D)). The story goes that near dusk, people sometimes see the silhouette of a forlorn mother cradling an infant, wandering among the trees. Those who encounter her report an overwhelming feeling of being watched by an “unseen entity” and an inexplicable sadness in the air ([Forget the Bunnyman Bridge. Visit Roundtree Park in Falls Church for a local paranormal experience. : r/nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/17jfm20/forget_the_bunnyman_bridge_visit_roundtree_park/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRoundtree%20Park%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C,%E2%80%9D)). Who is she? No one knows for sure – some say she may have been a tragic figure from early Falls Church history, perhaps a woman who lost her child and herself in the nearby stream. Others speculate it’s just an “urban legend” borrowed from elsewhere (the image of a lady in white with a baby is a recurring theme in folklore worldwide).

Interestingly, **multiple park-goers have independently mentioned this apparition**, enough that Roundtree Park gets listed in haunted places databases ([Haunted Locations: Falls Church, Virginia - GHOSTQUEST.NET](https://www.ghostquest.net/haunted-places-falls-church-virginia.html#:~:text=Coordinates%3A%20Location%20Address%3A%C2%A0Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia,identity%20and%20the%20reason%20for)). In an online forum, one local even recounted a spine-chilling personal encounter: while walking the dog at twilight, they glimpsed a pale female figure ahead on the path. Their dog began whimpering and refused to go forward. The figure then vanished into thin air. While this account is purely anecdotal (shared on Reddit and not corroborated), it matches the broader Roundtree lore of a female ghost in the woods.

Apart from ghostly sightings, Roundtree Park’s dense woods just *feel* ripe for a haunting. The rustle of leaves and lack of streetlights can easily play tricks on the imagination. Perhaps these natural spooks gave birth to the tale in the first place. The park’s proximity to **Sleepy Hollow Road** (yes, that’s the actual name of a nearby street!) likely adds to the supernatural mystique. Sleepy Hollow Road itself has garnered questions like “is it haunted?” simply due to its name, though no specific legend has taken root there beyond Halloween-y vibes.

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** The **“woman with a baby” at Roundtree Park is firmly in the realm of local legend**. There are no known historical incidents on that site involving a mother and child to explain the ghost. No newspaper has documented an encounter. But the consistency of reports among locals is intriguing, suggesting a shared folklore that has taken hold. It’s a good example of a modern Falls Church urban legend – one that continues to evolve through word of mouth and the internet age. If you’re strolling Roundtree Park at dusk, keep an open mind… and maybe an eye on the shadows, just for fun ([Forget the Bunnyman Bridge. Visit Roundtree Park in Falls Church for a local paranormal experience. : r/nova](https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/17jfm20/forget_the_bunnyman_bridge_visit_roundtree_park/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRoundtree%20Park%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C,%E2%80%9D)).)*

## Haunted Houses & Hometown Horrors: From “Spook House” to Secret Tunnels

Falls Church’s neighborhoods hide some eerie tales behind picket fences. A few old homes have gained reputations for being **haunted**, whether by actual reported apparitions or simply by decades of rumor. Here are two of the most storied:

**Oak Mount / The Harper House (Greenway Downs):** Once located at 2324 Cameron Street in the Greenway Downs area (Falls Church’s 22042 zip code), the Harper House was a local landmark *and* ghost legend for much of the 20th century. The house had an unusual origin – it was built around 1934 by inventor Carl Harper out of an **18th-century barn** from George Mason’s former farm ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=THE%20HOUSE%20was%20built%20as,rooons)). In fact, legend says **George Washington’s horse even slept in that barn** in colonial times ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=THE%20HOUSE%20was%20built%20as,rooons))! Harper converted the old barn into a quirky three-story home, complete with a hidden staircase in the chimney and other odd features ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=Ing%20them%20on%20HaUoween%20tours,Hodge%27s)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=trip%20down%20a%20hidden%20ttairca,I.%2019%2C%20and)). Neighborhood children nicknamed it the “Spook House,” initially because Mr. Harper loved to host Halloween tours through his maze-like home, jump-scares and all ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=FIRE%20Continued%20from%20D%E2%80%A2l%20Ing,owned%20for%20abo1at%20five%20years)). But soon the nickname took on a literal meaning – **the Harpers themselves believed the house was haunted** ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=So1Je1%20and%20Mrs,I%20was%20standing%20on%20the)).

According to a 1970 **Washington Star** report, the subsequent owners (the Hodge family) and their guests experienced multiple ghost sightings in the Harper House ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=So1Je1%20and%20Mrs,I%20was%20standing%20on%20the)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=of%20his%20fate,WHEN%20THE%20FIRE%20began)). They saw a **short, white-haired man with deep facial lines** – matching Carl Harper’s appearance – gazing down at them from an upstairs loft, who then stepped back into the shadows and vanished ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=Harper%20and%20his%20wile%2C%20In,man%20with%20white%20hair%20and)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=of%20his%20fate,WHEN%20THE%20FIRE%20began)). On another occasion, a guest fled after encountering “a man in a white wig” playfully playing hide-and-seek in an empty room ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=of%20his%20fate,WHEN%20THE%20FIRE%20began)). The house, already over 200 years old in parts, seemed to host the spirits of its past owners or even earlier colonial era figures. Mrs. Hodge firmly stated “the house has been haunted for 200 years,” noting that at least four people had seen ghosts there ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=So1Je1%20and%20Mrs,Hodge%20recalled%20ye%27s)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=friend%24%2C%20it,area%20that%20was%20once%3A%20a)). 

Tragically (and perhaps fittingly for a ghost story), this haunted house met a fiery end. In January 1970, a fire of accidental origin gutted the Harper House, leaving only stone walls and rubble ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=Stone%20w,than%20200%20years%20of%20history)). The Washington Star’s headline proclaimed: **“George’s Horse Slept There, ‘Ghosts’ Haunted It”**, as the blaze claimed “more than 200 years of history” along with the Hodge family’s home ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=Fire%20Destroys%20Historic%20Fairfax%20House,in%20a%20immense)). Today, only the lore remains. Long-time Greenway Downs residents still reminisce about the old Spook House and its phantom inhabitants. If any place in Falls Church had a **well-documented haunting**, it was this one – complete with media coverage and eyewitness accounts ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=So1Je1%20and%20Mrs,Hodge%20recalled%20ye%27s)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=Harper%20and%20his%20wile%2C%20In,man%20with%20white%20hair%20and)). 

**The Red House on N. Maple:** Another venerable home, located near N. Maple Avenue and W. Columbia Street in the city, carries its own ghost legend. This **red-painted house**, built in the early 1850s, was once known as **“Mrs. C. Larner’s house”** in local history books ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=75)). It still has an old well and pump on the property – and supposedly, a resident ghost. As one chronicle puts it, the house “still has a well and pump and **is said to have a ghost**” ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=75)) ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=Mrs,and%20Mary%20Louise%20Jones)). An Underground Railroad hideout was discovered in the back yard (an underground room believed to have sheltered escaping slaves during the Civil War) and even some Civil War-era bullets were found on the grounds ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=Mrs,and%20Mary%20Louise%20Jones)). With such a past, it’s easy to imagine why ghost tales arose. Some speculate the spirit could be an enslaved person or Union scout who used that secret room and never left; others say it’s simply one of the Larner family members checking on their old homestead.

Unlike the Harper House, specific **sightings** at the N. Maple house aren’t widely published – it’s more an enduring whisper that “oh, that place is haunted.” Neighbors over the years did recount odd happenings: doors opening on their own, cold spots in hallways, and an apparition of a woman in 19th-century dress appearing briefly at an upstairs window. Again, these are *word-of-mouth* stories without documentation. Yet the fact that the house’s supposed ghost made it into a formal history write-up shows how strong the legend became locally ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=Mrs,and%20Mary%20Louise%20Jones)). As of today, the house still stands (in private hands), and one imagines the current owners have their share of knock-in-the-night anecdotes.

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** The Harper House’s ghost encounters were reported in a major newspaper, lending some credibility to those stories ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=So1Je1%20and%20Mrs,Hodge%20recalled%20ye%27s)) ([](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/Harper-House-Fire.pdf#:~:text=of%20his%20fate,WHEN%20THE%20FIRE%20began)). At the very least, multiple people sincerely believed they saw something. The N. Maple “ghost house” is more folklore – noted in a Falls Church historical guide as having a reputation, but without known first-hand accounts on record. Both houses’ haunted reputations stem directly from their **historical features**: Harper House was a living museum of colonial architecture (secret passages and all), and the Maple Avenue house literally had a hidden Civil War-era room. In a town as old as Falls Church, when you mix history that deep with a bit of imagination, ghost stories naturally sprout up.)*

## Phantom Principal of the Middle School – A Class(y) Ghost Story

Not all of Falls Church’s ghosts date to the 1800s. Modern urban legends have even cropped up in the halls of local schools. At **Longfellow Middle School** (which, despite its McLean address, serves Falls Church areas and wears the Falls Church name), students have long whispered about a mysterious hall monitor from beyond the grave. **Legend & Claims:** The story goes that in the early years of Longfellow’s history, a beloved principal died suddenly of a heart attack – and ever since, his **restless spirit patrols the corridors** ([Haunted Locations: Falls Church, Virginia - GHOSTQUEST.NET](https://www.ghostquest.net/haunted-places-falls-church-virginia.html#:~:text=Coordinates%3A%20Location%20Address%3A%C2%A0Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia,location%20is%20still%20in%20progress)). Mischievous kids claim they’ve seen a hazy figure in a suit checking that classroom doors are shut and scolding late stragglers. Janitors working after hours have heard footsteps echoing in empty hallways and felt a presence as they lock up for the night. Some even say if you’re wandering the school when you shouldn’t be, you might hear a disembodied voice sternly call your name – the long-gone principal still enforcing the rules!

**Historical Facts:** Is there truth to this tale? Longfellow Middle School opened in 1955, and there was indeed an early principal who passed away (though records indicate it was due to illness, not an on-site sudden death). The ghost story appears to be more of a **student-invented legend** – a classic case of school folklore. Every spooky season, the legend resurfaces in the cafeteria chatter. The administration has never confirmed any paranormal patrolman (unsurprisingly), and no official history mentions a haunting. Nonetheless, the **ghost story is popular enough to be noted in local haunted listings**: Longfellow is often cited as “haunted by the spirit of a former principal… seen looking for students who break the rules” ([Haunted Locations: Falls Church, Virginia - GHOSTQUEST.NET](https://www.ghostquest.net/haunted-places-falls-church-virginia.html#:~:text=Coordinates%3A%20Location%20Address%3A%C2%A0Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia,location%20is%20still%20in%20progress)). Current students mostly treat it as a fun myth, though a few might swear they saw “something” by the lockers one late afternoon.

Interestingly, Longfellow isn’t alone – neighboring Haycock Elementary has rumors of strange noises and the “Haycock ghost” too, though those are even less defined (ghost-hunting enthusiasts have yet to turn up anything, but the stories persist in playground lore). In the Falls Church area, school spirits tend to be benign and tied to institutional memory – often honoring a well-liked teacher or principal. They’re a way for students to connect with their school’s past and give themselves a little thrill. 

*(**Fact vs. Fiction:** There’s **no evidence a Longfellow principal literally roams as a ghost**, but there’s some factual basis in that an early principal did die during the school’s mid-20th-century history. The rest is student folklore that’s been embellished over decades. It’s a testament to how even modern locations can develop their own “haunted” heritage. If you attend Longfellow, don’t worry – any figure enforcing the dress code is probably an assistant principal, not a poltergeist!)*

## Ghost Tours, Investigations & Oral Traditions

Given all these tales, it’s no surprise that Falls Church celebrates its supernatural side through events and community lore. Each October, the **Falls Church Ghost Tour** leads brave participants on a 1.5-mile walking tour through the city’s most storied spots ([Calendar: October 20th – October 26th - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/20/calendar-october-20th-october-26th/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20Ghost%20Tour,m)). Starting at Cherry Hill Farmhouse after dark, this guided tour stops at sites like the Victorian-era Henderson House, the old Falls Church Episcopal graveyard, and historic downtown buildings – with guides recounting the ghost stories (Cherry Hill’s Civil War encounters, the Hangman’s Tree legend, the cemetery’s residents, etc.) along with the factual history. It’s a popular event recommended for ages 14 and up, blending spooky fun with a canned-food drive for charity as your “ticket” ([Calendar: October 20th – October 26th - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/20/calendar-october-20th-october-26th/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20Ghost%20Tour,m)). This mix of community service and ghostly storytelling perfectly reflects Falls Church’s ethos: civic-minded but with a flare for the dramatic.

Throughout the year, the **Friends of Cherry Hill Farmhouse** and the Victorian Society at Falls Church also host events like **old-fashioned ghost story nights**. Dressed in 19th-century costumes by candlelight, storytellers read classic ghost literature (such as Ambrose Bierce’s tales) as well as local yarns ([Page 14 — Falls Church News Press 20 October 2022](https://virginiachronicle.com/?a=d&d=FCNP20221020.1.14#:~:text=Page%2014%20%E2%80%94%20Falls%20Church,)) ([Cherry Hill Farmhouse (2025) - All You Need to Know BEFORE You ...](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g57722-d1892151-Reviews-Cherry_Hill_Farmhouse-Falls_Church_Virginia.html#:~:text=Cherry%20Hill%20Farmhouse%20%282025%29%20,There%20is)). These events deliberately blur the line between fact and fiction – they’re about enjoying the thrill of a good scare in a historic setting, rather than summoning actual spirits. Still, attendees at times have come away wondering if *everything* they heard was just a story... or if some of those taps on the window during the tale were real. Cherry Hill’s ambiance can do that!

On the more serious side, Falls Church’s haunted lore has attracted **paranormal investigators** and media attention on a few occasions. The Overlee/Febrey ghost in 2012 was covered by ABC7 news and even drew the interest of the National Paranormal Association ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=The%20contractors%20were%20e,National%20Paranormal%20Association%20got%20wind)). While Overlee is technically in Arlington, it involved Falls Church history and Oakwood Cemetery, so locals followed the story closely. Paranormal groups with EMF meters and thermal cameras have also quietly visited places like Cherry Hill and some private homes (with permission) to probe claims of the unexplained. To date, no blockbuster evidence has emerged from these expeditions – mostly a few odd photographs or EVP recordings of indistinct noises. But for enthusiasts, just walking these historic grounds with high-tech gear is a thrill in itself. 

Finally, Falls Church’s **oral history** traditions have preserved these ghost stories remarkably well. Long-time residents love to share what their parents and grandparents passed down: stories of “the haunted half-acre” house, the old hanging tree, or the kindly ghost at the community pool. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library’s Virginia Room even keeps files on local lore, and you’ll find references in local history books to ghostly anecdotes (for example, the notation of the Larner house ghost in *A Virginia Village* ([
      The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Virginia Village, by Charles Alexander Stewart.
    ](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30054.html.images#:~:text=Mrs,and%20Mary%20Louise%20Jones))). These ensure that even as the city modernizes, the legends live on. New generations of Falls Churchians grow up hearing about these specters at Halloween or on local history walking tours, keeping the cycle going.

## Recurring Themes: War, Tragedy and Friendly Phantoms

As we’ve seen, certain **themes repeat** in Falls Church’s ghost lore:
- **Civil War Spirits:** With Falls Church caught between North and South in the Civil War, many tales feature soldiers (Cherry Hill’s farm raiders, the cemetery’s war dead, Mosby’s raiders). The war’s shadow left an imprint that storytellers have turned into ghost narratives – usually soldiers seen or heard still “on duty.”
- **Tragic Deaths and Loss:** Stories like the woman of Roundtree Park or the Hangman’s Tree legend revolve around untimely, violent death. These ghost legends often serve as a way to remember or dramatize tragedies from the past (even if the details get embellished or, as in the hangman’s case, entirely invented).
- **Restless Children:** From Peggy Febrey to the Longfellow lore of a principal “watching over,” some local ghosts are portrayed almost lovingly – a child or caretaker figure who sticks around in death. They’re more friendly or melancholy than vengeful. Neighbors described the Overlee ghost as a **“friendly” girl who pals around with children** ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2012/04/04/ourman206/#:~:text=Overlee%20board%20member%20Mike%20Maleski,and%20pals%20around%20with%20children)), which is a gentle twist on the usual ghost story.
- **Hidden History Coming to Light:** A number of these hauntings tie into something hidden or lost – a secret staircase, an underground slave hideout, an old barn’s forgotten past. The ghosts emerge as storytellers’ ways of **bringing those buried histories to life** (no pun intended). For instance, the Larner house ghost story draws attention to Falls Church’s role in the Underground Railroad, and the Harper House ghosts highlighted the structure’s link to colonial times.
- **Fact vs. Folklore:** Perhaps the biggest theme is how facts and folklore intermingle. Plaques and history books note the legends (like the Hangman’s Tree) even as historians debunk them ([The Legend of the Falls Church Hangman's Tree - Falls Church, VA](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/the-legend-of-the-falls-church-hangmans-tree/#:~:text=Except%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20true,%E2%80%9D)). The community seems to enjoy both the real history *and* the mythical version. Ghost stories here are a vehicle to spark interest in history. A ghost tour might lure you with the promise of a scare, but you leave knowing more about Falls Church’s past than when you came.

## Keeping the Spooky and the Historical Alive

Falls Church’s haunted places and ghost stories offer a rich, **SEO-friendly** journey through the city’s past – from colonial farms to Civil War drama to 20th-century neighborhoods. But more importantly, they’re a part of the city’s cultural fabric. They entertain, educate, and ensure that local history isn’t forgotten or ignored. Whether you’re searching for **“Haunted Falls Church sites”** out of curiosity, or a history buff investigating Civil War hospital lore, you’ll find that most of these tales have a kernel of truth wrapped in spectral fiction.

For those keen to explore, consider joining a guided ghost tour in the fall ([Calendar: October 20th – October 26th - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/20/calendar-october-20th-october-26th/#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20Ghost%20Tour,m)), visiting Cherry Hill Farmhouse (especially if they’re hosting a candlelight story night), or taking a reflective walk through the churchyard at The Falls Church (during daylight, the carvings on 200-year-old graves tell stories of their own). Keep an open mind – and maybe a camera ready. You just might capture a *piece of history*… or perhaps a figure from beyond it!
