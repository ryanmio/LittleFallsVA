# The Renaming of J.E.B. Stuart High School to Justice High School

## Early History and Origins of the Renaming Movement

 ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B. Stuart High School : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560034586/virginia-school-board-set-to-rename-j-e-b-stuart-high-school)) *J.E.B. Stuart High School’s façade bore the Confederate general’s name for nearly six decades. The school opened in 1959 with a Falls Church address, at a time when Virginia’s leaders were resisting federally mandated school integration ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Alumni%20for%20Change%20was%20launched,%E2%80%9Cmassive%20resistance%E2%80%9D%20against%20racial%20integration)).* In the late 1950s, Fairfax County’s school board chose to name the new high school after Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart, a decision widely seen as a symbolic stand against the *Brown v. Board of Education* ruling that called for desegregation ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Alumni%20for%20Change%20was%20launched,%E2%80%9Cmassive%20resistance%E2%80%9D%20against%20racial%20integration)) ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=McQuail%2C%20who%20is%20white%20and,around%20the%20stadium%2C%20she%20says)). For years, the school community lived with Confederate imagery: in the 1970s, its sports teams were called the “Stuart Raiders,” Confederate flags adorned uniforms, and a student dressed as a Rebel soldier would ride a horse around the stadium after touchdowns ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=McQuail%2C%20who%20is%20white%20and,around%20the%20stadium%2C%20she%20says)). Black alumni recall that era as a *“pageant of hate”* – they felt unwelcome at their own school and even experienced racially charged clashes, including a 1974 incident that escalated into a “race riot” requiring police intervention ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Confederate%20flags%20on%20football%20uniforms%2C,around%20the%20stadium%2C%20she%20says)) ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=By%201974%2C%20there%20was%20a,enough%20because%20so%20much%20damage)). 

Community unease with the Stuart name simmered for decades, but no concerted effort to change it took hold until the 2010s. In 2015, a catalyst for action emerged in the wake of a tragic event far from Falls Church: the murder of nine Black parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina, by an avowed racist bent on Confederate symbolism ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=School%20renaming%20proposals%20throughout%20the,by%20an%20avowed%20racist%20who)). This national reckoning with Confederate flags and monuments spurred reflection in Fairfax County. That summer, a group of J.E.B. Stuart High School students learned in history class about the origin of their school’s name and were disturbed by its association with “racism, inequality, and oppression” ([Stuart community members urge school board to change school's ...](https://peopledemandingaction.org/privacy-policy/item/465-stuart-community-members-urge-school-board-to-change-school-s-name#:~:text=,oppression%2C%E2%80%9D%20Stuart%20senior%20Lidia)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Five seniors – Anna Rowan, Lidia Amanuel, Cassie Marcotty, Abby Conde, and Marley Finley – decided it was time for a change ([Opposition to J.E.B.

They quietly began organizing a campaign in 2015 to *“rid Fairfax County Public Schools of names honoring the Confederacy and segregation”* ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=School%2C%20reflected%20the%20school%20board%27s,19)). These students researched the school’s history and created a YouTube video explaining why continuing to honor a Confederate general was inappropriate in their diverse, modern community ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20was%20very%20impressed%20with,change%20is%20on%20You%20Tube)) ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20petition%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe,that%20were%2C%20by%20court%20order)). Their message resonated: as one student put it, *“students...deserve a school name that represents something more germane to where we are today”* rather than a name *“recycled in the 1950s for a hateful purpose”* during segregation ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20petition%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe,that%20were%2C%20by%20court%20order)).

## Student and Alumni Push for Change

What began as a student project quickly grew into a broader movement. By mid-2015, teachers, parents, and alumni – including some of the school’s most prominent graduates – rallied behind the cause ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=Initially%2C%20there%20was%20a%20groundswell,of%20those%20came%20from%20people)). An alumni-led group called “Stuart Alumni for Change” launched an online petition that summer, and within weeks it had over a thousand signatures from around the country ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=other%20individuals%20who%20believe%20a,keeping%20the%20name%2C%E2%80%9D%20Evans%20says)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Academy Award-winning actress **Julianne Moore** and Oscar-winning producer **Bruce Cohen**, both of whom had attended Stuart High, lent star power to the effort by starting their own petition on Change.org ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B. Stuart High School : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560034586/virginia-school-board-set-to-rename-j-e-b-stuart-high-school#:~:text=The%20most%20famous%20people%20on,)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

By the following year, Moore and Cohen’s petition had amassed nearly **35,000** supporters nationwide ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Local alumni from the 1970s, such as **Lisa McQuail (Class of ’78)** and **Jeff Parker (’75)**, helped found the “Alumni for Change” campaign and provided historical context for why the name felt so wrong ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Alumni%20for%20Change%20was%20launched,%E2%80%9Cmassive%20resistance%E2%80%9D%20against%20racial%20integration)). Parker, a historian, pointed out that J.E.B. Stuart High School’s naming occurred during Virginia’s official policy of “**massive resistance**” to integration – evidence, he argued, that the school’s very identity was entwined with defiance of civil rights ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Alumni%20for%20Change%20was%20launched,%E2%80%9Cmassive%20resistance%E2%80%9D%20against%20racial%20integration)). McQuail and others shared personal stories of how Black students and those supporting integration had been marginalized at Stuart in decades past ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=McQuail%2C%20who%20is%20white%20and,around%20the%20stadium%2C%20she%20says)) ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=and%20were%20not%20eligible%20for,or%20other%20activities%2C%20McQuail%20recalls)). Even some with Confederate ancestors, like McQuail, felt the school’s tribute to a Confederate general only served to *“legitimize racial hatred”* and intimidate minority students ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Superintendent%20W,integration)) ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20pageant%20of%20hate%20was,%E2%80%9D)). Their advocacy, alongside the students’, reframed the issue not as *erasing* history but as *correcting* an injustice – asserting that a community as diverse as Falls Church’s Stuart pyramid should not honor a man who fought **against** the United States to preserve slavery ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Last%20Thursday%E2%80%99s%20meeting%20began%20with,over%20the%20past%20two%20years)) ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

The Fairfax County chapter of the **NAACP** also joined the push for a name change ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=Hollywood%20film%20director%20and%20producer,the%20Fairfax%20County%20NAACP%20chapter)). Civil rights leaders argued that continuing to honor Confederate icons in public schools sent a harmful message to students of color. By late 2015, the momentum was clearly on the side of the “**Changers**,” as supporters of renaming came to be called ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Last%20Thursday%E2%80%99s%20meeting%20began%20with,over%20the%20past%20two%20years)). *“Our diversity is our strength,”* one student declared, noting that over half of Stuart’s students were minorities and many were recent immigrants or descendants of people historically oppressed by the Confederacy ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=In%202001%2C%20Justice%20High%20School,24)) ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=In%201959%20when%20the%20school,19)). To them, replacing the name was about ensuring **all** students felt welcome and respected in their school. 

## Community Debate: Supporters vs. Opponents

Not everyone in the community agreed that the name should be changed. As news of the student-led initiative spread in 2015 and 2016, a vocal opposition camp – soon nicknamed the “**Keepers**” – emerged to argue against tampering with tradition ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Last%20Thursday%E2%80%99s%20meeting%20began%20with,over%20the%20past%20two%20years)) ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

These opponents of the change included some alumni, parents, and local residents who felt pride in the school’s long-standing name or saw the renaming effort as an overreach of political correctness. In fact, an online counter-petition to *“retain the existing names of Fairfax County schools”* gained over **2,000** signatures, slightly outpacing the early pro-change petition, and reflecting a sizable constituency favoring tradition ([Name change proposed for Stuart HS | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/name-change-proposed-for-stuart-hs/#:~:text=the%20landmark%20Brown%20v,of%20Education%20case%20in%201954)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

By mid-2016, an organized group called **Concerned Citizens of Fairfax** had formed specifically to fight the Stuart renaming, packing community meetings with supporters ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=But%20the%20most%20recent%20developments,oppose%20the%20name%20change%20effort)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

At a May 2016 forum hosted at Stuart High, these citizens made their presence known, helping push the narrative that the renaming “battle” would be *messy* and contentious ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=Opposition%20to%20the%20effort%20to,process%20about%20the%20name%20change)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Opponents offered several arguments. **Historical context** was a common theme: some argued that judging a 1950s naming decision by today’s standards was unfair. *“I’m dismayed people engage in presentism instead of thoroughly studying history,”* said **Denise Patton-Pace**, a local resident and former history teacher, criticizing the idea of renaming as an attempt to *“erase the past”* ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B. Stuart High School : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560034586/virginia-school-board-set-to-rename-j-e-b-stuart-high-school#:~:text=Denise%20Patton%2C%20a%20former%20history,trying%20to%20erase%20the%20past)) ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

She and others insisted that those who chose the name in 1959 *“should not be thought of as racist,”* suggesting the school might have simply been honoring a famous Virginian without malicious intent ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B. Stuart High School : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560034586/virginia-school-board-set-to-rename-j-e-b-stuart-high-school#:~:text=Patton%20is%20known%20as%20a,be%20thought%20of%20as%20racist)). Several opponents also questioned whether there was clear evidence that J.E.B. Stuart High School was named *specifically* to spite integration efforts. *“We’d like to know if that’s true,”* said **Andre Billeaudeaux**, a Stuart parent active in the Concerned Citizens group, referring to claims that Stuart’s name was part of white resistance to desegregation. *“If he [Gen. Stuart] is known to have killed or slaughtered slaves, then hell yeah, change the name,”* Billeaudeaux told a reporter, *“[but] it’d be nice to see...more substantive [evidence] than an opinion.”* ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=According%20to%20Billeaudeaux%2C%20those%20pushing,the%20school%E2%80%99s%20opening%20in%201959)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Other opponents took a more **pragmatic stance**, voicing concerns about cost and community disruption. Renaming a large public high school would require changing building signage, sports uniforms, logos, the school mascot, and countless documents – an expense estimated anywhere from **$600,000** to nearly **$1 million** ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Sept,the%20private%20citizens%2C%20totaling%20%24933%2C916)) ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

They argued these funds could be better spent on educational programs or facility improvements. Additionally, some current students saw the issue differently from the original five who launched the campaign. One Latino junior at Stuart, **Nicholas Menacho**, said he and many classmates of color *did not feel offended* by the name “Stuart” in day-to-day life ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=Another%20person%20who%20opposes%20the,that%20it%20did%20in%201959)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

In a striking comment, he added, *“it seems like most of the people who are for the name change are white people,”* implying that some minority community members did not prioritize the issue ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=doesn%E2%80%99t%20offend%20,kind%20of%20lost%20its%20value)). This sentiment added nuance to the debate: while many students of color did support the change, not all felt it was necessary, and opponents seized on that ambivalence.

Throughout 2016 and 2017, public meetings on the renaming grew heated. **Raucous community forums** saw “Changers” and “Keepers” facing off with passionate speeches ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B. Stuart High School : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560034586/virginia-school-board-set-to-rename-j-e-b-stuart-high-school#:~:text=The%20debate%20has%20dragged%20on,forums%20and%20testy%20board%20meetings)). Those favoring the change argued that *“naming a school after someone who fought against the U.S. and for the enslavement of African-Americans”* was simply immoral and had no place in an inclusive public school ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

Both sides accused the other of ignorance or bad faith at times, and the controversy began to fracture the Falls Church-area community. By the summer of 2017, even some who initially might have been sympathetic to the change voiced frustration at how divisive the issue had become. *“Social change is never easy…It’s always a difficult fight,”* Bruce Cohen remarked, *“and sadly I sort of expected the opposition”* ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=opposition)). Emotions ran high, but the stage was set for the Fairfax County School Board to step in and make the ultimate decision.

## Fairfax County School Board’s Renaming Process

Facing growing pressure from students, alumni, and advocacy groups by late 2015, Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) began formally grappling with the issue of Confederate school names. In **December 2015**, the School Board voted to revise its naming policy (Regulation 8170) to explicitly allow changing a school’s name *“in the case of a compelling need,”* a step taken *“in light of the Stuart issue”* ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20Keepers%E2%80%99%20latter,that%20due%20process%20was%20followed)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

This was uncharted territory – no sitting FCPS board had ever renamed an existing school for ideological reasons – so the board proceeded cautiously. In **February 2016**, the board directed Superintendent Karen Garza to initiate a community engagement process in the Stuart High School pyramid (the cluster of schools in its feeder pattern) to gauge support for a name change ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=In%20February%202016%2C%20the%20Fairfax,for%20a%20person%20of%20color)). An initial **survey** of parents, students, staff, alumni, and neighbors that spring drew thousands of responses. The results revealed a split: about **56%** of respondents said they did **not** support changing the name, while 44% supported or were open to it ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=But%20the%20most%20recent%20developments,oppose%20the%20name%20change%20effort)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

This narrow majority against the change emboldened the “Keepers,” but the Board saw enough division – and enough moral urgency from the advocates – to keep the conversation going.

**Key Steps in the Official Process:** *(2016–2017)*

- **July 28, 2016 – Ad Hoc Committee Formed:** The School Board established a special committee of students, parents, alumni, community leaders, and business representatives to study the Stuart name issue from all angles ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=On%20July%2028%2C%202016%2C%20the,School%20Board%20in%20May%202017)). This ad hoc committee was tasked with outlining pros and cons of a name change, measuring community support, exploring funding options (including private donations) to defray costs, and recommending how and when a change might be implemented ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=On%20July%2028%2C%202016%2C%20the,School%20Board%20in%20May%202017)). Over the next several months, the committee held meetings and even broke into subgroups to tackle these topics in depth. They gathered historical research, community input, and cost estimates, ultimately submitting seven separate reports to the Board in May 2017 ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=parents%2C%20community%20members%2C%20alumni%2C%20and,School%20Board%20in%20May%202017)). (The sheer volume of reports – and the fact that the committee splintered into subcommittees – later caused some consternation among Board members, a few of whom felt the process had become *“balkanized”* and opaque ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

- **July 27, 2017 – Board Vote to Change the Name:** After reviewing the ad hoc committee’s findings and a two-year community debate, the School Board brought the question to a head in a dramatic meeting at Luther Jackson Middle School. That evening, dozens of citizen speakers from both camps made last-minute pleas, reiterating arguments about morality versus tradition ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

In a tense twist, a few Board members sympathetic to the “Keepers” introduced a substitute motion to **delay** any decision until at least October 2017, seeking more time to clarify the definitions of *“compelling need,” “sufficient support,”* and *“community”* in the new naming policy ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

After 90 minutes of debate, the delay motion narrowly failed, 6-5 ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

The Board then voted on the original motion put forth by Mason District representative **Sandy Evans** (who represented the Stuart HS area and had championed the renaming cause). Evans had added a late **addendum** to her motion – a concession to moderates – specifying that the name change could be achieved by *simply dropping “J.E.B.” and keeping “Stuart”* as the school’s name if desired ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

With that compromise option on the table, the Board voted **7–2** (with **2 abstentions**) in favor of changing J.E.B. Stuart High School’s name by the start of the 2019 school year ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

The vote drew cheers from many “Changers” in the audience and consternation from “Keepers,” some of whom walked out fuming about the process. At-large Board member Ryan McElveen acknowledged afterward that *“this was the first time a school name change has ever been considered by [this] Board, and it was a learning experience”* ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

- **September 2017 – Community Input on New Name:** With the decision to rename made, FCPS turned to selecting **what** the new name would be. The Board scheduled two public meetings at Stuart High to involve the community in this step. On **September 9, 2017**, an open forum at the school allowed any and all suggestions for new names – more than **70** distinct names were proposed by students, parents, alumni, and neighbors ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=On%20July%2027%2C%202017%2C%20the,them%20as%20his%20recommendations%20to)). One week later, on **September 16**, residents of the school’s attendance area participated in a day-long **community vote** to rank their top three choices from that list ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=On%20July%2027%2C%202017%2C%20the,them%20as%20his%20recommendations%20to)) ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=Board%E2%80%99s%20decision%2C%20two%20community%20meetings,Board%20on%20September%2028%2C%202017)). Each household in the area was allowed one ballot (a rule that caused some debate, since it didn’t weight voting by population) ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=On%20September%2016%2C%202017%2C%20residents,already%20a%20Marshall%20High%20School)).

When the ballots were tallied under a point system (5 points for a first-choice vote, 3 for second, 1 for third), the **results were surprising**: the top vote-getter was *“Stuart”* – essentially retaining the current name minus the Confederate general’s initials ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=On%20September%2016%2C%202017%2C%20residents,decided%20to%20change%20the%20name)) ([Stuart High Renaming: Total Name Change Costs $800K | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/stuart-high-renaming-total-name-change-costs-800k#:~:text=When%20the%20school%20board%20voted,cost%20of%20a%20name%20change)). “Stuart/Stuart Raiders” earned 917 points, indicating many households ranked it as their first choice despite the Board’s decision to remove J.E.B.

- **October 26, 2017 – Final Vote on the New Name:** In late October, after another round of passionate public comments and deliberation, the School Board met to decide the new name. By this point, the deadly August 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA – over the removal of a Confederate statue – hung heavy in the background, reinforcing for some Board members the importance of moving away from Confederate honors ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

At the October 26 meeting, members debated options including **“Stuart High School”** (the community’s top pick for minimizing change) and **“Justice Thurgood Marshall High School.”** Board member **Karen Keys-Gamarra** argued forcefully that after Charlottesville’s trauma, *“we need to make a clean break from the past”* – she favored renaming Stuart for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a hero of the civil rights era, and shortening it to “Justice High School” in usage ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

Others, like member **Karen Corbett Sanders**, pushed the compromise of simply dropping “J.E.B.”; *“I fully believe we should take the name J.E.B. off... I would like to see us consider combining names,”* Corbett Sanders said, suggesting that keeping *Stuart* could be a middle ground ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

In the end, the Board voted **7–4** to select **“Justice High School”** as the new name, rejecting the option to retain Stuart altogether ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=On%20October%2026%2C%202017%2C%20the,was%20implemented%20in%20summer%202018)). One Board member described “Justice” as a *“compromise name”* – not named after a single person, but rather an ideal that could collectively honor multiple figures associated with justice ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=On%20October%2026%2C%202017%2C%20the,was%20implemented%20in%20summer%202018)). The decision was made that the change would take effect by the start of the 2018–19 school year, and indeed the name officially changed on July 1, 2018 ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=4%20,6)) (['Justice' replaces J.E.B.

## Choosing the Name “Justice High School”

The name **“Justice High School”** was deliberately chosen to transcend the polarizing debate over which single individual deserved the honor. Rather than rename J.E.B. Stuart High after one person (as nearby schools had been named for Generals or Presidents), the Board opted for a virtue – *Justice* – that would reflect the values of inclusion and equality they wanted the school to stand for ([Confederate High School Name Dropped For 'Justice' | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/confederate-high-school-name-dropped-justice#:~:text=The%20school%27s%20new%20name%20is,equality%20in%20the%20United%20States)). Importantly, the name “Justice” was also intended as an homage to **three** individuals put forward by the community during the process: **Justice Thurgood Marshall**, **Barbara Rose Johns**, and **Col. Louis Gonzaga Mendez, Jr.** ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=On%20October%2026%2C%202017%2C%20the,was%20implemented%20in%20summer%202018)) ([Confederate High School Name Dropped For 'Justice' | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/confederate-high-school-name-dropped-justice#:~:text=The%20school%27s%20new%20name%20is,equality%20in%20the%20United%20States)). *Each* of these figures had a connection to the ideals of civil rights or to the local area:
- **Thurgood Marshall** – the first Black Supreme Court Justice, who as an NAACP lawyer argued *Brown v. Board of Education* and helped dismantle school segregation ([Virginia School Board Set To Rename J.E.B.

(Marshall also happened to have been the first African-American resident of the nearby Lake Barcroft community in Falls Church, making his name resonate locally ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=The%20students%20called%20Marshall%20a,his%20wife%20still%20lives%20there)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=demanding%20we%20truly%20live%20up,his%20wife%20still%20lives%20there)).)
- **Barbara Rose Johns** – a Virginia civil rights icon, just a teenager in 1951 when she led a student strike against segregated schools in Prince Edward County. Her courageous stand was one of the cases consolidated into *Brown v. Board*, and it underscored how youth activism can advance justice ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=That%20led%20to%20the%20NAACP,was%20combined%20with%20similar%20cases)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=into%20the%20Supreme%20Court%E2%80%99s%20landmark,%E2%80%9D)).
- **Col. Louis G. Mendez, Jr.** – a highly decorated World War II veteran of Hispanic and Native American heritage who settled in the Falls Church area after serving his country ([Col. Louis Gonzaga Mendez... - Arlington National Cemetery](https://www.facebook.com/ArlingtonNatl/posts/col-louis-gonzaga-mendez-jr-was-a-decorated-airborne-world-war-ii-combat-veteran/922518459909185/#:~:text=Cemetery%20www,commander%20of%20the%203rd)).

He too was a Lake Barcroft resident and symbolized the contributions of minorities to American freedom.

By selecting “Justice,” the Board ensured that all three – Marshall, Johns, and Mendez – would be honored, without having to choose one over another. *“The name Justice was chosen to honor three individuals for their roles in championing equal rights, inclusivity, and justice for all,”* FCPS explained in its announcement ([Becoming Justice High School | Justice High School](https://justicehs.fcps.edu/about/history/becoming#:~:text=On%20October%2026%2C%202017%2C%20the,on%20Friday%2C%20September%207%2C%202018)). Sandy Evans, the Mason District board member, called it a name that *“most anybody can get behind”* ([Confederate High School Name Dropped For 'Justice' | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/confederate-high-school-name-dropped-justice#:~:text=The%20school%27s%20new%20name%20is,equality%20in%20the%20United%20States)). The idea was that **justice** is a universal value, and a school named for Justice could serve as a daily reminder of the principles of fairness and equality, rather than a reminder of civil war divisions. 

In practical terms, choosing “Justice” also avoided confusion with another Fairfax County school – Marshall High School (named after George C. Marshall) – which was a concern when “Thurgood Marshall High” was floated ([Justice High School - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_High_School#:~:text=members.,21)). And it addressed the cost issue: while not as cheap as keeping “Stuart,” the change to “Justice” meant the school could reuse some generic branding (like the word “High School” on gear) and potentially garner private donations from supportive community members to offset new signage costs ([Stuart High Renaming: Total Name Change Costs $800K | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/stuart-high-renaming-total-name-change-costs-800k#:~:text=When%20the%20school%20board%20voted,cost%20of%20a%20name%20change)) ([Stuart High Renaming: Total Name Change Costs $800K | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/stuart-high-renaming-total-name-change-costs-800k#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20being%20presented,while%20keeping%20Stuart%20costs%20%24512%2C572)). In the months following the vote, FCPS developed an implementation plan. Students were invited to help choose a **new mascot** – they voted to become the **Justice Wolves**, retiring the old “Raiders” mascot that had Confederate connotations (['Justice' replaces J.E.B.

By January 2018 the wolf logo and mascot were announced, and over the summer the school grounds and buildings were updated: new signage reading “Justice High School” went up on the school’s brick facade, banners with the wolf logo were hung from lampposts, and even the marquee out front was replaced (['Justice' replaces J.E.B.

## Reactions and Legacy in the Falls Church Community

The renaming of J.E.B. Stuart High School to Justice High School marked a historic moment for the Falls Church area, and reactions poured in from all sides. **Supporters** of the change celebrated it as a long-overdue step toward inclusivity and a powerful statement of community values. At the official rededication ceremony on September 7, 2018, students and local leaders spoke about how the new name reflects the school’s diverse and welcoming spirit ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20diversity%20is%20our%20strength%2C%E2%80%9D,from%20more%20than%2020%20countries)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=said%20Justice%20High%20School%E2%80%99s%20new,from%20more%20than%2020%20countries)). Several student speakers recounted the stories of Marshall, Johns, and Mendez – the figures behind “Justice” – underscoring the school’s new identity as one honoring those who fought for equality ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=Marshall%20argued%20Brown%20v,Alicia%20Gendell%2C%20and%20Kevin%20Ma)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=Michael%20Jimenez%20Sandoval%2C%20Jasmin%20Martinez%2C,earned%20a%20Distinguished%20Service%20Cross)). The school’s principal, **Maria Eck**, addressed an auditorium full of students, families, and alumni, proudly saying, *“Our diversity is our strength... All of you are welcome, regardless of where you’re from or how you arrived.”* ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20diversity%20is%20our%20strength%2C%E2%80%9D,from%20more%20than%2020%20countries)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=said%20Justice%20High%20School%E2%80%99s%20new,from%20more%20than%2020%20countries)). U.S. Congressman **Gerry Connolly** (who represents Fairfax County) took the stage as well, praising the students and community for choosing a name that stands for *“the freedom from the segregation ages in our history”* and for adding *“a new page... to the pages of our history books”* ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=September%2010%2C%202018%20at%201%3A34,am)). Such endorsements from elected officials and civil rights groups signaled broad support in Northern Virginia’s political circles for the move. The *Washington Post* and other media outlets covered the first day of classes at “Justice High” in fall 2018, noting the sense of renewal felt by many students walking into a building no longer bearing a Confederate general’s name. 

Many **students and alumni** expressed pride in the new name. The Class of 2019 became the first to graduate from Justice High School, and some seniors wore stoles or buttons honoring the change. *“A public high school in today’s age should not be named after a Confederate general,”* Bruce Cohen had remarked back in 2016, *“It should not be linked to...the Confederate [past].”* ([Opposition to J.E.B.

Actress Julianne Moore tweeted her congratulations to her alma mater for “embracing Justice.” The local Falls Church **News-Press** lauded the Board’s decision as *“historic”* and in line with a *“growing national attitude that Confederate emblems are not fit to adorn public spaces.”* ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Last%20week%E2%80%99s%20decision%20by%20the,a%20prolonged%20road%20to%20recovery)) ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

Indeed, there remained **critical voices** even after the name change was official. Some “Keepers” in the community accepted the outcome but not the reasoning. A few parents pulled donations or support from the school in quiet protest of what they considered a politically driven decision. Others shifted their focus to ensuring the cost of the change did not drain resources from students – and in fact, thanks to private fundraising and alumni contributions, a significant portion of the nearly $800,000 cost was covered without cutting school programs ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B. Stuart High Spurs New Dialogue - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/08/02/historic-decision-change-name-j-e-b-stuart-high-spurs-new-dialogue/#:~:text=Sept,the%20private%20citizens%2C%20totaling%20%24933%2C916)) ([Historic Decision to Change Name of J.E.B.

A small number of opponents continued to argue in letters to editors and on social media that the Board had ignored the majority community wish (since the most popular vote option was “Stuart”) and that a non-local influence (signatures from around the country) had swayed the process ([Opposition to J.E.B. Stuart Name Change Gains Steam - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2016/05/24/opposition-j-e-b-stuart-name-change-gains-steam/#:~:text=opposition%20seemed%20to%20be%20expressing,will%20ultimately%20be%20decided%20locally)) ([Opposition to J.E.B.

But these voices grew quieter with time. By the one-year anniversary of the change, the new name had largely been embraced or at least accepted by students and staff. Hallways once decorated in Confederate red and gray were repainted in Justice High’s new colors of navy and silver, and trophy cases began filling with awards engraved with the Wolves moniker ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=The%20Wolves%20have%20already%20proven,trophy%20for%20Justice%20High%20School)). 

The **Falls Church-area community**, known for its cultural diversity, has in many ways turned the page. The school still serves the same neighborhoods – Sleepy Hollow, Lake Barcroft, Seven Corners – but now with a name that many feel better represents the values of those communities. In a county and region that continue to grapple with historical legacies, Justice High School stands as an example of how residents confronted that legacy head-on. *“When our democracy is fully respected in the community, everybody wins,”* one community member commented after the rededication, calling the change a collective achievement of activists, students, and leaders working together ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=September%2010%2C%202018%20at%201%3A34,am)) ([Justice High School rededicated at ceremony honoring Marshall, Johns, and Mendez | Annandale Today](https://annandaletoday.com/justice-high-school-rededicated-at/#:~:text=Congratulations%20to%20all%20,Go%2C%20Justice%2C%20Go)). The journey from J.E.B. Stuart to Justice was tumultuous and emotional, but it sparked a deep dialogue about history and inclusion in Falls Church. In the end, the old Raiders mascot was laid to rest, a new wolf mascot roams the sidelines, and Justice High School moves forward – carrying a new name, and a renewed commitment to the idea that *“justice for all”* is more than just a phrase, but a principle worth upholding on the front of a school building.

Key individuals publicly associated with the anti-name change ("Keepers") movement for J.E.B. Stuart High School included:

1. **Denise Patton-Pace** – Local resident and former history teacher who prominently spoke out against the renaming, arguing against "presentism" and "erasure of history."

2. **Andre Billeaudeaux** – A Stuart parent active in the "Concerned Citizens of Fairfax," questioning historical evidence used by proponents of the name change.

3. **Vince Nettuno** – Leader within the "Concerned Citizens of Fairfax," prominently featured in opposition campaigns, arguing that the original name was not intentionally racist and should be preserved for tradition.

4. **Tom Davis** – Former U.S. Congressman (R-Va.) who publicly opposed the name change, expressing concerns about historical revisionism and financial implications.

These individuals led public opposition through community forums, letters, petitions, and public meetings.

Additional notable figures in the anti-name-change movement include:

5. **Hugh Stuart** – A direct descendant of J.E.B. Stuart who actively opposed the renaming, publicly defending the legacy of his ancestor.

6. **Lisa Prosser** – A Stuart High alumna who vocally opposed the change, arguing that the name represented historical heritage rather than racism.

7. **Paul Clarke** – A prominent local voice associated with the "Concerned Citizens of Fairfax," actively opposing the renaming in public forums and local media.

These individuals were among the core group opposing the name change, participating in meetings, writing letters, and organizing local efforts.

The student-led movement to rename J.E.B. Stuart High School was initiated and primarily led by five seniors:

1. **Anna Rowan**
2. **Lidia Amanuel**
3. **Cassie Marcotty**
4. **Abby Conde**
5. **Marley Finley**

These students launched the campaign in 2015 by raising awareness through videos, petitions, community outreach, and public advocacy. Their leadership catalyzed broader support from alumni, community leaders, and national figures.
