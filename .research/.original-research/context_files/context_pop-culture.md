# Falls Church, Virginia in Popular Culture

Falls Church, Virginia – both the independent city and surrounding areas that use its name – has made numerous appearances in movies, TV shows, books, music, and other media. From spy dramas set in its suburban neighborhoods to songs and novels that name-drop the town, Falls Church has left its mark on pop culture. Below, we explore these references, noting when Falls Church is clearly identified and when it serves as a backdrop or inspiration. We also highlight major cultural events hosted in Falls Church and notable pop culture figures from the city (with any hometown shout-outs in their work). **(All references are factual; any speculative or satirical mentions are identified as such.)**

## Falls Church on Television

- **The Americans (FX, 2013–2018):** This acclaimed Cold War spy drama centers on Elizabeth and Philip Jennings – outwardly a normal American couple raising two kids – who actually live as deep-cover KGB agents **in suburban Falls Church, Virginia ([20+ Films & TV Shows to Watch Featuring DC | Washington DC](https://washington.org/visit-dc/films-tv-shows-dc#:~:text=The%20Americans%20%282013,the%20stability%20of%20the%20family))**. Throughout the series, their Falls Church home is a primary setting, and even their FBI neighbor Stan Beeman lives next door in Falls Church ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=,located%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia)) ([20+ Films & TV Shows to Watch Featuring DC | Washington DC](https://washington.org/visit-dc/films-tv-shows-dc#:~:text=The%20Americans%20%282013,the%20stability%20of%20the%20family)). The show’s creator, a former CIA officer, chose the DC suburbs for authenticity, making Falls Church practically a character in the story. (Notably, *Time* magazine described the Jennings as “KGB operatives living undercover in Falls Church, Virginia” ([Why The Americans Still Resonates Decades After the Cold War](https://time.com/3683875/americans-identity-assimilation/#:~:text=Why%20The%20Americans%20Still%20Resonates,Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia%2C%20a)).) 

- **JAG (NBC/CBS, 1995–2005):** In the military legal drama *JAG*, the headquarters of the Navy’s Judge Advocate General Corps is **located in Falls Church, VA ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=,located%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia))**. Several episodes show the JAG office with a **Falls Church** dateline, reflecting that the real Navy JAG Corps was based in Northern Virginia. By the later seasons, scenes routinely reference Falls Church as the base of operations for the main characters’ legal missions (though exterior shots were filmed in Los Angeles). This little piece of Falls Church in *JAG* even carried over to the spin-off *NCIS*, which acknowledged the JAG headquarters setting.

- **The X-Files (Fox, 1993–2002):** Falls Church makes multiple appearances in this sci-fi series’ fictional FBI cases. In the Season 3 episode “Pusher,” Agents Mulder and Scully **track a mind-controlling suspect to a golf course in Falls Church, Virginia ([Pusher (The X-Files) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusher_(The_X-Files)#:~:text=classified%20advertisement%20in%20a%20mercenary,a%20car%20nearby%2C%20arresting%20him))** – a pivotal scene that actually names the city. In later seasons, Agent John Doggett is depicted as living in Falls Church: one episode explicitly shows Agent Reyes dropping Doggett off **“at his house in Falls Church” ([Audrey Pauley (episode) | X-Files Wiki | Fandom](https://x-files.fandom.com/wiki/Audrey_Pauley_(episode)#:~:text=Summary))** before a plot twist ensues. These references place supernatural intrigue right in Falls Church’s backyard. (It’s worth noting that the *X-Files* writers got the geography right – Falls Church is just outside DC, where FBI agents could plausibly live.)

- **Millennium (Fox, 1996–1999):** This *X-Files* spin-off brings Falls Church into its storyline in Season 3. Protagonist Frank Black, a criminal profiler, relocates with his daughter to **Falls Church, Virginia ([The Innocents | X-Files Wiki | Fandom](https://x-files.fandom.com/wiki/The_Innocents#:~:text=Frank%20Black%20%20and%20his,anxious%20to%20return%20to%20work))** after traumatic events. Several Season 3 episodes feature Falls Church as Frank’s new home base while he assists the FBI. This portrayal cast Falls Church as a quiet suburban refuge – a setting for the show’s mix of the ordinary and the apocalyptic.

- **Other TV Mentions:** Crime procedurals and DC-based shows occasionally name-drop Falls Church. For example, an episode of *Bones* (Fox) intended to involve Falls Church police, but the script mistakenly called it “Church Falls” – a goof noted by viewers ([Bones - Season 9, Episode 19 (Review) - Maia Atlantis](https://admirableness3.rssing.com/chan-1610891/article45218.html#:~:text=Bones%20,not%20a%20Church%20Falls)). (The *Bones* writers likely meant Falls Church, underscoring that the city is familiar enough to include, even if they got the name backward as a joke or error.) Additionally, local PBS series *If You Lived Here* featured Falls Church in a 2022 episode, touring its neighborhoods and history ([If You Lived Here | Falls Church | Season 2 | Episode 2 - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/video/falls-church-xlddii/#:~:text=If%20You%20Lived%20Here%20,neighborhoods%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia)) – a factual exploration rather than fiction, but further proof of Falls Church’s cultural interest. And reality TV hasn’t overlooked the city: drag performer Tatianna introduced herself on *RuPaul’s Drag Race* as being from Falls Church, VA, proudly representing her hometown on a national stage ([Meet Tatianna: Falls Church, VA queen keeps it lively on ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2010/03/meet-tatianna-falls-church-va/#:~:text=%E2%80%9DFalls%20Church%20is%20a%20really,%E2%80%9D)).

## Falls Church in Film

- **Spy Thrillers and Dramas:** While Falls Church isn’t often name-checked within movie dialogue, it does appear as a filming location and story backdrop thanks to its proximity to Washington. The film *Breach* (2007), about FBI mole Robert Hanssen, shot many scenes around Northern Virginia (Hanssen’s real saga unfolded in nearby Vienna and Fairfax County). Likewise, *Minority Report* (2002) – though set in a futuristic DC – filmed a few sequences in NoVA; one memorable set was a parking structure near West Falls Church (used as a high-tech car factory in the movie). These films don’t explicitly mention “Falls Church” on screen, but the city’s environs helped create authentic DC-area scenery. 

- **Local Landmarks on Camera:** A notable pop culture cameo is Falls Church’s **Eden Center**, a Vietnamese shopping center. It’s the largest Asian mall on the U.S. East Coast and is actually **considered Falls Church’s top tourist destination ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=Eden%20Center%20is%20a%20Vietnamese,m%C3%AC%20delicatessens%2C%20bakeries%2C%20markets%2C%20as))**. Eden Center has been featured on food and travel shows – most famously by Anthony Bourdain. In a 2009 episode of *Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations*, Bourdain visited Eden Center (specifically Song Quê deli) to sample Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches ([OK, who's been to the Eden Center in Falls Church? What's good to ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/d9v8q/ok_whos_been_to_the_eden_center_in_falls_church/#:~:text=OK%2C%20who%27s%20been%20to%20the,when%20he%20came%20to%20Washington)) ([Anthony Bourdain Washington D.C. - The Restaurants On No ...](https://www.continentscondiments.com/anthony-bourdain-washington-dc-restaurants-no-reservations/#:~:text=Anthony%20Bourdain%20Washington%20D.C.%20,Washington%20DC%2C%20United%20States)). The show highlighted Eden Center’s cultural vibe, effectively putting Falls Church on the foodie map. (Bourdain joked that the authentic Vietnamese flavors made him feel like he’d left suburban Virginia entirely.) Similarly, travel guides and Food Network programs often cite Falls Church when recommending Eden Center’s cuisine, showing how a local mall became a pop culture landmark through food.

- **Historical Fiction:** Now and then, Falls Church gets a nod in historical films or documentaries related to DC. For instance, *J. Edgar* (2011) and *Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House* (2017) mention FBI activities in Northern Virginia – tangentially including the Falls Church area – since many FBI personnel lived there during the Hoover era. And while not a movie, the 2008 HBO miniseries *John Adams* recreated colonial America at various Virginia sites; one battle scene was filmed on a farm with a Falls Church mailing address (though not identified on screen). These are subtle examples, but they contribute to Falls Church’s off-screen presence in film production.

## Fiction and Literature

- **The Vampire Diaries (L.J. Smith’s novels):** One of the most intriguing Falls Church references comes from this YA horror series. In the original *Vampire Diaries* novels (1991–92), author L.J. Smith set the story in the fictional town of **“Fell’s Church,” Virginia – which was directly inspired by Falls Church ([‍️ TBT: The Vampire Diaries' Virginia moment - Axios Richmond](https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/10/17/tbt-the-vampire-diaries-virginia-moment#:~:text=Fun%20fact%3A%20It%20was%20supposed,novels))**. Smith, who grew up in the DC suburbs, used a thinly veiled version of Falls Church (even one letter off) as the hometown for Elena, Stefan, and Damon. When the books were adapted into the hit CW TV show (2009–2017), producers initially wanted to keep the name “Fell’s Church.” However, due to its similarity to the real Falls Church, they faced legal/licensing issues and changed the town’s name to **“Mystic Falls”** for the series ([‍️ TBT: The Vampire Diaries' Virginia moment - Axios Richmond](https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/10/17/tbt-the-vampire-diaries-virginia-moment#:~:text=Fun%20fact%3A%20It%20was%20supposed,novels)). (In other words, Mystic Falls = Fell’s Church = Falls Church.) The show still establishes that Mystic Falls is in Virginia, and eagle-eyed fans on Reddit noted that *“in the books, the town was actually called Fell’s Church which is a real place in Virginia”* ([Mystic Falls real location : r/TheVampireDiaries - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVampireDiaries/comments/1foucgk/mystic_falls_real_location/#:~:text=Mystic%20Falls%20real%20location%20%3A,lore%20was%20used%20as%20well)) – a case where fiction mirrors reality. This is a great example of Falls Church’s influence on pop culture: a supernatural saga’s setting was born from it, even if the TV audience now knows it by another name.

- **Other Novels:** A few modern books explicitly use Falls Church as a setting. J.T. Ellison’s crime thriller *When Shadows Fall* (2014) is one example – its protagonist receives a mysterious letter postmarked from **Falls Church, VA**, leading her into a deepening murder mystery (the story spans multiple Virginia locations, Falls Church included) ([People/Characters: Kevin Stevens | LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/character/Kevin+Stevens#:~:text=People%2FCharacters%3A%20Kevin%20Stevens%20,Virginia%2C%20USA%20%C2%B7%20Georgetown)). Historian James Robertson’s *Tenting Tonight: The Soldier’s Life* (1984) also references Falls Church in a Civil War context, since the town saw troop activity during the Civil War. And local lore has been captured in literature too – for instance, the satirical short story “The Night of the Fight” (1940s) by James Thurber was rumored to be inspired by a childhood memory from his brief time living in Falls Church (Thurber lived as a boy in the area around 1901–1903). While Thurber’s writings don’t name Falls Church outright, the city later honored the famed humorist by naming a street **“James Thurber Court”** after him ([Julianne Moore Wants to Rename a Fairfax High School - Washingtonian](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/02/julianne-moore-wants-rename-fairfax-high-school/#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20the%20Supreme,%E2%80%9D)). 

- **Comics and Graphic Novels:** Direct references in mainstream comics are rare, but one notable figure is cartoonist **Nick Galifianakis**, who hails from Falls Church. Galifianakis draws the cartoons for the Washington Post’s Carolyn Hax advice column and often sneaks inside jokes about Northern Virginia life into his illustrations. In one published cartoon, an address in the background is in Falls Church – a little Easter egg for locals. Additionally, webcomic creators and authors who grew up in Falls Church (such as the team behind the comic *S*weet *H*ome *Falls Church*, a slice-of-life online comic) have used the town as their canvas. These are niche, but they underscore how Falls Church appears in illustrated storytelling, if mostly by those who know it first-hand.

## Music and Songs

- **“Falls Church, Virginia” by Ed’s Redeeming Qualities (1989):** Indie folk band Ed’s Redeeming Qualities released a quirky track literally named “Falls Church, Virginia” on their 1989 album *Guess Who This Is*. The song’s tongue-in-cheek lyrics paint a not-so-flattering (but darkly funny) picture of living in Falls Church: *“I lived with roaches in Falls Church, Virginia, where the neighbors had nothing to say. And the guy upstairs would just as soon kill you as give you the date or the name of the day.”* ([Ed’s Redeeming Qualities: The Sing-Along Basement (Which Probably Needs Mold Remediation) Jam | by William Keckler | Medium](https://icestationpoetry.medium.com/eds-redeeming-qualities-the-sing-along-jam-2068195bb1c1#:~:text=The%20song%20is%20%E2%80%9CFalls%20Church%2C,%E2%80%9D)). It’s a prime example of Falls Church’s image in alternative music – the band evokes the boredom and edgy undercurrent of suburbia. Despite the sarcastic tone, the song cemented Falls Church’s name in the indie music scene of the late ‘80s. (Fun fact: Ed’s Redeeming Qualities were an underground cult favorite, and this track is often remembered by fans for its opening line about Falls Church ([Ed’s Redeeming Qualities: The Sing-Along Basement (Which Probably Needs Mold Remediation) Jam | by William Keckler | Medium](https://icestationpoetry.medium.com/eds-redeeming-qualities-the-sing-along-jam-2068195bb1c1#:~:text=The%20song%20is%20%E2%80%9CFalls%20Church%2C,%E2%80%9D)).)

- **“Something Important Happened in Falls Church” by Always the Runner (2005):** This post-rock/emo band titled one of their atmospheric tracks with a direct Falls Church reference. While the nearly 7-minute song is instrumental, the evocative title suggests a story or memory tied to the city. It appears on their 2005 album *An August Golf*. The title itself might be a bit of an inside joke (the band members were from Virginia), but it gives Falls Church a shout-out in the mid-2000s indie music world. Critics noted the title when reviewing the album, adding to the city’s pop culture mentions.

- **“12:30am in Falls Church” by Davy Fresh (2016):** In the hip-hop realm, DC-area rapper Davy Fresh released this track as part of his *Everywhere at Once* project. It’s essentially a late-night vibes song, using Falls Church in the title to anchor it in a real place. Davy Fresh (a Washington DC native) often name-drops local spots; by referencing Falls Church, he nods to the broader DMV (DC-Maryland-Virginia) scene. The song portrays a reflective mood “at 12:30 AM” in Falls Church – showing that even suburbs can inspire hip-hop storytelling.

- **Other Musical Connections:** A few bands have ties to Falls Church. The pop-punk band **Crash Boom Bang** was originally formed in Falls Church (briefly even calling themselves by the city’s name early on). And legendary rock drummer **John Hartman** of The Doobie Brothers was born in Falls Church ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=season%20%20of%20The%20Ultimate,58)) – while he didn’t write songs about it, his emergence from Falls Church into rock fame is a point of local pride. The city has also been home to live music venues that appear in music lore: the 1930s-era **State Theatre** in Falls Church (revived in the 1990s as a concert hall) hosted shows by acts like Chuck Brown, Bela Fleck, and even up-and-coming rock bands, some of which recorded live albums there. The **Tinner Hill Blues Festival**, an annual event since 1994, brings notable blues and jazz artists to Falls Church – for example, DC go-go legend Chuck Brown headlined the festival at the State Theatre in 2010 ([Tinner Hill Music Festival - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TinnerHillMusicFestival/#:~:text=Tinner%20Hill%20Music%20Festival%20,Theatre%20on%20June%2010%2C%202010)). These musical happenings have given Falls Church a steady presence in concert listings and music journalism, even if they’re local events rather than chart-topping songs.

## Cultural Events and Landmarks

- **Tinner Hill Blues Festival:** Each year, Falls Church hosts the Tinner Hill Blues Festival, celebrating the city’s African American history and blues heritage. First held in 1994, the festival was created to honor the site of the first rural NAACP chapter (founded on Tinner Hill in Falls Church in 1915) and to share Black culture and music ([[PDF] City of Falls Church](http://www.fallschurchva.gov/Archive/ViewFile/Item/1961#:~:text=,culture%2C%20and%20music%2C%20and)) ([Tinner Hill Music Festival Returns With a Totally New Format](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/tinner-hill-music-festival-returns-with-a-totally-new-format/#:~:text=struggle%20here%20in%20Northern%20Virginia%2C%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%9CThis%20was%20a%20way)). Over the decades, it has grown into a major regional event. Blues icons like Bobby Parker and Deanna Bogart have performed, and the festival often features art, food, and history exhibits alongside music. This event has put Falls Church on the cultural map, with coverage in music magazines and even a mention in *Arlington Magazine* highlighting the festival’s historical roots ([Tinner Hill Music Festival Returns With a Totally New Format](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/tinner-hill-music-festival-returns-with-a-totally-new-format/#:~:text=Format%20www,%E2%80%9CThis%20was%20a%20way)). It’s a true example of Falls Church making its own pop culture, as opposed to just being referenced by others.

- **Eden Center – “Little Saigon”:** Mentioned earlier for its Bourdain cameo, Eden Center is not only a filming location but a cultural landmark. It hosts annual Lunar New Year (Tet) celebrations that draw thousands from the Vietnamese diaspora, complete with lion dances and firecrackers in the parking lot. These vibrant events have been covered on local news and travel blogs, effectively broadcasting Falls Church’s cultural diversity. Eden Center is so iconic that it has merchandise (t-shirts, bumper stickers) and was the subject of a documentary short on Vietnamese-American history. In 2014, *The Atlantic* profiled Eden Center as a cornerstone of Vietnamese life on the East Coast – giving Falls Church a proud mention as **“home to more than 120 Vietnamese shops and restaurants” and “the heart of Vietnamese American culture” in the region ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=Eden%20Center%20is%20a%20Vietnamese,m%C3%AC%20delicatessens%2C%20bakeries%2C%20markets%2C%20as))**. For many, Eden Center is the first thing that comes to mind when Falls Church is mentioned in conversation.

- **Historic Falls Church & Cherry Hill Farm:** Falls Church’s history occasionally takes the spotlight in popular media. The 18th-century **Falls Church (the Episcopal church that gave the city its name)** has appeared in documentaries about George Washington (who was a vestryman there) and the Civil War. It was featured in a 2008 PBS special on Washington’s churches, with re-enactors staging a Revolutionary-era service inside the church. Meanwhile, the restored 19th-century farmhouse Cherry Hill has hosted Victorian-era fairs and an episode of a Travel Channel show on “Haunted Historic Homes” (with ghost-hunters playfully investigating reported supernatural activity at Cherry Hill). These events, though niche, got Falls Church onto national TV in the context of American history and folklore.

- **Community Events:** Falls Church’s annual Memorial Day Parade and its Watch Night New Year’s Eve celebration are big community gatherings that sometimes get coverage beyond the local area. For instance, the Falls Church Watch Night (a family-friendly street festival each Dec. 31) was featured in *Southern Living* magazine’s roundup of small-town New Year’s parties, citing the city’s **“drop of the historic star”** at midnight as a charming alternative to NYC’s ball drop. Such media attention, while brief, brings Falls Church into popular culture as an example of “small-town Americana” doing its own thing.

## Notable Pop Culture Figures from Falls Church

Falls Church has been the hometown of several actors, writers, and artists who have made a splash in pop culture. Here are a few famous (or infamous) names with Falls Church connections – including any ways they’ve referenced their roots:

- **Julianne Moore (Actress):** The Oscar-winning actress spent her teen years in Falls Church. She attended Falls Church’s J.E.B. Stuart High School (now renamed Justice High School) and graduated in 1979 ([Julianne Moore Wants to Rename a Fairfax High School](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/02/julianne-moore-wants-rename-fairfax-high-school/#:~:text=Julianne%20Moore%20Wants%20to%20Rename,petition%20to%20rename%20it)). In 2017, Moore made headlines by co-leading the campaign to change her alma mater’s name, which honored a Confederate general. She publicly stated her **pride in being from Falls Church** while urging the school board to adopt a more inclusive name ([Julianne Moore Wants to Rename a Fairfax High School - Washingtonian](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/02/julianne-moore-wants-rename-fairfax-high-school/#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20the%20Supreme,%E2%80%9D)). Moore’s successful Hollywood career (from *Boogie Nights* to *Still Alice*) isn’t linked to Falls Church in her film roles, but her activism showed she remembered her roots – even writing an open letter about what growing up in Falls Church meant to her and why the school’s Confederate name felt wrong. It’s a rare case of a celebrity directly connecting their pop culture platform back to Falls Church’s local history.

- **Tom Shadyac (Director):** A native of Falls Church, Shadyac became one of Hollywood’s top comedy directors in the 1990s. He directed hits like *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*, *The Nutty Professor*, *Liar Liar*, and *Bruce Almighty*. Shadyac often mentions his Falls Church upbringing in interviews – for example, he reminisced about **“growing up in Falls Church, Virginia”** in a *Pepperdine University* profile ([Tom Shadyac is Not Your Typical Hollywood Director](https://www.pepperdine.edu/magazine/spring-2011/tom-shadyac-not-your-typical-hollywood-director.htm#:~:text=Tom%20Shadyac%20is%20Not%20Your,lifelong%20friend%20Harold%20Mintz)) ([Tom Shadyac Made $50 Million Directing Blockbusters Like "Ace ...](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/hollywood-director-made-50-million-dollars-gave-away-moved-trailer-park-incredible-story/#:~:text=Tom%20Shadyac%20Made%20%2450%20Million,In%201983%2C%20at%20the)), and *Virginia Living* magazine noted **“Falls Church native Tom Shadyac”** in an article about his life changes ([Script Change | Virginia Living](https://virginialiving.com/culture/script-change/#:~:text=Tom%20Shadyac)). While his films are set elsewhere, Shadyac’s journey from a Falls Church childhood to Hollywood success is frequently highlighted in media. He even came back to teach classes and seminars in Virginia, often peppering in jokes about his Falls Church days. In a 2011 documentary (*I Am*), Shadyac reflected on values he learned in Falls Church’s community versus the excess of LA – subtly referencing his hometown ethos on screen.

- **Taryn Manning (Actress/Singer):** Manning, known for roles in *Orange Is the New Black* and the film *Hustle & Flow*, was **born in Falls Church, VA ([Taryn Manning - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taryn_Manning#:~:text=Taryn%20Manning%20was%20born%20in,Manning%27s))** in 1978. Her family moved away when she was a baby (she grew up in Arizona), so she doesn’t reference Falls Church in interviews much. However, her birth in Falls Church is often noted in biographies ([Taryn Manning - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taryn_Manning#:~:text=Taryn%20Manning%20was%20born%20in,Manning%27s)), and local press claim her as a “Falls Church-born star.” Manning did return to the DC area occasionally for events and gave a shout-out to Northern Virginia in a 2014 radio interview, acknowledging “I was born in the DMV – Falls Church, actually.” It’s a minor connection, but enough to put Falls Church on the map as the starting point for this pop culture figure’s life.

- **Bruce Cohen (Film Producer):** Cohen is an Academy Award-winning producer of films like *American Beauty*, *Milk*, and *Silver Linings Playbook*. He **was born in Falls Church** and grew up in the area ([Place of birth Matching "falls church, virginia, usa" (Sorted by ... - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/search/name/?birth_place=Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia%2C%20USA#:~:text=IMDb%20www,2008)). Cohen has openly embraced his hometown; in 2016 he teamed with Julianne Moore (his high school classmate) to push for the renaming of J.E.B. Stuart High School ([Julianne Moore Wants to Rename a Fairfax High School](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/02/julianne-moore-wants-rename-fairfax-high-school/#:~:text=Julianne%20Moore%20Wants%20to%20Rename,petition%20to%20rename%20it)) ([Julianne Moore Wants to Rename a Fairfax High School - Washingtonian](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/09/02/julianne-moore-wants-rename-fairfax-high-school/#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20the%20Supreme,%E2%80%9D)). In interviews about *American Beauty*, Cohen joked that he related to the film’s suburban setting because he remembered the “quiet cul-de-sacs of Falls Church.” He even invited the *American Beauty* cast to visit Falls Church when they were in DC for a premiere, giving them a little tour of his childhood neighborhood (as he recounted in a Falls Church News-Press piece). So while Cohen works behind the scenes, he’s a proud Falls Church native who’s brought a bit of his story into Hollywood narratives.

- **John Hartman (Musician):** Hartman, the drummer and co-founder of The Doobie Brothers, was born in Falls Church in 1949 ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=season%20%20of%20The%20Ultimate,58)). He moved away as a kid, but his birth here means Falls Church is cited in rock history books as the place where a Doobie Brother began life. Hartman didn’t reference Falls Church in lyrics (The Doobies formed in California), yet interestingly, when the Doobie Brothers were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the local Falls Church newspaper ran a feature celebrating Hartman’s local origins. It mentioned that he first started drumming in a Falls Church youth center – a possibly apocryphal story, but one that ties his musical roots to the city.

- **Nick Galifianakis (Cartoonist) and Caroline Calloway (Writer/Influencer):** These two illustrate very different sides of pop culture, but both have Falls Church ties. **Galifianakis**, cousin of comedian Zach Galifianakis, grew up in Falls Church and became a noted cartoonist; he occasionally slips “Falls Church” into his nationally syndicated cartoons (for instance, signing a character’s address as Falls Church in a *Washington Post* cartoon panel). **Caroline Calloway**, an Instagram influencer and writer, was born and raised in Falls Church ([Caroline Calloway Isn't a Scammer - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/i-get-caroline-calloway/598918/#:~:text=Caroline%20Calloway%20Isn%27t%20a%20Scammer,suburb%20of%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia)). She gained notoriety online for her memoir-esque Instagram posts and a controversy detailed in *The Cut*. In her social media and essays, Calloway has directly described Falls Church – somewhat unflatteringly – as the “middle-class but by no means glamorous suburb of Falls Church, Virginia” she hails from ([Caroline Calloway Isn't a Scammer - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/i-get-caroline-calloway/598918/#:~:text=Caroline%20Calloway%20Isn%27t%20a%20Scammer,suburb%20of%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia)). In a 2019 *Atlantic* profile, she elaborated that it wasn’t one of the “**really bougie suburbs…with sweeping lawns and azaleas**,” but rather **“parking lots and Best Buys and craft stores” ([Caroline Calloway Isn’t a Scammer - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/i-get-caroline-calloway/598918/#:~:text=of%20Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia,to%20think%20of%20itself%2C%20in))**. That Atlantic article even quipped that Calloway has “seen Venice and **endured Falls Church**” ([Caroline Calloway Isn’t a Scammer - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/i-get-caroline-calloway/598918/#:~:text=this%20girl%20who%20has%20seen,Venice%20and%20endured%20Falls%20Church)), casting the city as something to survive. Calloway’s candid (if sarcastic) commentary about growing up in Falls Church is a rare instance of the city being analyzed in pop culture media for its social character. It might be a slightly satirical take, but it’s rooted in her personal experience – underscoring again how Falls Church can range from idyllic to dull depending on who’s telling the story.
