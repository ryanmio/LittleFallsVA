# Mosby's Rangers Raid Falls Church (October 18, 1864)

In the pre-dawn hours of October 18, 1864, Confederate partisans under Col. John S. Mosby carried out a surprise attack on Union-occupied Falls Church, Virginia. The raid targeted the village's small **Home Guard** – an unusual interracial militia of local Union loyalists – and nearby Union troops. In the fray, **Frank Brooks**, a formerly enslaved Black militiaman, was shot dead while sounding the alarm, and **Rev. John B. Read**, a prominent Unionist preacher, was abducted and later executed by the raiders {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}} {{< cite title="Falls Church Virginia Civil War History" >}}. Contemporary eyewitnesses, newspapers, and military dispatches vividly described the brutality of the incident, which left the Falls Church community terrorized.

## Falls Church's Home Guard and Mosby's Threats

By 1864, Falls Church – a Northern Virginia village just 6 miles from Washington, D.C. – had been under Union control for two years, yet it lay in the heart of "Mosby's Confederacy," where **Col. John Singleton Mosby's** guerrilla cavalry operated freely behind Union lines {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} {{< cite title="Falls Church Virginia Civil War History" >}}. To protect themselves, Falls Church residents formed a **Home Guard** composed of both white and Black volunteers – *"comprised of unenlisted men and boys…an equal number of blacks and whites"* – who were armed and stood watch for Confederate raiders {{< cite title="The Falls Church - Churchyards" >}}. This uncommon interracial militia included **Frank Brooks**, a Black man who had gained freedom when Union forces occupied the area, and **John B. Read**, a 50-year-old farmer and Baptist lay minister. Read (often called "Reverend" by locals) was a known abolitionist who, with his daughter Betsy, had secretly educated freedpeople in the community despite Virginia's laws against teaching Blacks to read and write {{< cite title="Falls Church Black History" >}} {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}. Their makeshift school for African Americans sometimes attracted up to 60 students – freed and enslaved – each week, and Read's efforts to "enlighten their minds" earned him deep respect among Unionists and the ire of secessionists {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}.

Mosby's Rangers had been harassing Union outposts around Falls Church throughout 1864, seeking horses and supplies and punishing local Union sympathizers. Tensions escalated in the fall. In early September, Mosby audaciously struck a Union camp in the area, and a few weeks later Union cavalry retaliated by capturing some of Mosby's personal gear (including his saber) in a raid that they then **boasted about in Falls Church** {{< cite title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}. This tit-for-tat may have provoked Mosby to plan a bold incursion into Falls Church itself. Union commander Major Henry Lazelle had already warned that Mosby's *"highly successful raiders were continually around us"* and that the local Union force was too small to stop them {{< cite title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}. On the night of October 17, 1864, Falls Church was indeed on high alert – yet Mosby's men would catch them off guard.

## The Midnight Raid and the Death of Frank Brooks

Just after midnight (early October 18), a detachment of about **75 of Mosby's Rangers** swept into Falls Church in a lightning strike {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. The attackers were led by **Captain Richard Montjoy** of Company D, one of Mosby's most trusted officers {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}. Using ruses and the cover of darkness, the Confederates achieved almost total surprise. According to one account, they **rode in disguised as Union troopers** – pretending to be the 8th Illinois Cavalry – which allowed them to approach without raising alarm {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}. Around 2 A.M. the guerrillas simultaneously hit multiple points in the village. They **halted at The Falls Church** (the historic Episcopal church then serving as a Union brigade hospital) and **broke into the barn of local farmer John Sines**, seizing five valuable horses {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. Another squad of Rangers overran a picket post at the junction of Leesburg (Alexandria) Pike and Lewinsville Road, capturing its startled sentries – one Union corporal and three men of the 16th New York Cavalry – along with their mounts {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}.

As the raiders galloped through the center of the sleeping village, members of the Home Guard sprang into action. **Frank Brooks**, the Black Home Guardsman, rushed to assist the beleaguered Union pickets and raise an alarm {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. Using a hunting horn or trumpet, Brooks sounded the warning call to alert the rest of the troops camped nearby {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} {{< cite title="Falls Church Black History" >}}. At almost the same moment, **John Read** is said to have grabbed a horn as well and blew a blast to signal the Union encampment of the 16th New York Infantry posted on the edge of town {{< cite title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}. This clamor robbed the Rangers of their element of surprise – but it also drew deadly attention to the Home Guard. As Brooks continued to alert his neighbors, Mosby's men **shot him down**. The official report noted that *"a negro named Frank Brooks, belonging to the citizens' home guard of the village, was shot dead while attempting to assist the picket in making a defense."* {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}} His quick warning likely saved lives by rousing the Union garrison, but it cost him his own. One Union eyewitness later honored Brooks as *"a faithful Christian patriot"* who died trying to defend Falls Church {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}.

With the alarm raised and Union soldiers awakening, Captain Montjoy's priority shifted to **escaping with prisoners and loot** before reinforcements could intervene. The Rangers began **retreating west** out of Falls Church along the Alexandria-Leesburg turnpike toward Vienna, driving along the **captured horses and several Union prisoners** {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. In the confusion, they also snatched up John B. Read, who had been at home (near today's 300 W. Broad Street) when the raid hit. As the guerrillas swept past Read's yard, they seized him at gunpoint. According to Rev. Read's family, the Confederates initially **claimed to be Union cavalry** to lure him closer, then took him captive once he approached {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}. Along with Read, the raiders also dragged away one of his Black neighbors (or employees), **Jacob Jackson**, who had either been helping sound the alarm or happened to be with Read during the chaos {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. Read – unarmed but technically a member of the Home Guard – was exactly the kind of civilian whom Mosby's men viewed as a dangerous collaborator. As they hauled him onto a horse, the Rangers likely recognized him: the **"abolitionist preacher"** of Falls Church, well known for his Unionist activities. Years later, a Confederate veteran described Montjoy's detachment matter-of-factly: *"Montjoy led a group of rangers that executed Reverend John Read… as a spy."* {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}} At this point, Read and Jackson were prisoners being carried off into the night, and their fate was grim.

## "Executed in Dense Pine Woods": Rev. Read's Killing

After quitting Falls Church, Capt. Montjoy's column pressed about 12–13 miles west, into the wooded countryside of Fairfax County. Near a railroad trestle at **Piney Branch**, not far from **Hunter's Mill**, they halted to deal with their high-value prisoner {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. Rather than attempt to keep Read in captivity, the partisan rangers opted for summary execution. In their view, Read was an active Union informant or "spy" who had directly caused them harm by alerting Federal troops {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}. Before dawn on October 18, in a secluded stand of pine trees by the railroad, the Rangers **shot John Read in the head at point-blank range**, killing him instantly {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. They also attempted to execute Jacob Jackson. A pistol was placed against Jackson's head and fired, and he collapsed beside Read. One of Mosby's men, eager to finish off the Black captive, wanted to shoot Jackson a second time, but another guerrilla snarled at him to stop – *"He's dead enough; you must be fond of shooting dead niggers!"* {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}} – delivering a cruel kick to Jackson's limp body. Believing both victims dead, the raiders hastily left the scene to evade pursuing Union forces.

Incredibly, **Jacob Jackson survived** this ordeal. The bullet had torn off one of his ears and creased his head, knocking him unconscious but not killing him {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. After the Rangers departed, Jackson regained consciousness in the dark woods. Dazed and bleeding, he stumbled back toward Falls Church. Around 7 o'clock that Tuesday morning, he arrived in the village and "reported himself to the Read family," delivering the horrific news of John Read's fate {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}. When word spread, Read's wife **Charlotte** and daughter **Betsy** were overcome with grief. Neighbors soon located Read's lifeless body in the pine thicket near the railroad bridge, exactly where Jackson said it would be {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}.

Recovering Rev. Read's remains proved difficult. Initially, neither the Union soldiers in Falls Church nor the local Home Guard members dared venture out to Hunter's Mill, **fearing Mosby's men might still be lurking** {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. Ultimately, **Betsy Read and her aunt** (John's sister-in-law) harnessed a one-horse wagon and went themselves. They retrieved John Read's body and brought him home to Falls Church later that day, a scene his friend J.R.J. (a missionary to freedmen) described with sorrow: *"A sister of Mr. Read and his daughter, in a one-horse wagon, brought the body of this faithful Christian patriot to the desolate home which he had tried to defend."* {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}} An Army surgeon examined the corpse and confirmed what Jackson had reported: Read had been **executed at close range**, shot in the back of the head. *"There is no doubt concerning the murder of Mr. Reed,"* Major John Birdsall of the 13th New York Cavalry reported, *"the surgeon, who has made an examination of the body, states the skull at the base of the brain is blown to atoms, and the flesh about the wound is filled with powder, as if the pistol had been placed close to the head."* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} The killing had been deliberate. (Notably, some early news reports erroneously claimed the guerrillas *"cut his throat from ear to ear"* – a sensational detail the Washington **Evening Star** printed in its outrage {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} – but the surgeon's autopsy refuted that rumor, showing the cause of death was a gunshot.)

According to later local lore, **Col. Mosby himself sent a note to Mrs. Read** offering his condolences and guaranteeing her safe passage to retrieve her husband's body. Mosby had not been present at the raid – it was carried out by Montjoy acting under his general orders – and perhaps Mosby wished to show some chivalry after the fact. (Mosby had a reputation for **sparing civilians** when convenient, even as he dealt ruthlessly with armed enemies. One anecdote holds that Montjoy, who was a Freemason, invoked the Masonic brotherhood to **pardon a Union officer** slated for execution in a later incident – an act that *"Mosby was not happy about"* {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}.) In any case, the **cold-blooded murder of John Read** sent a chilling message to Union loyalists in Falls Church. As one Northern abolitionist put it, Read's earnest work on behalf of freedpeople had *"marked him for the hatred of the misguided wretches who rob and murder in the interest of slavery."* {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}} Indeed, the execution in the pines silenced one of the area's most outspoken anti-slavery voices.

## Union and Confederate Reactions

The Falls Church raid – especially Rev. Read's abduction and murder – generated shock and fury in the Union camp. **Newspapers** in Washington and beyond condemned the guerrillas' actions in blistering terms. The Washington **Evening Star** branded the killing an act of *"Rebel Diabolism"*, reporting that Mosby's gang had committed *"some of the most devilish deeds of cold blooded murder ever recorded"* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. (The Star article, titled *"Murders in Cold Blood by Mosby's Gang,"* emphasized the horror of a minister being slain, which the paper described – inaccurately – as having his throat cut, to stoke outrage.) The **Daily Ohio Statesman** in Columbus similarly decried the growing audacity of Mosby's guerrillas, noting *"these outrages so near to Washington are beginning to be regarded as a serious disgrace."* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} Union officials shared this anger. In an official dispatch on October 19, Major Birdsall flatly called Read's death a **"murder"** and forwarded evidence of the execution-style killing {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign" >}}. Birdsall also relayed intelligence from the surviving Jackson that Montjoy's men had met up with additional Confederate reserves near Vienna (possibly to fend off any pursuit) {{< cite title="Official Record - Shenandoah Valley Campaign II" >}}. The Union military command, embarrassed that Mosby could strike within a few miles of the capital, redoubled efforts to hunt down the guerrillas. (In fact, Captain Montjoy would be killed in a skirmish just a month later, in late November 1864 {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}. Mosby himself was seriously wounded in December, effectively curtailing his 1864 operations {{< cite title="CIA FOIA - Mosby's Rangers Chronology" >}}.)

Confederate accounts of the raid were more muted but indicated that they considered it a justified act of war. To Mosby's partisans, **John Read was a traitor and spy** who had gotten what he deserved. The guerrillas claimed Read had been aiding the Union army – carrying messages or giving information – under the guise of a civilian, which in their eyes warranted summary execution {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}. One Confederate memoirist later noted without apology that Read *"was executed…as a spy"* after the raid {{< cite title="Civil War Talk - Captain Montjoy" >}}. It's also clear that Mosby's men were enraged that **their surprise attack had been foiled** by local alarm-setters. The fact that a *Black* man (Frank Brooks) had helped thwart them likely added to their venom. (The racist remark made by one ranger when Jackson was shot – "dead enough…you must be fond of shooting dead niggers" – drips with the contempt they held for armed African Americans {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}}.) From the Confederate perspective, the Falls Church raid was a tactical success: they captured horses and prisoners and struck fear into Union locals. But even some Confederates found the **murder of a non-combatant preacher** a troubling act. Mosby, who carefully cultivated an image as a **gentleman guerrilla**, avoided directly trumpeting Read's execution in his own reports. Still, he defended the aggressive posture of his rangers. Mosby once remarked that *"being a terror to my enemies is an honor,"* reflecting his belief that intimidating Union sympathizers was a legitimate strategy. The raid on Falls Church certainly achieved that terror effect.

Notably, the **execution of Rev. Read came amid a brutal season of guerrilla warfare** in northern Virginia. Just weeks earlier, Union General George Armstrong Custer had ordered the hanging of several captured Mosby men in the Shenandoah Valley, and in November Mosby retaliated by executing an equal number of Union prisoners by lot {{< cite title="CIA FOIA - Mosby's Rangers Chronology" >}}. Such tit-for-tat violence was characteristic of the escalating **partisan conflict**. In that context, the killing of an alleged Union spy like Read – however heinous it seemed to northerners – fit the guerrillas' pattern of **reprisal and deterrence**. Mosby's Rangers wanted to send a message that Unionist activism in their territory could be fatal. As harsh as it was, that message was received in Falls Church.

## Aftermath and Legacy in Falls Church

The October 18 raid had immediate and long-term effects on the Falls Church community. In the short term, it **shattered the sense of security** in what had been a quiet garrison town. Civilians now truly lived "in fear," as one historical marker aptly titles the episode. **Betsy Read**, John's 18-year-old daughter, was so traumatized by her father's murder that she abandoned their brave educational venture. Just five days after the raid, Betsy wrote to family friend Emily Howland, *"My Dear Father has been shot yes cruelly murderd by the Rebels… As to the school I had concluded to take, I do not now feel as though I wanted to have anything to do with it."* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} She feared any continued schooling of African Americans would invite further rebel raids: *"I do not think it would be advisable at this present time for any one to commence a school that is a colored school… the Rebs are looking down on us and I should not be surprised if they should come down here again tonight."* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} Consequently, the **first school for Black residents in Falls Church** – which John Read and Betsy had fought so hard to establish – was closed indefinitely. It was a poignant setback for the community's African Americans, many of whom had only recently been emancipated. (Before the war, 250 people were enslaved in the Falls Church area; by 1870, Black residents made up 42% of the village's population {{< cite title="Falls Church Black History" >}}. Read's school had been a beacon of hope for them.) The raid thus succeeded in its likely intent to cow local Unionists: the village's pro-Union civilians kept a lower profile thereafter, focusing on survival until the war's end.

Frank Brooks's death also resonated as a martyrdom. Although Brooks did not live to see freedom secured, his role was remembered as an act of valor by a Black citizen-soldier. In an era when Black men in uniform were still a rarity in the Union army (the official U.S. Colored Troops were segregated units), the Falls Church Home Guard's **integration of Black and white** fighters was highly unusual {{< cite title="The Falls Church - Churchyards" >}}. Brooks's sacrifice demonstrated the commitment of Falls Church's Black community to the Union cause. Today, historians note that he was *"a Black member of the highly unusual interracial Falls Church Home Guard,"* and he is honored in local histories as one of Falls Church's first African American heroes {{< cite title="Falls Church Virginia Civil War History" >}}.

John B. Read's funeral was a somber affair. He was **laid to rest in The Falls Church Episcopal churchyard**, as the Baptist congregation he helped found had no cemetery of its own. He was buried next to his wife Charlotte and one of his daughters. His simple gravestone can still be seen today, inscribed *"John D. Read, 1814–1864"* {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}} (the stone uses the year 1812 for his birth, a slight error, as he was born in February 1814). The community would remember "Parson Read" as both a religious leader and a Union patriot. In December 1864, abolitionist teacher Emily Howland published a **tribute** to him in the National Anti-Slavery Standard, praising Read's dedication to uplifting the Black race: *"He was much interested in the improvement and elevation of the colored people, which marked him for the hatred of the misguided wretches who rob and murder in the interest of slavery."* {{< cite title="The Soldiers' Journal - December 1864" >}} Such words ensured that Read's death would not be merely seen as a senseless tragedy, but as a martyrdom for the cause of freedom.

Over time, the October 1864 raid entered Falls Church's folklore. It was said that for **many years after the Civil War, local children had a jump-rope rhyme** that recalled the violent suppression of their schools and church during Mosby's incursion: *"Isn't any school, / Isn't any teacher; / Isn't any church, / **Mosby shot the preacher**."* The sing-song rhyme grimly encapsulated how the raid had snuffed out education ("no school, no teacher") and even silenced the church ("no preacher") in Falls Church for a time. Such folklore kept the memory of the event alive as the town healed and rebuilt. In the Reconstruction era, Falls Church's Unionist citizens – including some former Union soldiers who settled there – reorganized their community. By 1875, the village had recovered enough to incorporate as an independent town {{< cite title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}. Yet the names of **Frank Brooks** and **John Read** remained known to those who cared to remember the heavy price the village paid in wartime.

In the modern era, the raid of October 18, 1864 and its victims are formally commemorated. In 2014, during the Civil War's sesquicentennial, the city of Falls Church installed a Civil War Trails historical marker titled **"Living in Fear"** near the site of Read's home on West Broad Street {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. It describes Mosby's raid on the village and the plight of the civilians. Another marker, **"Terror by the Tracks,"** stands along today's Washington & Old Dominion bike trail (the former railroad bed) at the approximate location of Read's execution {{< cite title="John D. Read - Wikipedia" >}}. There, visitors can read the story of Rev. Read, the **"lay preacher...shot execution style"**, and learn about Frank Brooks and Jacob Jackson's roles in the raid. The Falls Church Episcopal cemetery, where Read is buried, also contains a wayside sign noting his grave and summarizing his life as an *"anti-slavery activist"* and Home Guard member who was *"kidnapped [and] shot execution style"* by Mosby's men {{< cite title="The Falls Church - Churchyards" >}}. Through these memorials, as well as scholarly works and local archives, the full detail of Mosby's Falls Church raid has been reconstructed and preserved.

What emerges is a comprehensive picture of a **small but significant Civil War episode**: a pre-dawn raid that pitted irregular Confederate cavalry against a vulnerable civilian militia, an event that highlights the war's reach into communities and the stark risks taken by Unionists (both Black and white) in Confederate territory. The death of Frank Brooks underlines the courage of African Americans who defended their freedom, while the murder of John Read illustrates the extreme perils faced by Southern Unionists and abolitionists. In sum, the **Falls Church raid of October 1864** stands as a testament to the ferocity of partisan warfare and its lasting impact on a community – an impact still remembered and honored in Falls Church to this day.
