# **Chapter 1: "The Crying Trees"**

When I was small, my mother taught me how to listen to the trees, how to hear their whispers when their leaves moved like gentle fingertips brushing across a river's surface. The woods around our village were thick and full of secrets: rich earth underfoot, sweet-smelling cedar sap that clung to my hands, the flutter of birds whose names my grandmother patiently taught me—little flickers of red and gold that danced between the branches.

We lived by the waters the settlers call the Potomac, though we called it something else, a name that rolled softly from our tongues and honored its strength. Each spring, the river brought life, swelling with fish that shimmered in silver flashes beneath the sun. Our canoes moved gracefully over its surface, silent and careful, nets ready to catch its bounty. When night fell, my people sat around fires, their faces painted gold by flame, elders' voices weaving stories from the night air itself—stories of spirits that guarded our forests, of ancestors who lived in every shadow cast by moonlight.

I was twelve years old the first time I heard the trees cry.

It began one quiet morning as I knelt beside the river with my mother, fingers twisting quickly through strands of river grass. The sound was faint at first, distant, like thunder from a storm not yet arrived.

My mother stopped working, her hand hovering in midair. She tilted her head, listening. "Do you hear it, Keme?" she asked softly.

I held my breath. The sound returned, rhythmic, cold—a harsh, steady crack that traveled through the forest. "What is it?"

My mother stared toward the noise, her eyes narrowed. "It is the settlers. Their axes are biting into the trees."

Her voice carried a sadness I'd never heard before. I pressed closer to her. "Why do they cut so many?"

"They believe land belongs to them," she replied, looking down at her hands, tangled in green threads. "They think they can own the earth."

I watched as she continued weaving, but the rhythm was now off, her fingers moving slower, troubled. We finished quietly and made our way back to the village. But that sound stayed with me—a deep, lingering unease beneath everything familiar.

Days passed, and the noise grew louder. It seemed as if the settlers' axes never rested, each tree falling with a final, echoing crash. One morning, I woke before dawn and slipped away from our village, drawn toward the distant sound that now haunted my dreams.

Hidden among thick trees, I saw them clearly for the first time: men in strange clothes, faces flushed red with sweat and effort, swinging sharp, shining blades. They shouted words harsh and unknown, and laughed loud, jagged laughter as the trees gave way and crashed to earth. At the center was a man whose voice rose louder than all the rest. The others called him "Wren," a name like a bird, though no bird I had ever heard made sounds so harsh.

I watched them for hours, unable to move, my heart pounding. One enormous oak—a tree older than any elder in my village—finally gave in. Its roots twisted helplessly upward from the earth, and as it fell, the air itself seemed to tremble. When the oak crashed to the ground, splintering, shuddering, I felt something inside myself shatter too.

My breath came fast and shallow, panic rising. Turning quickly, I ran home through trees that still stood tall but whose leaves now whispered fear. Bursting into our hut, I fell at my mother's feet, choking back sobs. "They took the great oak," I whispered, shaking. "They took it."

She knelt and wrapped her arms around me, her voice low and steady, hiding nothing from me now. "This is only the beginning, Keme," she murmured, eyes dark with sorrow. "Our lives will never be the same."

Outside, the distant axes continued their relentless work. From that day onward, every tree that fell cried out to me, a quiet, mournful song that filled the spaces the birds had abandoned.

## **Chapter 2: "Strangers in Our Woods"**

In the months that followed, we watched quietly as the strangers crept closer. Each morning I woke to fewer trees and more sky, the heavy scent of cedar now faint beneath the smell of burning wood and overturned earth. At night, their fires glowed orange through the darkness, mocking the gentle flicker of our own hearths.

We tried to live as before, but the old ways began to slip from our grasp like river water through cupped fingers. Hunting trails my father had walked since childhood were now blocked by fences, strange wooden walls marking lines we never drew. Our paths—once soft and yielding, shaped by generations of bare feet—grew wide and hard under the press of heavy wagon wheels.

One afternoon, hidden beneath tall grass, I watched the settlers again. This time they brought others—men and women bound with ropes, whose faces wore a heaviness deeper than sadness. Their skin glistened under the punishing sun, their hands scarred and roughened from work. They moved slowly, carrying heavy stones toward a place cleared of trees, eyes lowered, feet dragging, guided by men whose voices cracked sharply, like the whips they carried.

At the center stood Wren, the loud-voiced man who pointed and shouted commands. He never lifted a stone himself but strode among them, nodding with approval as walls began to rise from the earth. Those stones stacked higher each day, cold and solid, forming something unlike anything we'd ever built. A structure without softness, without life—just heavy rock, suffocating the land beneath it.

One evening, as the sun sank behind the treeline, my father returned from trading near the settlement. His face was drawn, eyes weary.

"They've taken the land near the Little Falls," he said quietly, not looking at us. "They say we must not go there anymore."

My mother's hands paused, mid-motion, as she prepared food. She stared at him, eyes hard and sharp as flint. "Who can forbid us from our own waters?"

My father sat heavily, exhaustion etched deep into his face. "They have guns and laws. They believe words on paper mean more than blood in the earth. We can fight neither."

My mother's voice rose, trembling slightly. "Then what is left for us?"

He met her gaze but offered no answer. We sat quietly, food forgotten, the sound of distant laughter drifting in through gaps in our walls.

Weeks passed, and the settlers' voices grew bolder. Sometimes they rode horses near our village, their eyes lingering on us, dark and curious. We learned to stay hidden, moving like shadows, teaching our youngest to remain silent, still, invisible.

One night, sleepless, I crept out toward the settlement. Approaching the heavy stone building, I saw its outline against the moonlit sky, half-finished yet imposing, stones gleaming pale under moonlight. Quiet sobbing drew me toward a cluster of small shelters behind it. Peering through gaps, I saw the bound people—some awake, eyes hollow, others asleep on bare earth, chained together.

One woman raised her head slowly, her gaze meeting mine through the darkness. In her eyes, I recognized my own fear reflected back at me, multiplied a thousand times. She did not speak, but her silence filled the air between us with sorrow heavier than stone.

I slipped away, heart racing, returning through the woods to our home. But that night, as sleep overtook me, I dreamt of chains and walls, and awoke gasping for breath, tears streaming silently down my face.

## **Chapter 3: "Blood in the Cornfield"**

As summer faded, our hunger grew sharper. The settlers' fields expanded, swallowing our hunting grounds. Game fled to distant places, beyond our reach. Fish grew scarce, frightened by their noise. Each day we awoke weaker, each night brought dreams of food—visions of corn ripening beneath a stolen sun.

Finally, desperate and hollow-bellied, I crept toward their fields beneath a cloud-veiled moon. The corn stood tall, leaves rustling softly in the wind, their whispering voices urging me forward.

I moved quickly, fingers clawing through damp earth, pulling ears free one by one. My breath quickened, heart pounding in rhythm with my fear. Just a few more, I thought desperately, gathering the corn into my arms.

A sudden shout split the night. "There! Thief!"

My stomach lurched. I spun, dropping ears of corn to scatter at my feet. Two settlers rushed toward me, lanterns swinging wildly, their faces twisted in fury.

I ran, corn stalks whipping my arms and face, their harsh cries echoing behind me. Panic surged, cold and blinding. A gunshot cracked sharply, pain erupting in my shoulder, white-hot agony tearing through me. My vision blurred, legs stumbling beneath me.

"Got him!" one shouted triumphantly, voice distorted by ringing in my ears.

I staggered onward, blood hot and sticky, coating my fingers. Another gunshot whistled past, striking dirt nearby, showering me in earth. I forced myself forward, weaving through trees that seemed suddenly unfamiliar, cruelly indifferent to my suffering.

Time lost meaning as I ran, footsteps finally fading behind me. When I collapsed beside the river, its cold water rushed softly against my skin, soothing and indifferent. My blood mingled with mud and leaves, darkness gathering around me.

Hands touched my face gently—my mother's voice urgent, frightened. "Keme… Keme."

I forced open heavy eyelids, seeing her face blurred by tears. Her fingers pressed tightly to my shoulder, attempting to hold in life itself. "They'll kill you," she whispered, voice choked with grief.

My father knelt beside us, face lined with pain and resolve. "We leave tonight. We must find safety."

My mother looked at him fiercely. "This is our home."

"Not anymore," he replied heavily, eyes full of sadness. "It belongs to them now."

Together, we rose shakily. My shoulder burned fiercely, pain radiating through me like fire. I glanced toward the distant settlement, lanterns glowing like eyes through darkness. My father lifted me, guiding us silently through trees whose branches now felt like fingers reaching, pulling us away from everything we had known.

As dawn broke gray and muted, we fled our land, leaving only silence behind—deep silence, broken only by my ragged breathing, by the drip of my blood onto the earth. My mother's hand trembled, gripping mine as we walked, each step taking us further from the only life we'd ever known.

## **Chapter 4: "Exile"**

Days bled into nights, and each step carried us further from home, deeper into lands we did not recognize. The ground beneath my feet no longer whispered the familiar songs of my childhood; instead, it spoke a language foreign and cold. My wounded shoulder throbbed with every breath, pain weaving itself into the very fabric of my being.

Our small group moved slowly, silently, through the wild places left untouched by settlers. My father scouted ahead, eyes wary, guiding us through forests whose trees seemed indifferent to our presence. At night, huddled around a small, cautious fire, my mother tended my wound with hands gentle yet firm, her face tight with worry.

One evening, beneath a starless sky, she knelt beside me, softly singing an old song, its words heavy with sorrow. "Tell me again," I whispered, closing my eyes, "of our village, by the river."

Her fingers paused briefly against my skin. When she spoke, her voice was distant, hushed like wind through dying leaves. "Our village stood near waters that sang softly. Elders spoke to spirits in the trees, and the land provided everything we needed. There, your father taught you to hunt, to listen, to live."

"But it's gone," I murmured, bitterness rising in my throat.

She drew me close, arms steady. "Not if we carry it here," she said, placing a hand over my heart. "We must never forget, Keme."

My father returned, eyes tired but steady. "There are others, northward. People like us, driven from their homes."

We walked until my feet numbed and hunger hollowed me again. When finally we reached Conoy Island, I saw scattered fires burning—tiny lights flickering defiantly in the darkness, small signs of life and survival. But there was no comfort in the sight, only a deeper ache for what had been lost.

We were welcomed quietly by those who knew our grief firsthand. Each face bore stories of violence and displacement. At night, they spoke softly of lands left behind, of settlers whose greed devoured everything it touched. Yet beneath their sorrow was a quiet strength, born not of hope, but of stubborn survival.

My wound healed slowly, leaving behind a scar that pulsed with memories. I spent my days quietly observing, learning to weave and fish again in strange waters. But every task felt empty, every action distant, as if I lived on borrowed land, borrowed time.

I began spending evenings alone, sitting quietly at the water's edge, watching darkness swallow the horizon. I tried to find familiar stars above me, but they had shifted, hiding behind clouds I could not name.

One night, my father found me by the water, standing silently at my side. "I fear I've failed you," he whispered. "I could not protect our home."

I met his gaze, eyes burning with tears I refused to let fall. "They stole it from us. You did not fail."

He placed his hand gently on my shoulder, his touch filled with quiet strength. "Then we will survive," he whispered. "It is the only thing left to do."

But survival felt thin, hollow—little more than existing in shadows of a world that no longer recognized us.

## **Chapter 5: "Echoes Across Water"**

Years slipped quietly by, like the river beside us—steady, silent, unchanging. I grew taller, stronger in body, but the ache inside remained constant, unchanged by the passage of time. My mother's hair turned gray, my father's eyes grew weary, and I learned to carry grief without speaking its name.

Each evening, elders spoke softly around fires, recounting lost villages, stolen lands, and kin whose faces were fading memories. The younger children listened silently, eyes wide, learning from our sorrow. Our survival was one of quiet endurance, not triumph.

Sometimes I would wake from dreams, my body trembling, the echo of gunfire still ringing through my bones. Other nights brought gentler visions—river grass between my fingers, the scent of cedar sap heavy in the air, the voices of ancestors whispering comfort. I carried these dreams close, precious fragments of what settlers had ripped from us.

Then one autumn evening, an elder named Nokomis sat beside me, her wrinkled face illuminated softly by firelight. She watched me carefully, her eyes sharp despite age.

"You carry many ghosts," she said softly, voice steady as river stone.

I lowered my gaze. "I cannot let them go."

She touched my scar gently, fingers tracing the roughened skin. "Do not let them go," she whispered, "but do not let them drown you, either."

"How?" I asked bitterly. "Everything was taken."

She shook her head slowly. "Not everything, Keme. Memory is powerful. Our stories are seeds; they must be planted in new earth."

For weeks her words echoed through my mind, troubling yet compelling. I found myself remembering not only pain, but also laughter around warm fires, whispers of the trees, and the river's gentle embrace. Slowly, I began to speak openly—first quietly to the youngest children, then boldly to those gathered around evening fires. I shared memories of elders, of our lost village, of land that knew us by name.

One evening, as my voice faded into silence, a child approached cautiously. "Can we ever return home?" she whispered.

I knelt beside her, meeting her eyes. "Perhaps not. But we can carry home within us. Keep it alive."

She smiled, eyes clear and determined, nodding once before running back to her family. I watched her go, a strange warmth filling my chest.

That night, under clear skies filled with stars I now knew well, I stood alone by the river. My reflection shimmered, blurred slightly by ripples, as memories danced around me. For a moment, I closed my eyes, breathing deeply, letting sorrow and strength flow through me, inseparable.

In the distance, water whispered softly against rocks. And faintly, like an echo across impossible distance, I heard the river of my childhood, singing quietly beneath trees that stood tall and proud, whispering the names of those who came before us.

I opened my eyes slowly, gazing upward at stars—new stars that held our stories now, watching quietly above a land not our own, but patiently listening.
