I want your help going through each of my research files and adding the key facts to the front matter so that we can easily pull in which sources to use for relevant research. We should go through each and select the 1-10 most concrete facts presented in the research and add to frontmatter. We should make sure the facts are relevant to our resarch theme: Falls Church history. @editorial-series-plan.md 

For example this file:
@fairfax-county-official-vote-18881109.md we should add the Falls Church vote totals and what the vote was for, concisely
