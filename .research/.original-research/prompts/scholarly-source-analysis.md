# Scholarly Source Analysis Prompt

Analyze the provided scholarly source to extract evidence for the 1699 Falls Church claim using this systematic approach:

1. **Initial Review**
   - Identify main thesis, geographic focus, time period, and methodological approach
   - Look for explicit discussions of: settlement patterns, building materials, dating methods, architectural features, or archaeological contexts

2. **Factor Identification**
   - Determine which factor(s) the source provides evidence for:
     - **R**: Earliest settlement date in the region
     - **S**: Settlement vs. structure distinction
     - **D**: Brick vs. wood chimneys prevalence
     - **V**: Date inscriptions/cartouches frequency
     - **A**: Artifact chronology from the site

3. **Evidence Classification**
   - Classify evidence as quantitative (explicit counts) or qualitative (descriptive)
   - For quantitative evidence: identify counting units, inclusion criteria, and raw numbers
   - For qualitative evidence: note key descriptive terms (rare, common, etc.) with exact page references

4. **Extract and Document**
   - Create separate evidence files for each factor the source addresses
   - Follow template structure precisely
   - Include direct quotes with verified page numbers
   - Document all assumptions transparently
   - Set conservative hyperpriors based on evidence quality

5. **Verify and Cross-Reference**
   - Check citation accuracy and page numbers
   - Compare with existing evidence files
   - Note any contradictions or reinforcing patterns
   - Document limitations of applying this evidence to Falls Church

Never guess page numbers or citationsâ€”verify all references directly from the source text and request human verification when uncertain.
