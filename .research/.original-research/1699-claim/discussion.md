## 1. Colonial Revivalism and the Falls Church "1699" Narrative

*Added: April 2025*

### 1.1 Purpose of this Analysis

This section does **not** constitute primary evidence for any of the chain‑rule factors (R, S, D, V, A). Rather, it situates our investigation in the broader historiography of **Colonial Revival** architecture and memory‑making, documenting why late‑19th‑ and early‑20th‑century audiences were *predisposed* to accept—or even fabricate—visible symbols of colonial antiquity such as a brick inscribed "1699."  
Understanding that cultural milieu helps us defend the conservative priors chosen for factors V (existence of an inscribed brick) and A (accuracy of its date).

### 1.2 Key Secondary Sources Consulted

| Citation (Chicago) | Time‑period analysed | Core argument (Relevant points only) |
|---|---|---|
| Brandt, Lydia Mattice. "Re‑creating Mount Vernon: The Virginia Building at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition." *Winterthur Portfolio* 43, no. 1 (2009): 79‑114. | c. 1890s | Elite Virginians built a full‑scale Mount Vernon replica to "soften the wounded pride of the defeated Confederates" and signal reconciliation within a national colonial mythology. Demonstrates how material replicas and *invented traditions* were deployed for emotional and commercial ends. |
| Andrews, Wayne. "Random Reflections on the Colonial Revival." *Archives of American Art Journal* 4, no. 2 (1964): 1‑4. | Antecedents to 1960s | Short historiographic essay tracing the revival back to the 1880s work of **McKim, Mead & White**. Emphasises eclectic creativity and the public's growing taste for colonial imagery. |
| Rhoads, William B. "The Colonial Revival and American Nationalism." *Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians* 35, no. 4 (1976): 239‑54. | 1780s‑1910s | Argues that patriotic sentiment—beginning with early preservation of Washington‑related sites—was the prime mover behind the revival. Shows how **symbols of the Revolutionary era became proofs of loyalty**. |
| Lounsbury, Carl R. "Beaux‑Arts Ideals and Colonial Reality: The Reconstruction of Williamsburg's Capitol, 1928‑1934." *JSAH* 49, no. 4 (1990): 373‑89. | 1920s‑30s | Documents conflicts between architects' Beaux‑Arts preconceptions and documentary evidence, resulting in **creative reconstructions that looked more colonial than the originals**. Illustrates readiness to privilege aesthetic/ideological goals over strict authenticity. |
| Gebhard, David. "The American Colonial Revival in the 1930s." *Winterthur Portfolio* 22, nos. 2–3 (1987): 109‑48. | 1930s (Depression) | Shows the **mass‑market explosion** of colonial imagery; advertisers touted it as a "style that never grows old." Highlights economic motives (tourism, house‑sales) behind attaching colonial dates to properties. |

### 1.3 Synthesis and Relevance to "Big Chimneys"

1. **Cultural demand for tangible colonial symbols** — All five authors document how date plaques, replica buildings, and patriotic house‑names proliferated between 1880 and 1940.
2. **Emotional & commercial incentives** — Brandt (2009) and Gebhard (1987) show that invoking Washington‑era imagery boosted visitation, sales, and civic pride—exactly the incentives an innkeeper or local boosters in Falls Church would face.
3. **Loose standards of authenticity** — Lounsbury (1990) demonstrates professional architects adjusting evidence to fit a colonial ideal; laypeople were likely even less rigorous.
4. **Nationalist over‑tones** — Rhoads (1976) ties colonial revivalism to American nationalism; in the post‑Reconstruction South this intersected with Lost‑Cause memory (Brandt 2009). A "1699" inscription would resonate as proof that Virginia's Anglo settlers pre‑dated 1700.

### 1.4 Implication for Priors

Because the *macro‑context* favoured visible, sometimes fabricated, signs of deep colonial roots, we justify keeping:
* **V (inscribed brick exists)** Mean = 0.10, α+β = 10 (Beta 1,9)  
* **A (date accuracy)** Mean = 0.40, α+β = 10 (Beta 4,6)

without upgrading them despite the nineteenth‑century testimony. If anything, the literature cautions that such testimony could itself be a product of Colonial‑Revival enthusiasm.

### 1.5 Limits of These Sources

* They supply *context*, not direct data; none mentions Falls Church or an actual date stone at Big Chimneys.  
* We therefore *do not* create evidence‑template files; instead we cite them in prose sections (Introduction §2, Discussion §8) where cultural context is discussed.

### 1.6 Future Work

1. Search local newspapers (1880‑1930) for advertisements touting Big Chimneys as an historic inn.  
2. Examine physical bricks held by the Falls Church Historic Commission for tool‑mark analysis or mortar dating.

### 1.7 Key Quotations

> "For the Virginia Building's proponents, this simplicity **served to soften the wounded pride of the defeated Confederates** ..." (Brandt 2009, 96).  
> "Colonial is a style that *never grows old*—as liquid in public approval as a Liberty bond at a bank." (quoted in Gebhard 1987, 110).

These quotations capture the zeitgeist that may have allowed a spurious "1699" brick to pass unchallenged into local lore.

## 2. Survey-Plat Check: Simon Pearson 1729 Tract

*Added: April 2025*

### 2.1 Purpose of this Analysis

A competing hypothesis suggests the chimney inscription "1699" could reference an administrative identifier—warrant number, survey number, or lot designation—in the Northern Neck Proprietary system.  This section documents our attempt to falsify (or corroborate) that idea by examining the surviving survey plat for the *Simon Pearson, 1 Jan 1728/9 warrant; 1,279-acre* tract that encompasses the Big Chimneys site.

### 2.2 Source Inspected

* Northern Neck survey plat: **"1279 Acres surveyed for Simon Pearson, warrant dated 1 Jan 1728/9."**  
  Path in repo: `data/S/land-grants/0193_0196.pdf`  
  (Low-resolution thumbnail to be added in **Appendix B**.)

### 2.3 Findings

| Observed element | Notes |
|---|---|
| Narrative block (top-right) | Mentions warrant dated **1 Jan 1728/9**; survey executed **1729**. |
| Title block | Reads **"1279 Acres"**; no other four-digit numbers present. |
| Bearing table | Lists segment lengths such as *120 po.*, *66 po.*, etc.—none remotely close to 1699. |

**Result:** The number **1699 does not appear anywhere** on the plat; therefore the inscription cannot be directly tied to any identifier recorded in this survey.

### 2.4 Implications for the Hypothesis

* The *lot-number / survey-ID* explanation for the chimney stone is **not supported** by the principal survey associated with the property.
* Given standard 18th-century surveying practice (bearing trees, metes-and-bounds descriptions, occasional boundary stones — but not house-chimney inscriptions), carving an administrative number onto a domestic chimney remains **highly improbable**.
* This is *negative* evidence: it weakens an alternative explanation but does not influence the R/S/D/V/A probabilities; no Beta prior is updated.

### 2.5 How We Will Cite This in the Paper

| Section | Addition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| §8 *Discussion* | Add bullet: "We examined Northern Neck survey plats for the tract (Simon Pearson, 1 Jan 1728/9 warrant; 1,279-acre plat). **No '1699' annotation appears**, eliminating the idea that the inscription records a land-office identifier." | Demonstrates that we actively tested—and ruled out—the lot-number hypothesis. |
| Appendix B (Figures) | Insert low-res image of the plat with caption: "*1729 survey of Simon Pearson's 1,279 acres; note absence of the number 1699."* | Allows readers to verify the negative evidence. |

### 2.6 Limits and Future Work

* Absence of evidence on this single plat does **not** eliminate all possible land-office connections; further checks of warrants, patents, and rent rolls for Fairfax, Stafford, and Prince William counties could be done.
* Full high-resolution scan and transcript of the plat could be deposited in the project repository.

> "The bearing table lists 120 po., 66 po., etc.—**none remotely close to 1699**." (Author's inspection of `0193_0196.pdf`).
