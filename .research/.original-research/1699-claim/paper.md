abstract: "Local tradition asserts that Falls Church, Virginia was first settled in 1699 with construction of the log dwelling later called *Big Chimneys*. No contemporary documentary record corroborates the date, yet it appears on signage, tourist material, and municipal branding. We propose a transparent, fully probabilistic framework that (i) decomposes the claim into a chain of conditional propositions, (ii) assigns coherent prior probability distributions to each, and (iii) propagates uncertainty via Monte‑Carlo simulation. The approach yields posterior credible intervals rather than single‑point estimates and highlights which assumptions dominate inference. All data, code, and priors are openly released, establishing a reproducible baseline for future evidence updates."

## 1 Introduction

Built heritage dates can harden into civic "facts" despite thin evidence. Because official plaques and highway signs shape public memory, rigorous validation matters. Here we scrutinise the **1699** settlement claim for Falls Church.

### 1.1 Why a Conditional Bayesian Approach? 
When evidence is sparse, historians sometimes default to an implicit "50/50 until proven otherwise." That posture is *itself* a claim—a hidden prior of 0.5 that ignores two critical realities:

1. **Absence of evidence is itself evidence.**\
   If a 1699 settlement existed, we would expect traces: tax entries, church tithables, archaeological layers, or at minimum references in neighbouring records. Their non‑appearance shifts probability downward; our model must capture that.
2. **Causal dependence matters.**\
   The claim cannot be true unless *every* link in a causal chain holds: the region was occupied → a permanent dwelling was erected → it featured a brick chimney → that chimney carried an inscription → the inscription dates construction. While some might object that a 1699 settlement could exist without an inscribed brick, the claim of 17th-century European settlement entered historical record solely because of this alleged inscription — without it, this claim could not have become local lore.

A **conditional Bayesian decomposition** handles both issues:

- It lets us assign evidence‑weighted priors to *each* link, making the *lack* of corroboration lower those priors rather than sit silently.
- It keeps the chain explicit, so archaeologists know that confirming an inscribed brick (\(V\)) would shift the posterior far more than, say, refining regional habitability (\(R\)).

### 1.2 Goals of This Paper

1. Formalise that causal chain.
2. Quantify uncertainty with defensible probability distributions.
3. Identify where additional research most reduces uncertainty.
4. Provide a reproducible workflow historians can reuse.

### 1.3 Scope and Logical Preconditions

The present analysis **consciously restricts itself to the evidentiary pathway that could plausibly have generated the public belief in a 1699 foundation date.**  This choice is grounded in three principles of probabilistic reasoning:

1. **Observation‑selection effect.**  The *only* reason 1699 is remembered is an alleged *1699* brick observed in the nineteenth century.  A cabin built in 1699 **without** such a marker would not have singled out that year; the fact that we discuss 1699 at all is conditional on that observation.  Bayesian conditioning therefore demands we model the pathway that includes a brick, even if the brick was later lost or misinterpreted.
2. **Non‑zero uncertainty, never categorical zero.**  Setting any link's prior to exactly 0 would force the joint probability to 0 and preclude learning.  Instead, uncertainty about the brick's existence and accuracy is encoded in wide Beta priors for \(V\) and \(A\).  If future excavation conclusively falsifies the brick, we will *update* these priors toward zero rather than hard‑code them in advance.
3. **Research tractability and falsifiability.**  Framing the claim as a causal chain highlights which link is currently evidence‑poor (the brick) and thus testable by focused archaeology.  Competing scenarios with no inscription are implicitly included in the lower tail of \(V\) and \(A\)'s posterior distributions; they are *not* ignored, merely weighted by their plausibility given present knowledge.

**Implication.**  The model does *not* claim that a 1699 cabin without an inscription is impossible; it claims such a scenario is overwhelmingly unlikely *to have produced the extant tradition* that we are now evaluating.

## 2 Historical Background

Big Chimneys allegedly stood near today's 44 & Washington St. 19th‑century sketches show a one‑and‑a‑half‑storey log cabin with twin brick chimneys, one reputedly inscribed *1699*. Earliest secure mention: an 1803 Fairfax County deed. Colonial settlement in the Northern Neck proliferated after 1700 but sporadic occupations existed earlier. No extant tax, grant, or vestry record directly documents habitation at the site in 1699.

## 3 Analytical Framework

### 3.1 Chain‑Rule Decomposition We model the event as

$$
P(E)=P(R)\,P(S\mid R)\,P(D\mid R,S)\,P(V\mid R,S,D)\,P(A\mid R,S,D,V)
\tag{1}
$$

A concise product form (dropping explicit conditioning) is

$$
P(E)=R \times S \times D \times V \times A
$$

Here the five capital letters are **shorthand variable labels**, not initials of words; they map to the formally defined conditional terms listed below.

Variables (adapted from the project's earlier heuristic):

| Symbol | Conditional statement                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \(R\)  | Region habitable and likely occupied in \(1699\pm\delta\) (1669–1729).                  |
| \(S\)  | **A structure intended to be permanent (long‑lasting) was built during that interval.** |
| \(D\)  | Given such a structure, it had at least one brick chimney.                              |
| \(V\)  | Given a brick chimney, it bore an inscribed brick.                                      |
| \(A\)  | Given the inscription, "1699" accurately records the build year.                        |

### 3.2 Why Bayesian? 

*Point estimates* ignore their own error. By treating each factor as a **random variable** with a prior distribution we obtain:

- Credible intervals conveying epistemic uncertainty.
- Automatic updating when new evidence arrives.
- Posterior variance decomposition (e.g., first‑order Sobol indices) quantifies the leverage of each assumption on the overall uncertainty.

For tractability we assume the five priors are mutually independent; Appendix C shows a sensitivity run where \(S=0\) whenever \(R<0.1\). Results change < 0.002 in posterior mean.

### 3.3 Why a Conditional‑Causal Decomposition Is Essential

Classical historical arguments often default to a vague *"no evidence ⇒ 50∶50"* stance. That is epistemically weak because it treats all unknowns as symmetrical and glosses over the **specific causal steps** required for a claim to be true.  Our framework makes every link in the causal chain explicit:

1. **Necessity** – Each factor (R, S, D, V, A) is *jointly necessary* for the 1699 date to hold. If *any* link's probability is near zero, the overall plausibility collapses.
2. **Research tractability** – Breaking the claim into constituent events lets specialists tackle them independently: dendrochronologists on \(S\), brick archaeologists on \(V\), archivists on \(R\), and so on.
3. **Absence‑of‑evidence as evidence** – Bayesian priors can encode expectations about record survival. Sparse or missing documentation pushes the posterior down in a principled, quantified manner rather than a hand‑wavy discount.
4. **Transparent updating** – When, say, a charcoal sample dates a chimney brick, we update \(D\) and \(V\) *only*, leaving other priors untouched. The model's modularity prevents double‑counting evidence.
5. **Decision relevance** – City planners and sign‑makers need bounded risk. A single posterior credible interval (e.g., 0.04%–3.1%) is more actionable than a rhetorical "maybe."

In sum, the chain‑rule decomposition is not an arbitrary choice; it is **necessary** when evidentiary gaps are themselves informative and when each sub‑claim can, in principle, be corroborated or falsified through targeted investigation.

## 4 Data and Evidence

This section will systematically present the historical evidence collected for each factor in our causal chain. Each subsection will be populated as evidence is gathered over the coming months.

### 4.1 Evidence for Factor R
[DATA COLLECTION PENDING]
- Region habitable and likely occupied in 1699±δ (1669–1729)

### 4.2 Evidence for Factor S  
[DATA COLLECTION PENDING]
- A structure intended to be permanent (long-lasting) was built during that interval

### 4.3 Evidence for Factor D
[DATA COLLECTION PENDING]
- Given such a structure, it had at least one brick chimney

### 4.4 Evidence for Factor V
[DATA COLLECTION PENDING]
- Given a brick chimney, it bore an inscribed brick

### 4.5 Evidence for Factor A
[DATA COLLECTION PENDING]
- Given the inscription, "1699" accurately records the build year

Each factor's evidence will be systematically collected and analyzed with appropriate statistical methods to derive the Beta distribution parameters used in the model.

## 5 Prior Specification

We encode expert judgements as $\mathrm{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ distributions (mean = $\alpha/(\alpha+\beta)$):

| Factor | Mean  | 95 % interval | Beta parameters   |
| ------ | ----- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| \(R\)  | 0.70 | 0.40–0.90    | α = 7, β = 3     |
| \(S\)  | 0.60 | 0.30–0.85    | α = 6, β = 4     |
| \(D\)  | 0.25 | 0.05–0.55    | α = 2.5, β = 7.5 |
| \(V\)  | 0.10 | 0.01–0.30    | α = 1, β = 9     |
| \(A\)  | 0.40 | 0.15–0.70    | α = 4, β = 6     |

*Rationale:* \(R\) receives a stronger prior (α+β = 10) because environmental reconstructions are robust; \(V\) is highly uncertain, hence a diffuse prior. \(D\) has a lower mean (0.25) because brick chimneys were relatively rare in frontier structures of this era, with most early dwellings using wood, stone, or clay.[^1]

We treat the nineteenth-century testimony about the inscribed brick as a single Bernoulli success updating the $\text{Beta}(1,9)$ prior for $V$ to posterior $\text{Beta}(2,9)$.[^2]

[^1]: Cf. Spence 2019, 85‑89: brick chimneys < 30% in Chesapeake cabins pre‑1720; inscribed bricks < 3% of surviving examples (Tidewater Brick Survey 2021).

[^2]: This approach explicitly models the eyewitness testimony as data rather than embedding it implicitly in the prior.

### 7.2 Factor Importance 

Variance-based sensitivity analysis using first-order Sobol indices (via Saltelli sampler with 10,000 draws, seed 42) identifies \(V\) (inscribed brick existence) and \(D\) (brick chimney presence) as the top leverage points, contributing **37.7%** and **23.7%** of the posterior variance, respectively. This confirms our hypothesis that the physical evidence for the inscribed brick is the most critical uncertainty in the model.

The full contribution breakdown shows:
- \(V\) (Inscribed brick): **37.7%** (95% CI: 27.2%–48.4%)
- \(D\) (Brick chimney): **23.7%** (95% CI: 16.1%–31.9%)
- \(A\) (Date accuracy): **14.5%** (95% CI: 7.5%–22.2%)
- \(S\) (Structure built): **8.4%** (95% CI: 2.0%–15.8%)
- \(R\) (Region habitable): **7.0%** (95% CI: 1.0%–13.8%)

![Figure 2: Tornado plot of Sobol indices showing the contribution of each factor to uncertainty. The sum of all first-order indices (91.3%) being less than 100% indicates the presence of interaction effects between factors.](figures/sobol_indices.pdf){width=80%}

These results highlight that archaeological investigation targeting masonry evidence would provide the greatest reduction in uncertainty about the settlement date.

## 8 Discussion

1. **Dominant uncertainty:** Physical evidence for an inscribed brick (factor \(V\)) drives **37.7%** of posterior variance, with the chimney's existence (factor \(D\)) contributing another **23.7%**. Together, these material factors account for over **61.4%** of the model's uncertainty. Targeted masonry excavation offers the greatest potential payoff for resolving the historical question.

2. **Robustness:** Even optimistic priors (doubling \(V\) mean to 0.20) would still keep \(P(E)\) relatively low – still well below "About Even Odds". This robustness test confirms that the low posterior probability is not merely an artifact of our specific prior choices.

3. **Policy implication:** Current signage stating "Settled 1699" overstates certainty by two orders of magnitude. We recommend "Early 18th‑Century Settlement (c. 1700-1710)" pending further excavation. This more cautious claim is supported by the strong evidence for regional occupation after 1700 (factor \(R\) = 0.70) while acknowledging the uncertainty about the specific 1699 date.

4. **Methodological insight:** The high leverage of factors \(V\) and \(D\) demonstrates that archaeological evidence would most efficiently reduce uncertainty in this case. By contrast, archival research (primarily affecting factor \(R\)) would have limited impact, as it contributes only **7.0%** to the variance.

The posterior remains prior-dominated; incorporating future excavation data (e.g., radiocarbon, dendrochronology) will update \(D,V,A\) via the same likelihood mechanism demonstrated with the 19th-century testimonial evidence.

## 9 Conclusion

Our Bayesian chain-rule model converts scattered qualitative clues into a quantitative credibility range, finding the 1699 settlement claim to be highly improbable (posterior probability **0.8%**) though not impossible. The analysis identifies the purported inscribed brick as the dominant source of uncertainty, contributing **37.7%** of the posterior variance. 

Importantly, this approach provides policy-relevant guidance: the 1699 foundation date currently on municipal signage overstates certainty by approximately two orders of magnitude. Archaeological investigation focused on masonry evidence would provide the greatest uncertainty reduction.

This quantitative framework serves historical analysis in two ways: it enforces transparent reasoning about the impact of missing evidence, and it provides credible bounds on probability rather than vague rhetorical qualifiers. The methodology demonstrated here can be readily adapted to other historical sites where tradition outpaces documentary evidence.

## Appendix C – Logical Constraint Sensitivity Analysis

To test the impact of assuming independence among our priors, we implemented two logical constraints:

1. When $R < 0.1$ (region barely habitable), we force $S = 0$ (no structure built). This models the causal dependency between regional habitability and structure construction.

2. We impose $V = 0$ whenever $D = 0$ (an inscribed brick cannot exist without a chimney). This is directly implemented in our main model since it's a physical necessity, not merely a correlation.

The first constraint has minimal impact on the posterior mean (difference < 0.0002), while the second constraint is essential for physical consistency in the model. The Sobol indices account for these constraints, confirming the robustness of our sensitivity analysis.
