notes: |
  This article provides valuable qualitative evidence about chimney construction materials in the colonial Chesapeake region (including Virginia) through archaeological analysis.
  
  Key phrases from the source:
  - "Most colonial houses had wooden clapboards, shingles, and chimneys" (p. 449)
  - The Flowerdew Hundred Feature 35 dwelling (dated to "first half of the 18th century") had "bricked hearth" which was specifically noted as making it "above average in the context of the early-18th-century Chesapeake" (p. 454-455)
  
  The article establishes that brick chimneys were uncommon in colonial Chesapeake structures, with wooden chimneys being the norm. Even in the early 18th century (post-1700), a brick hearth was considered an "architectural flourish" marking a dwelling as "above average" compared to contemporaries.
  
  I've set a Beta(2,8) prior with mean=0.2, reflecting that brick chimneys were uncommon but not exceedingly rare. The 95% CI of [0.05, 0.40] captures the uncertainty while emphasizing the relative scarcity of brick chimneys.
  
  Transferability considerations:
  - The Chesapeake region described includes Virginia, making it directly relevant to Falls Church
  - The time period (late 17th/early 18th century) directly corresponds to the 1699 claim
  - The article specifically discusses frontier/colonial structures similar to what would have existed in Falls Church
  
  Limitations:
  - The article doesn't provide exact percentages of brick vs. wooden chimneys
  - Regional variations within Virginia might exist but aren't specified

### Summary

This evidence addresses Factor D (brick chimney presence) based on Alison Bell's archaeological analysis of colonial Chesapeake structures. The article provides clear qualitative evidence that wooden chimneys were standard in colonial structures of this region and time period, while brick chimneys were uncommon and considered an architectural upgrade.

Bell explicitly states that "Most colonial houses had wooden clapboards, shingles, and chimneys" (p. 449), establishing wooden chimneys as the norm. This is reinforced by her analysis of the Flowerdew Hundred Feature 35 dwelling, which dates to the "first half of the 18th century" (post-1700). The dwelling had a "bricked hearth" that, along with other features like plaster and wooden floors, marked it as "above average in the context of the early-18th-century Chesapeake" (p. 454-455).

The article notes that while wealthy planters could afford more substantial construction, they still often chose expedient wooden structures with wooden chimneys. When brick elements were used, they were notable enough to be specifically called out as distinguishing features of wealthier homes.

Given this evidence, a brick chimney on a frontier cabin near Falls Church in 1699 would be unlikely, as brick chimneys were relatively uncommon even for wealthier colonists in the early 18th century. This supports a conservative prior probability that would place brick chimneys in the "uncommon" category (estimated around 20%).
