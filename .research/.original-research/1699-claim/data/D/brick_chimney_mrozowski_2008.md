notes: |
  - **Site context.** Rich Neck Slave Quarter (44WB52), Williamsburg, Virginia, occupied ca. 1740–1770.
  - **Chimney evidence (p. 704).** "The dwelling site … consisted of the remains of a mortared brick, H‑shaped chimney foundation and associated hearth fill and builder's trench."
  - **House form (pp. 704–705).** "The dwelling was thus a wooden, two‑room house … with a central chimney and a dirt floor."
  - **Interpretation.** Demonstrates that even vernacular enslaved housing in mid‑18th‑century Tidewater could feature a *brick* chimney. This moderates earlier assumptions that brick chimneys were confined to elite homes.
  - **Transferability.** Although 40–70 years later than the 1699 window and within a plantation context, Falls Church lies in the broader Chesapeake region. We treat the finding as *one qualitative success* informing Factor D while retaining a conservative prior.
  - **Limitations.** Single site; later period; enslaved‑labor context; cannot directly infer prevalence in 1699 frontier Falls Church. Further quantitative surveys are needed.
