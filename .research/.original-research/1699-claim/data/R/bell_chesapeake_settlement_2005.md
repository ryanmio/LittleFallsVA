notes: |
  This article provides evidence about settlement patterns and agricultural development in the Chesapeake region (including Virginia) during the 17th and early 18th centuries.
  
  Key points relevant to Factor R:
  - English immigrants to the Chesapeake established various settlement patterns including "hamlets, single farmsteads, and nucleated villages" with villages typically containing "between 12 and 50 households" (p. 449)
  - By the late 17th century, planters "scattered widely to claim the maximum amount of land on which to grow tobacco" (p. 449)
  - The institution of separate farms "took hold early and firmly in the colonial Chesapeake" with settlements remaining "much more diffuse than in New England" (p. 449)
  - Agricultural practices shifted from communal to individualistic approaches throughout the 17th century
  - Wealthy planters like Robert "King" Carter were well-established by this period, indicating substantial regional development
  
  The evidence strongly supports that the Chesapeake region, including Virginia, was actively settled and developed by the late 17th century. The diffuse settlement pattern described would be consistent with frontier expansion into areas like Falls Church by 1699.
  
  I've set a Beta(7,3) prior with mean=0.7, reflecting the strong evidence for regional settlement and habitation by the 1699 timeframe. The 95% CI of [0.41, 0.91] captures the uncertainty while emphasizing the likelihood of regional occupation.
  
  Transferability considerations:
  - The Chesapeake region described includes Virginia, making it directly relevant to Falls Church
  - The time period (late 17th/early 18th century) directly corresponds to the 1699 claim
  - The article specifically discusses frontier expansion patterns consistent with the Falls Church area
  
  Limitations:
  - The article doesn't specifically mention Falls Church or areas immediately adjacent to it
  - There's no direct archaeological evidence presented for the specific Falls Church site
  - The focus is on broader regional settlement patterns rather than specific local settlements

### Summary

This evidence addresses Factor R (region habitable and likely occupied) based on Alison Bell's archaeological analysis of colonial Chesapeake settlement patterns. The article provides compelling evidence that the broader region including Virginia was actively settled during the late 17th century.

Bell describes how English immigrants to the Chesapeake established various settlement forms including "hamlets, single farmsteads, and nucleated villages" with villages typically containing "between 12 and 50 households" (p. 449). By the late 17th century, a significant transition had occurred in which planters "scattered widely to claim the maximum amount of land on which to grow tobacco" (p. 449), creating a dispersed settlement pattern.

The article emphasizes that the institution of separate farms "took hold early and firmly in the colonial Chesapeake" with settlements remaining "much more diffuse than in New England" (p. 449). This diffuse pattern of frontier expansion is consistent with the gradual occupation of areas further from the initial colonial centers, which would include the Falls Church area by 1699.

Bell also documents the shift from communal to individualistic agricultural practices throughout the 17th century, noting that farming became "primarily an economic activity driven by individual acquisitiveness" (p. 448). The presence of wealthy established planters like Robert "King" Carter indicates substantial development in the region by this time.

While the article doesn't directly mention Falls Church, the overall settlement patterns described provide strong support for the likelihood that the broader region was habitable and actively being settled by 1699, making occupation of the Falls Church area plausible during this timeframe.
