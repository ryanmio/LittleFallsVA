notes: |
  Gallivan (2011) synthesizes two decades of archaeological research on Late Woodland through early colonial Native societies in the Chesapeake. The review compiles data from dozens of excavations—Potomac Creek, Chickahominy River, James‑York Peninsula, Southside Virginia—that collectively document sustained, and in many places dense, indigenous occupation from c. AD 1100 through the 17th century. Key passages relevant to regional occupation include:

  * "South of the Potomac, most Late Woodland settlements in the Chesapeake were large, dispersed communities located near rivers…" (p. 297).
  * "The survey records the emergence of a Late Woodland landscape after AD 1100 comprising residential communities…" (p. 297).
  * "…borderlands between culturally distinct traditions from AD 1400 to the 17th century" (p. 300).
  * "By the early colonial era this region was home to rival Algonquian weroances, powerful Iroquoian traders, Siouan cultural influences…" (p. 300).

  These statements indicate that the Northern Virginia/Upper Potomac zone—including the Falls Church vicinity—was both ecologically viable and embedded within broader indigenous settlement systems in the decades immediately preceding 1699. While Gallivan also cites Rice (2009) on certain *localized* uninhabited tracts, the preponderance of evidence points to ongoing human presence across much of the region. Because the article is a secondary synthesis rather than primary excavation report, we adopt a conservative weight of 10 (α+β) but set a relatively high mean (0.70) reflecting widespread habitation probability.

  Limitations:
  - Focuses on Native societies, not European colonists; applicability to European habitable conditions inferred.
  - Does not pinpoint the exact Falls Church locale; spatial transferability assumed moderate.
  - Qualitative synthesis; no explicit settlement counts.

### Summary

Gallivan's review confirms sustained Late Woodland and early colonial Native occupation throughout the Chesapeake watershed, including the Potomac corridor near Falls Church. Archaeological evidence of palisaded villages, ossuary burials, and maize adoption demonstrate that the region was well‑inhabited and resource‑rich leading up to 1699. This supports a strong prior belief (Beta(7,3), mean ≈ 0.70) that the Falls Church area was habitable and likely occupied during 1669–1729.
