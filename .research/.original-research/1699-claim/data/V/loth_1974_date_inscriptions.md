  # QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE: Document prior selection logic
  
  **Key phrases used by author suggesting frequency:**
  - "In Virginia, glazed headers were used primarily to emphasize the checkered effect of Flemish bond; **only rarely were they used to form special designs such as diapering, herringbone, *dates* or initials." (Loth 1974, 91)
  
  **How language was translated to probability:**
  The phrase "only rarely" clearly indicates uncommon usage. The author specifically includes "dates" among these rare decorative features in Virginia brickwork. Following the qualitative translation guidance, "rare" corresponds to a probability in the 0.10-0.20 range. I conservatively use 0.10 (10%) as the mean.
  
  **Justification for alpha0/beta0 values:**
  Beta(2,18) provides a mean of 0.10 with weight = 20. The relatively higher weight (compared to minimum guidance of 10) is justified by the comprehensive nature of Loth's statewide survey, representing his expert assessment after examining numerous buildings across Virginia spanning three centuries.
  
  **Regional transferability considerations:**
  While Falls Church is in Northern Virginia, Loth's survey covers statewide patterns across the Tidewater, Piedmont, and Valley regions. The author presents this rarity of date inscriptions as a general Virginia characteristic, contrasting it with more elaborate decoration found in neighboring states like Maryland.
  
  **Limitations and future data needs:**
  - While comprehensive, this remains a qualitative assessment without explicit counts.
  - Focuses on surviving structures; potential survivorship bias.
  - Systematic survey specifically cataloging inscribed dates on period chimneys would strengthen this evidence.

### Summary

Calder Loth's authoritative statewide survey of Virginia brickwork (1974) provides significant evidence regarding the frequency of date inscriptions in colonial masonry. The author explicitly states that "only rarely were [glazed headers] used to form special designs such as diapering, herringbone, dates or initials" (p. 91, emphasis added).

Throughout this comprehensive review spanning three centuries of brickwork evolution, Loth highlights various decorative brick treatments and regional patterns, but consistently characterizes date inscriptions as an uncommon feature in Virginia's architectural landscape. While decorative patterning (including dates) was more common in neighboring areas like Maryland and New Jersey, such embellishments remained infrequent in Virginia.

The author's clear classification of date inscriptions as "rare" directly addresses Factor V in our model. While no explicit counts are provided, this expert assessment from a systematic survey of Virginia's historic architecture supports a low prior probability (approximately 10%) that any given brick chimney from the period would feature a date inscription. This is encoded as Beta(2,18), reflecting the low expected prevalence while assigning moderate weight (20) to this qualitative but comprehensive survey.

This evidence is particularly relevant to the "1699" date allegedly inscribed on a Big Chimneys brick, suggesting that such a feature—while possible—would have been statistically unusual for Virginia construction of that period. The relative rarity of such inscriptions increases the burden of documentation for claims based on purported date cartouches.
