  **Key phrases used by author suggesting frequency:**
  • "Practically the only method one can use to assign a general period to an individual brick is through identification of its process of manufacture … **Much more useful information for dating purposes is derived from a brick's context rather than from the brick itself.**" (p. 83)
  
  • Throughout the article, Loth correlates structural elements (bond patterns, water tables, chimney forms) with dated buildings, demonstrating that complete structures—not isolated bricks—provide reliable chronological evidence.
  
  **How language was translated to probability:**
  The statement that a brick's "context" provides "much more useful information for dating purposes" than the brick itself directly addresses the settlement-vs-structure distinction central to Factor S. This indicates a low probability (~30%) that isolated brick artifacts would be sufficient for dating a site, compared to complete structural remains.
  
  **Justification for alpha0/beta0 values:**
  Beta(3,7) provides a mean of 0.30 with weight = 10, reflecting the author's clear methodological emphasis on structural context rather than individual bricks, while maintaining moderate confidence appropriate for qualitative evidence.
  
  **Regional transferability considerations:**
  As a methodological principle for dating historic sites, this evidence applies across Virginia regardless of subregion. Falls Church would be subject to the same archaeological and architectural dating considerations as other Virginia sites.
  
  **Limitations and future data needs:**
  - Not explicitly focused on settlement archaeology, but on architectural analysis.
  - Applies primarily to masonry dating; may not address all settlement contexts.
  - Further methodological studies on artifact-vs-structure dating in early colonial contexts would strengthen this evidence.

### Summary

Calder Loth's comprehensive survey of Virginia brickwork provides significant methodological guidance relevant to Factor S (settlement-vs-structure distinction). On page 83, he explicitly states that "much more useful information for dating purposes is derived from a brick's context rather than from the brick itself," establishing a key principle for architectural chronology.

Throughout the article, Loth demonstrates how structural elements—bond patterns, chimney forms, water tables—provide chronological markers within their architectural context. His approach shows that isolated bricks rarely offer sufficient evidence for dating; rather, it is their arrangement and relationship within a complete structure that enables reliable chronological assessment.

This methodology directly addresses Factor S in the 1699 Falls Church claim, supporting the position that finding isolated brick artifacts is insufficient to establish settlement dates—complete structural remains and their features provide much stronger chronological evidence. The evidence is encoded as Beta(3,7), indicating a low probability (mean 0.30) that individual bricks would be sufficient for dating, with moderate confidence (weight = 10) based on this qualitative expert assessment.

This evidence helps establish that claims about settlement chronology must carefully distinguish between artifact recovery and documented structural remains. For the Falls Church claim, this reinforces the need for evidence of an intact structure from 1699, not merely brick artifacts potentially reused or moved from their original context.
