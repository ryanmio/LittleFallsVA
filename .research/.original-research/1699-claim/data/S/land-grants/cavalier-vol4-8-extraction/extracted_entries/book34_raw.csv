Examined
Listed
Personal Names: The user of this index
should be as imaginative in his pursuit of
a surname as a colonial clerk might have
been in his spelling. Virtually all variant
spellings of personal names in the
abstracts are unchanged in the index.
The indexer has not presumed to decide,
for example, whether Thomas Bailey is
the same person as Thomas Bayley. Nor
has see also been included since it would
be impossible to suggest all of the
possibilities. When the sub-entry Capt.
or other title is listed without a given
name, no given name appears in the
abstract (or in the patent book). The
underline ( ) is used in place of
given names or surnames if information
was missing or illegible in the patent.
Place-Names: Variant spellings of place
names and variant abbreviations of geographical terms have been retained in the
index. The user should remember that
colonial clerks were recording many
names for which there were no standard
English spellings. No attempt is made to
indicate the best or most frequent
spellings of place names used during the
colonial period.
Patentees: The given names of all
patentees appear in capital letters in the
index.
