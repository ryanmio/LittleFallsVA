AN EXPLANATION
This is the end of the Virginia Land Office Patent Books.
The next books in the Land Office Records are titled COMMONWEALTH GRANT
BOOKS and start with a new numbering sequence for the post-Revolutionary War
period and continue into the 20th Century. Although they are titled Commonwealth
Grant Books, the first 38 pages of Commonwealth Grant Book E contain Regal patents
issued between 1 May 1775 and 15 Mar 1776. These patents are abstracted on the
following pages."
