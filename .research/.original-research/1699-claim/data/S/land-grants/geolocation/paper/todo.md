todo:
- [ ] add examples of the grant entries
- [ ] Trim the abstract to 250 words
- [ ] Fix typos in figure & table numbering
- [ ] Remove the arrow “↩” line-break artifacts in prompts
- [ ] Fix broken hyphenation and odd glyphs. e.g. “metesand-bounds”, “LLMonly”, stray degree symbols. A single pass with \inputencoding{utf8} (LaTeX) or a search-and-replace script will solve it. 
- [ ] State data/code availability early. Add a one-sentence link in §3 or end of abstract: “Corpus, ground-truth and evaluation scripts are at https://github.com/…”.
- [ ] Add a “Dataset overview” box summarizing sample sizes (dev/test/ground-truth/GIS baseline) to resolve ambiguous n statements.
- [ ] Re-compute and harmonize all cost figures (e.g., GPT-4.1, GPT-4o) to two significant figures; ensure consistency across all tables and text.
- [ ] Break up long, footnoted sentences (e.g., in §4.1 about contractor costs); move anecdotes and detailed explanations to the appendix.
- [ ] Replace “±” in prose with “mean 23 km (95 % CI 18–30)” style; keep confidence intervals in tables only.
