REASONING STEP 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Finding intersection coordinates**  I need to find a precise coordinate
that represents the "beginning" of the tract or the approximate centroid.
The tract starts near Capt Damerfield's and goes down the south branch of
Crump's Creek to the mouth of Gentry's Branch. It seems I need the
intersection where Gentry's Branch meets the South Branch of Crump Creek.
I'll look for these streams on the map and approximate the coordinate to
around 37.7900N, -77.5900W.

REASONING STEP 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Investigating Crump Creek location**  I’m looking into the Crump Creek
location in Hanover County near Montpelier, around coordinates 37.780N,
-77.690. Montpelier itself sits at 37.82N, -77.67W, so I suspect Crump
Creek is on the south side. I remember Crump's Millpond, part of the
Diascund Creek network in New Kent, but that's more southeast. Genealogical
records suggest Crump's Creek is in Hanover, with references to early land
ownership. I'll estimate a coordinate of about 37.788N, -77.546W, but I
want to refine it further by researching offline.
