REASONING STEP 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Finding precise coordinates**  I'm trying to approximate a vantage point
near Colosse, in King William County, along VA 30, near the intersection
with Cohoke Road. It's better to focus on St. John's Church for coordinates
since it's a notable landmark. I remember that St. John's Church is located
at 5987 Old Indian Fields Rd., West Point, VA. I estimate the coordinates
as 37.6170°N, 76.9973°W. It's interesting because there are actually two
St. John's in Virginia, one in West Point and another in King William.

REASONING STEP 2:

**Refining coordinates for analysis**  I'm considering a vantage point near
Macon's line, specifically by Piscataway Creek, which is east of St. John's
Church. I’ll use the coordinates 37.6336° N, -76.9383° W but know we still
have to be cautious with approximations. I’m looking at a broader view of
King William County, including West Point. I want to provide precise
latitude and longitude for a larger area, especially along the Pamunkey
River and near key historical sites. I'm taking care to compute everything
accurately as I zero in on the ideal coordinates.

REASONING STEP 3:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Finalizing coordinates**  I'm working on producing the coordinates in the
correct format: 37°37'49.00000"N 076°59'26.00000"W. I need to ensure the
longitude shows three digits, so it looks like 076. Now, let’s convert
these decimal degrees. For latitude, 37.6303 yields roughly 37°37'49.080".
For longitude, -76.9906 converts to about 76°59'26.160". So my final
coordinates will appear as 37°37'49.08000"N 076°59'26.16000"W. I’m ready to
go ahead with this!
