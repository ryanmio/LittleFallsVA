**Exploring Holloway Swamp**

I'm looking into Holloway Swamp, which might be in Prince George County near Disputanta. I remember there being a Holloway Swamp along Route 156, and it connects with Blackwater Swamp in Prince George County near Newville. I want to ensure my mental mapping is accurate since Blackwater Swamp runs along the border of Prince George and Sussex counties. It seems that Holloway Swamp could be flowing south to north. Let’s analyze the names further!

**Locating Coordinates for Holloway Swamp**

I'm considering the farmland south of Holloway Swamp, looking for a precise location to approximate the area, which is about 400 acres near an intersection. I want to find accurate latitude and longitude, ideally at the confluence of Holloway and Blackwater Swamps. I’m estimating the coordinates around 37.004°N and 77.152°W based on nearby sites. I recall that the Blackwater Swamp crosses I-95 around 37.05°N and -77.37°W, which might help narrow it down further.
