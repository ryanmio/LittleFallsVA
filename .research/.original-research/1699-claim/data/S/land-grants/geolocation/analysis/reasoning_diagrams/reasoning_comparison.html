        <tr><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Step 1:</strong><p>**Exploring Holloway Swamp**<br><br>I'm looking into Holloway Swamp, which might be in Prince George County near Disputanta. I remember there being a Holloway Swamp along Route 156, and it connects with Blackwater Swamp in Prince George County near Newville. I want to ensure my mental mapping is accurate since Blackwater Swamp runs along the border of Prince George and Sussex counties. It seems that Holloway Swamp could be flowing south to north. Let’s analyze the names further!</p></div></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 1:</strong><p>**Locating Blackwater and Holloway Swamps**<br><br>I need to parse a land grant description from 1703 mentioning "the S side of the main Black Water Swamp" and locate the southwestern side of it. I know Blackwater Swamp is in southeastern Virginia, specifically in Prince George County, and flows into the Blackwater River. There's a part of it in Surry County too. I'm curious if Holloway Swamp is a small tributary and if it's in Prince George or Sussex County. I'll search for Holloway Swamp in Virginia to clarify.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Step 2:</strong><p>**Locating Coordinates for Holloway Swamp**<br><br>I'm considering the farmland south of Holloway Swamp, looking for a precise location to approximate the area, which is about 400 acres near an intersection. I want to find accurate latitude and longitude, ideally at the confluence of Holloway and Blackwater Swamps. I’m estimating the coordinates around 37.004°N and 77.152°W based on nearby sites. I recall that the Blackwater Swamp crosses I-95 around 37.05°N and -77.37°W, which might help narrow it down further.</p></div></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Holloway Swamp, Sussex County, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 36.9058167, 'lng': -77.2405153, 'formatted_address': 'Sussex County, VA, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Holloway Swamp, Sussex County, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 2:</strong><p>**Confirming swamp coordinates**<br><br>I've noted the coordinates for Holloway Swamp in Sussex County, which seem plausible. Next, I want to confirm the location of Blackwater Swamp's larger trunk. The description indicates it's on the south side of the main Black Water Swamp, near the meeting point of Holloway Swamp. So, I need to geocode the intersection where Holloway Swamp flows into Blackwater Swamp for further clarity. Let's move to that step!</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Blackwater Swamp, Sussex County, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.10810973086775, 'lng': -77.15139208254142, 'formatted_address': 'Blackwater Swamp, Virginia 23842, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Blackwater Swamp, Sussex County, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 3:</strong><p>**Determining intersection coordinates**<br><br>I'm looking at the coordinates 37.1081, -77.1514, which seem to place me in northeastern Sussex County near the Prince George border. I've noted Holloway Swamp's coordinates at 36.9058, -77.2405, about 0.2 degrees south and slightly west. It might be useful to calculate the centroid between these two points since the description mentions being near the branch of Holloway Swamp, specifically on the south side of Blackwater Swamp. This could help approximate the intersection at the mouth of Holloway Swamp.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Holloway Swamp and Blackwater Swamp confluence, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.4315734, 'lng': -78.6568942, 'formatted_address': 'Virginia, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Holloway Swamp and Blackwater Swamp confluence, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 4:</strong><p>ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d33fd3d881918cb853eac463ec0a06fbf8e75786ea0e', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Holloway Branch, Blackwater Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.1733, 'lng': -77.2396666, 'formatted_address': 'Blackwater Dr, Virginia 23842, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Holloway Branch, Blackwater Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 5:</strong><p>**Checking locations and features**<br><br>I found the coordinates 37.1733, -77.2397, which might be along Blackwater Dr, near Waverly and perhaps close to the center of Prince George. But then I noticed the coordinates for Holloway Swamp at 36.9058, which is located in southwestern Sussex, so there's a mismatch. It's possible there could be two features named Holloway Swamp. I think it's worth checking the alternate spelling "Halloway Swamp" to clarify this.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Halloway Swamp, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.4315734, 'lng': -78.6568942, 'formatted_address': 'Virginia, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Halloway Swamp, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 6:</strong><p>**Clarifying locations**<br><br>I’m trying to pin down Holloway Swamp's location at coordinates 36.9058 -77.2405, near the Virginia and North Carolina border, not far from the Blackwater River. I think it might actually be in Isle of Wight or Southampton counties. Alternatively, there's the Blackwater Swamp in Prince George County, which flows into a Blackwater River. There are two Blackwater Rivers in Virginia, but the southeastern one forms the border of Isle of Wight and Southampton County.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Holloway Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.1593052, 'lng': -77.2405153, 'formatted_address': 'Prince George County, VA, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Holloway Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 7:</strong><p>**Refining the search**<br><br>I’m considering searching for "Connells Mill pond blackwater swamp," but it might be better to narrow it down.

Targeting my search this way could help me get the specific information I need. It’s all about finding the right keywords, so let’s go with that!</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> geocode_place<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'query': 'Blackwater Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia', 'strategy': 'natural_feature'}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.1733, 'lng': -77.2396666, 'formatted_address': 'Blackwater Dr, Virginia 23842, USA', 'strategy': 'natural_feature', 'query_used': 'Blackwater Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia point, Virginia'}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 8:</strong><p>**Refining coordinates for Blackwater Swamp**<br><br>I’m analyzing the coordinates: lat 37.1593, long -77.2405. This puts me near Blackwater Swamp, which we previously had as 37.1081, -77.1514. The latitude difference of about 0.051 equals roughly 5.6 km north, while the longitude difference of about 0.089 translates to approximately 7.4 km west. I’m considering that if we mention the "south side of Blackwater Swamp," the Holloway coordinate might actually be north of it. Maybe we need to look closer to around 37.094? Let’s refine this further.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="tool-call"><strong>Tool:</strong> compute_centroid<br><strong>Args:</strong> <pre>{'points': [{'lat': 37.1733, 'lng': -77.2396666}, {'lat': 37.1593052, 'lng': -77.2405153}]}</pre><br><strong>Result:</strong> <pre>{'lat': 37.16630260075652, 'lng': -77.24009098928921}</pre></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 9:</strong><p>**Evaluating coordinates and centroid**<br><br>I found the coordinates 37.1733, -77.2397, which seem to relate to Prince George. It looks like Google is referencing a point near Blackwater Swamp, and this is quite close to Holloway Swamp's coordinates. They appear to overlap nicely. Considering multiple possible locations, I can compute a centroid between these two swamps, landing at approximately 37.1663, -77.2400. However, since the description specifies the south side of Blackwater Swamp, shifting slightly south might be the best approach.</p></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div class="reasoning-step"><strong>Reasoning 10:</strong><p>**Calculating the centroid**<br><br>I’ve identified two anchor points: Blackwater Swamp to the north and Holloway Swamp oriented north-south. The land sits on the south side of Blackwater, intersecting with Holloway, which is around latitude 37.165 and longitude -77.24. To find a representative location, I'll compute the centroid of these two points and refer to it as the centroid calculation. This will help me better understand the geographic intersection and its significance.</p></div></td></tr>
