Hi Mr. Bimbola,

Thank you again for the thorough work you put into locating the colonial-era land-grant parcels. I've reviewed the first batch and, as we discussed, a few points are ~30 km off from the location I obtained with additional references. That is **not** a problem from my side – the historical descriptions are genuinely ambiguous and I realise the task was probably trickier than it first looked.

When I first commissioned the work I intended to treat your file as the ground-truth dataset.  After seeing how much detective work a full verification would demand, I've changed plans: instead of asking for exhaustive accuracy, I've added a "Human GIS professional" method to my comparison table.  Your coordinates would serve as one benchmark alongside the AI models – only if you're happy with that.  If you'd rather not be included, the paper will simply omit that human row and keep your file private.

**What I'd like to do** (only if you're comfortable) is:

1. Treat your latitude/longitude file as a human baseline in my forthcoming accuracy / cost comparison.  
2. Report the performance exactly as I do for the AI models: mean Haversine error, cost (the full amount I am paying you), and latency (hours billed).

Nothing about the arrangement or compensation changes – you'll still receive the full **US $140** that we agreed, regardless of the final accuracy metrics.

If you would prefer I do not use your coordinates in that way, just let me know and I'll keep the data internal and off the record. Alternatively, if you'd like to refine a couple of the outliers (no more than ##### minutes – I don't want you to exceed the paid hours) I'm happy to receive an updated file.

Could you let me know your preference by reply? Feel free to add any conditions on attribution or anonymity – I can cite the dataset as "Human GIS baseline (professional freelancer, anonymised)" or I could cite you by name if you'd like to appear in the paper, whichever you prefer.

Many thanks again, and please don't hesitate if you have questions.

Best,
Ryan



Below is the abstract for the study:
1 Objectives & Research Questions
Colonial land-grant books contain thousands of terse place descriptions that have never been geocoded. Mapping them would open new lines of inquiry on early-eighteenth-century settlement diffusion, river-borne trade, and the origins of many modern towns. Manually locating every grant is prohibitively slow, so we test whether recent OpenAI language-and-reasoning models can infer reasonable latitude/longitude coordinates directly from the text.

Because no public or private dataset contains coordinates for these grants (including the Northern Neck volumes we will also sample), strong performance would indicate genuine spatial reasoning rather than memorisation.

Research questions

How accurate are different model families and prompt/tool pipelines when asked to geolocate a grant description? (distance error distribution)
How do monetary cost and latency trade off against that accuracy?
Does adding a geocoding tool (LLM → Google Maps API) improve performance over pure one-shot prompting?
How do the best AI methods compare to a professional human GIS baseline in both error and cost?
Which methods (human or AI) lie on the cost-accuracy Pareto frontier?





RESPONSE:
Hi Ryan,
 
Thank you for your thoughtful message and transparency about the study’s goals. I appreciate your flexibility in adjusting the project scope and am glad the coordinates can contribute meaningfully to your research.
 
Permissions & Preferences
You may use the geocoded data as the "Human GIS baseline" in your accuracy/cost comparison.
 
Attribution:
 
Please cite the dataset as "Human GIS Baseline (Bimbola Bashorun, GIS Professional)" with my name included.

Conditions
Email Confidentiality: To maintain separation from freelance platforms, kindly refrain from sharing my direct email in public-facing materials or with third parties.
 
Anonymity Option: If the peer review process requires anonymization, you may revert to "Professional GIS Analyst (Anonymized)" in the final publication.
 
Additional Notes
Career Alignment: Public attribution aligns with my professional goals, and I’m happy to contribute to advancing spatial humanities research.
 
Data Context: The coordinates were derived from historical descriptions that often lack modern landmarks or precise boundary references. Ambiguities in colonial-era terms (e.g., "adjacent to John Guillum’s land") inherently limit precision, so a 30km error band aligns with expectations.
 
Collaboration: If the journal requires methodological details or a supplemental technical note, I’m open to collaborating further.
 
Thank you again for the opportunity to contribute. Best of luck with the paper – I look forward to reading it!
 
Best regards,
Bimbola Bashorun
