REASONING STEP 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Geolocating land grant**  The user is asking for precise latitude and
longitude coordinates for a colonial Virginia land grant. I need to
interpret the land grant description, which includes details about John
Small's 203 acres in Northern Neck Land. It might reference "New Land," and
it’s located in the Upper Parish of Nansemond County. I’ll look for the
Maple and Timber Pocosons, which are wetlands. Researching relevant
historical areas like Maple Swamp in Suffolk and Gates County should help
pinpoint the exact coordinates.

REASONING STEP 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Determining exact coordinates**  I need to find the exact coordinates for
a location within the 203 acres of land described. I’m gathering details
from genealogical resources about Thomas Speight and the Maple Pocoson
area. It seems there’s some complexity due to the overlap between locations
in Virginia and North Carolina. After considering points like the
Southeastern Virginia region and the Great Dismal Swamp, I think
coordinates around 36°40'12"N 76°37'30"W could be viable, but I still need
to refine this for accuracy.
