REASONING STEP 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Verifying Stony Creek's Flow**  I’m looking into Stony Creek in Sussex
County, which flows south into the Nottoway River near Jarratt. I believe
the creek’s coordinates are around 36.9158N, -77.4021W, but I'll check
again. The town's coordinates are 36.9468, -77.4044. The creek seems to
flow south-southwest, meeting the Nottoway River just east of Sussex Drive.
I’ll refine the exact coordinates for the mouth of the creek to ensure
accuracy, aiming for a precise reading.
