### Reasoning Summary
- **Exploring Hallaway Swamp**

There's mention of Hallaway Swamp near Church Rd, which is in Southeastern Prince George County close to Fort Lee and I95. Hallaway Swamp flows into Blackwater Swamp, with potential coordinates around 37.0971°N, 77.3819°W. I might also check "Hallaway Bridge Road," which crosses the swamp. There could be some confusion with Holloway Swamp. I think I should verify my memory and search for details about the area, particularly near West Quaker Road and Route 40 in Sussex. Let's figure this out!
- **Geolocating Holloway Swamp**

I’m focusing on Holloway Swamp in Prince George County, Virginia, potentially around the coordinates 37.1368127, -77.3427569. I’m trying to remember details about the colonial land grant of 400 acres located on the south side of Blackwater Swamp near the confluence with Holloway Swamp. I’m exploring local streams and recalling various place names, like Arthur Swamp and Blackwater Swamp. This involves analyzing historical land records from "Cavaliers and Pioneers" to geolocate to present-day coordinates and understand the area's topography.
- **Investigating Hallaway Swamp**

I’m thinking about Hallaway Swamp in Prince George County, with approximate coordinates around 37.0648619°N, 77.2544201°W. I want to check these coordinates more carefully and derive high-precision values, specifically in the required format. I believe Hallaway Swamp flows from the southwestern part of Southeastern Virginia. Additionally, there's a connection to the Blackwater River and its shape is essential to understanding the area. I need to revisit historical records from 1703 to clarify details about the county's origins, which might be relevant here. Let's keep refining our understanding!
### Prediction
`37°04'23.98800"N 077°12'28.99900"W`

- **Locating features**

I'm looking at the coordinates 37.1593, -77.2405, which seem to be highlighted within Prince George County. It appears to possibly correspond to the Holloway Swamp feature. I should inspect this further to check its plausibility. Notably, this area is near Blackwater Swamp, which has coordinates around 37.15, ranging from -77.3 to -77.2. This proximity makes sense, so I'll also try to find more details about Blackwater Swamp to confirm everything.
- **Calculating centroid location**

I’ve got the coordinates of 37.1733, -77.2397, which are close to Holloway Swamp's location. The description suggests it’s on the south side of Blackwater Swamp near Holloway Swamp's run. This implies the coordinates might be centered between the two swamps. Since they’re only 0.014 degrees apart in latitude, I’ll calculate the centroid based on these anchor points and see what the average location tells me. This should help pinpoint the approximate area accurately.
- **Formatting coordinates correctly**

Okay, I've got the final coordinates: 37.166303, -77.240091. But I need to format them with six decimal places. So I’ll round them both: 37.166303 and -77.240091 are already at six decimal places. I also need to check that I can only use the centroid function once, which I have. It looks like I used a total of three calls, but for now, I just need to output the coordinates.
