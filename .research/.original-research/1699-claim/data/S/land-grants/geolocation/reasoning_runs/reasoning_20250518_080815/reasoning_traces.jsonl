I remember that Holloway flows into Blackwater Swamp near Disputanta. Blackwater River originates near Petersburg and flows south along the border. I think I remember the coordinates for Holloway Swamp being about 37.021N 77.283W. It's possible there's another Holloway in Isle of Wight or Surry County.

From my memory, the coordinates for Holloway Swamp are approximately 37.086\u00b0N and 77.345\u00b0W. However, I'll produce a more precise estimate of 37.0500\u00b0N and 77.2700\u00b0W.
