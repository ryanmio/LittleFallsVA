### Reasoning Summary
- **Verifying Stony Creek's Flow**

I’m looking into Stony Creek in Sussex County, which flows south into the Nottoway River near Jarratt. I believe the creek’s coordinates are around 36.9158N, -77.4021W, but I'll check again. The town's coordinates are 36.9468, -77.4044. The creek seems to flow south-southwest, meeting the Nottoway River just east of Sussex Drive. I’ll refine the exact coordinates for the mouth of the creek to ensure accuracy, aiming for a precise reading.
### Prediction
`36°52'24.92399"N 77°24'16.59600"W`

### Reasoning Summary
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d25748a88191aa08b648ab5a96d601717f553d5d0737', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- **Analyzing location data**

The API provided coordinates for Stony Creek, VA, specifically at lat 36.9479277 and lng -77.4008113. This likely points to the unincorporated community rather than the mouth of the creek. I see that these coordinates are near the town, positioned along I-95. Stony Creek is actually around lat 37.0, lng -77.4, and the stream flows south before reaching the Nottoway River around lat 36.8. I’ll search for “Stony Creek Mouth Nottoway River Virginia” to clarify.
- **Refining river coordinates**

I’m looking at the Nottoway River coordinates around 36.7869, -77.4446. They might just represent the central point of the river. To get more specific information, I think it would be useful to refine this by checking for the nearest roadways or landmarks. That way, I can provide a more accurate and relevant location related to the river, which could be helpful for the user. Let’s see what I can find!
- **Tweaking geocoding strategy**

I'm still getting general results, so I think I should refine my search. Let's try geocoding the mouth of Stony Creek by searching for "Stony Creek (Sussex County) Virginia." However, it’s possible that it won't yield a specific geocode. Another option is to search for "Stony Creek Virginia tributary of Nottoway River," but that might still produce similar general results. Perhaps I should focus on geocoding "Nottoway River & Stony Creek intersection." I'll give that approach another shot!
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d2690794819194623ff211d27ed001717f553d5d0737', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- **Considering geocoding options**

I think the geocoder might be lumping places together or not giving precise results. One idea could be to approximate by searching for "Stony Creek, Dinwiddie County, Virginia," but I also want to consider Sussex. It might work better to search specifically for "Stony Creek (creek), Virginia" to narrow things down! Let’s see if that yields a clearer result.
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d27028d08191b56e0087b84d1dac01717f553d5d0737', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- **Evaluating coordinates for marshlands**

I've found coordinates for Southwest Swamp at 36.91953666, -77.44131813, which seems quite close to Stony Creek. I confirm that "Southwest Swamp" is indeed near Stony Creek and the Nottoway River, giving me one solid anchor point. The description indicates that the tract lies between the mouth of Stony Creek and this swamp. However, I still need to geocode the actual mouth of Stony Creek, as the closest I have for it is a general location in the town of Stony Creek.
- **Finding the centroid location**

The area between the mouth and the swamp likely places the centroid somewhere in the middle. I'm thinking that the centroid might be north of the actual mouth but still within the general area. To improve accuracy, I want to geocode "Stony Creek Landing, Sussex County, Virginia." That should help refine my understanding of the mouth location further. Let’s see what I can find with this new information!
- **Exploring anchor points**

I'm thinking about searching for "Johnsons Millpond," but we already have two plausible anchor points: Stony Creek (town) and Southwest Swamp, both in Sussex County along the Nottoway River. Stony Creek isn't at the mouth but runs along it. Should I compute the centroid? The phrase "beginning at the mouth of Stony Creek to the Southwest Swamp" gives us strong anchors, but I want a more accurate mouth coordinate. Maybe geocoding "Hunting Quarter Plantation, Sussex County, VA" could help.
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d28247708191af46702abb27220701717f553d5d0737', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d284154c8191854cb57aca85355301717f553d5d0737', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- **Evaluating coordinates and swamp location**

I'm looking at the latitude differences, with town coordinates at 36.9489 and the swamp at 36.9195, which shows about a 3.3 km difference. The mouth of the swamp is expected to be south of Stony Creek town and might be around 36.8. So, the town is north of the swamp, but the swamp could be further south. 

I'll focus on the southwestern swamp's coordinates since these might better represent the area along the Nottoway River. Let's check on that specific coordinate to clarify further.
- **Finalizing swamp coordinates**

The Nottoway River runs from about -77.4 to -77.5, so the swamp’s coordinates should be near there. I need to ensure my coordinates are plausible, and I do have two geocode calls ready. I’ll present the final coordinates as 36.919537, -77.441318 with six decimal places for accuracy. I just confirmed the rounding is correct too. This location falls within the southeastern Sussex County area, close to the southwestern swamp. Time to output those!

### Reasoning Summary
- **Geolocating land grant**

The user is asking for precise latitude and longitude coordinates for a colonial Virginia land grant. I need to interpret the land grant description, which includes details about John Small's 203 acres in Northern Neck Land. It might reference "New Land," and it’s located in the Upper Parish of Nansemond County. I’ll look for the Maple and Timber Pocosons, which are wetlands. Researching relevant historical areas like Maple Swamp in Suffolk and Gates County should help pinpoint the exact coordinates.
- **Determining exact coordinates**

I need to find the exact coordinates for a location within the 203 acres of land described. I’m gathering details from genealogical resources about Thomas Speight and the Maple Pocoson area. It seems there’s some complexity due to the overlap between locations in Virginia and North Carolina. After considering points like the Southeastern Virginia region and the Great Dismal Swamp, I think coordinates around 36°40'12"N 76°37'30"W could be viable, but I still need to refine this for accuracy.
### Prediction
`36°43'57.6000"N 76°35'43.7640"W`

## T-2 (tool_chain)

### Reasoning Summary
- **Researching historic land grants**

I have a land grant description from colonial-era Virginia in the Upper Parish of Nansemond County. It mentions the Maple Pocoson near the Timber Pocoson. I need to clarify these locations today known as part of Suffolk, VA, since "pocoson" means swamp—so Maple Pocoson might refer to Maple Swamp. I should search for "Maple Swamp, Suffolk, Virginia" to find coordinates and better understand these areas. Let's see what I can find!
- ResponseReasoningItem(id='rs_6829d2b9f4448191a762d48c17687d380e786ccd30a9723a', summary=[], type='reasoning', status=None)
- **Searching for Maple Swamp**

I'm not getting useful info about general Suffolk, so I'm thinking Maple Pocoson might actually refer to Maple Swamp, which could be part of the Great Dismal Swamp today. I wonder if there's more info about Maple Swamp in Nansemond County, Virginia, that could clarify things. Let’s see what I can find by searching for "Maple Swamp, Nansemond County, Virginia" to hopefully get some specifics!
- **Exploring names for wetlands**

I'm trying to brainstorm different names for "Timber Pocoson." Maybe "Timber Swamp" or "Timber Creek" could be more fitting options. There’s something appealing about these names that evoke the nature of wetlands. I want to make sure whatever I choose resonates well with the landscape I am considering. It’s fun to think creatively about this and see what fits best. Let's see what else I can come up with!
- **Clarifying the Maple Pocoson Reference**

I'm stepping back to consider that Maple Pocoson might refer to present-day Maple Swamp in Chesapeake. Interestingly, it could link to Maple Pocosin in North Carolina, which is a swamp in Currituck County near Maple, NC. But Nansemond County is north. It seems Maple Pocoson might actually correspond to the "Maple Swamp" within the Great Dismal Swamp refuge. I'll look up "Maple Swamp, Chesapeake, VA" to clarify further.
- **Searching for Maple Pocosin**

Alright, I think it would be better to include "in" when searching for "Maple Pocosin." That might help narrow down the results and provide more relevant information. It’s always interesting to see what comes up and how the context shifts with small word changes. I’m looking for details specifically related to the Maple Pocosin, so refining the search seems like a good idea! Let's see what I can find!
- **Finding coordinates for Suffolk**

I'm looking at Poquoson city, which isn't ideal for my needs. I think I might have to settle for general Suffolk instead. I found a possible anchor point at 36.7282054, -76.5835621, which is labeled as the center of Suffolk, but it's actually in Nansemond County. I wonder if I need a second anchor to compute a centroid. Since I don’t have one, I might just go with that coordinate and perhaps search for Timber Creek in Suffolk.
- **Analyzing location coordinates**

I found coordinates 36.905, -76.501, which are near Chuckatuck in Suffolk, likely reflecting the creek's influence. Yes, this indeed falls within Nansemond County. I’m weighing two anchor points: the generic center of Suffolk and Timber Creek. The property description mentions "Maple Pocoson" and Timber Pocoson, which suggests they might be situated between them. I'll look for "Maple Swamp Ln" or "Maple Ln" within the Great Dismal Swamp and check out "Maple Swamp Rd, Suffolk, VA."
- **Exploring locations**

I’m trying to figure out where Maple Hall Ln is — I think it’s northwest of Suffolk, possibly near Windsor, in Isle of Wight County? That doesn’t seem right, though. I could look up "Maple Pocosin Dismal Swamp" to get more specific information. I wonder what I'll find if I search that way! I just want to make sure I’m getting the right details for the best understanding of the area.
- **Searching for Timber Pocosons**

I want to explore the location of Maple Swamp, but now I think I should focus on Virginia, possibly near the Maple and Timber Pocosons. They might be close to the northern part of Great Dismal Swamp. So far, I've made eight tool calls, like Maple Swamp in Suffolk and others. Since I can still make a couple more calls, maybe it’s a good idea to search for "Timber Pocoson, Suffolk" for more relevant information.
- **Selecting coordinates for Timber Creek**

Okay, I've decided to choose the Timber Creek coordinate since it’s directly linked to the 'Timber' feature. The coordinates will be 36.905061, -76.501490. But I want to ensure the precision is right, so I’ll keep six decimal places: 36.905061, -76.501490. It looks like I have the rounding in order, with latitude at 36.9050614 and longitude at -76.50149. Now, let's finalize this!

### Reasoning Summary
- **Finding intersection coordinates**

I need to find a precise coordinate that represents the "beginning" of the tract or the approximate centroid. The tract starts near Capt Damerfield's and goes down the south branch of Crump's Creek to the mouth of Gentry's Branch. It seems I need the intersection where Gentry's Branch meets the South Branch of Crump Creek. I'll look for these streams on the map and approximate the coordinate to around 37.7900N, -77.5900W.
- **Investigating Crump Creek location**

I’m looking into the Crump Creek location in Hanover County near Montpelier, around coordinates 37.780N, -77.690. Montpelier itself sits at 37.82N, -77.67W, so I suspect Crump Creek is on the south side. I remember Crump's Millpond, part of the Diascund Creek network in New Kent, but that's more southeast. Genealogical records suggest Crump's Creek is in Hanover, with references to early land ownership. I'll estimate a coordinate of about 37.788N, -77.546W, but I want to refine it further by researching offline.

- **Evaluating geographical coordinates**

I’m reviewing the geocoder’s return of generic Crump Creek coordinates, which are likely at 37.7077, -77.3296. This location is east of what I initially expected but still in Hanover County. I need to consider whether this placement near Ashland makes sense. Since -77.3296 is east of -77.5, it’s possibly closer to the New Kent line. So, next, I might check the Gentry Branch location in Hanover County, Virginia.
- **Evaluating location details**

It seems the latitude and longitude points might be referencing the center of Hanover County, which isn’t ideal, but still a plausible anchor. I could consider "Gentry Creek Hanover" or a variant like "Gentrys Branch." The coordinates I have, 37.7772, -77.5161, do seem to fit. The rule shows this qualifies as a plausible anchor, although it might not be completely accurate. I might compute the centroid between Crump Creek and Gentry Branch for a better approximation of the land described.
- **Refining location coordinates**

I’m thinking about computing the centroid between points in Crump Creek and Gentry Branch. However, using generic points might not yield accurate results. I could try finding a coordinate for "Crumps Creek Hanover" around 37.7667, -77.5167. To improve precision, I should refine my search to "Crumps Creek Ashland VA" to better understand the area's layout and get a more accurate reference point. This could really help clarify things!
- **Refining location details**

I've got the coordinates 37.7590, -77.4800 down. It’s potentially better than my earlier attempt. I think it's important to refine this further by identifying the natural feature more clearly. It looks like “South Branch Crumps Creek” fits, but I want to ensure I’m spot on. I’ll check to make sure it aligns correctly and that I’m capturing the right geographical feature. Let's see if we can fully clarify this!
- **Considering strategy adjustments**

It looks like my previous suggestion returned some generic results, which isn't ideal. I'm thinking about trying "Crump Creek Hanover County" again but with a more focused or restricted strategy this time. I want to ensure that the information I gather is more relevant and specific. It's important to refine how I approach this to get better results for the user. Let’s see how that goes!
- **Computing coordinates for Crump Creek**

I'm trying to find a specific location by calculating the centroid between two plausible coordinates: Crump Creek and Gentry Branch. The coordinates I have are 37.7590, -77.4800 for Crump Creek and 37.7772, -77.5161 for Gentry Branch. I’m estimating the centroid to be around 37.7681, -77.4980, which might be close to the mouth region. Since these two anchor points are both in Hanover County, I think it's a good approach to pinpoint the location.

### Reasoning Summary
- **Exploring Holloway Swamp**

I'm looking into Holloway Swamp, which might be in Prince George County near Disputanta. I remember there being a Holloway Swamp along Route 156, and it connects with Blackwater Swamp in Prince George County near Newville. I want to ensure my mental mapping is accurate since Blackwater Swamp runs along the border of Prince George and Sussex counties. It seems that Holloway Swamp could be flowing south to north. Let’s analyze the names further!
- **Locating Coordinates for Holloway Swamp**

I'm considering the farmland south of Holloway Swamp, looking for a precise location to approximate the area, which is about 400 acres near an intersection. I want to find accurate latitude and longitude, ideally at the confluence of Holloway and Blackwater Swamps. I’m estimating the coordinates around 37.004°N and 77.152°W based on nearby sites. I recall that the Blackwater Swamp crosses I-95 around 37.05°N and -77.37°W, which might help narrow it down further.

## T-2 (tool_chain)

### Reasoning Summary
- **Locating Blackwater and Holloway Swamps**

I need to parse a land grant description from 1703 mentioning "the S side of the main Black Water Swamp" and locate the southwestern side of it. I know Blackwater Swamp is in southeastern Virginia, specifically in Prince George County, and flows into the Blackwater River. There's a part of it in Surry County too. I'm curious if Holloway Swamp is a small tributary and if it's in Prince George or Sussex County. I'll search for Holloway Swamp in Virginia to clarify.
- **Confirming swamp coordinates**

I've noted the coordinates for Holloway Swamp in Sussex County, which seem plausible. Next, I want to confirm the location of Blackwater Swamp's larger trunk. The description indicates it's on the south side of the main Black Water Swamp, near the meeting point of Holloway Swamp. So, I need to geocode the intersection where Holloway Swamp flows into Blackwater Swamp for further clarity. Let's move to that step!
- **Determining intersection coordinates**

I'm looking at the coordinates 37.1081, -77.1514, which seem to place me in northeastern Sussex County near the Prince George border. I've noted Holloway Swamp's coordinates at 36.9058, -77.2405, about 0.2 degrees south and slightly west. It might be useful to calculate the centroid between these two points since the description mentions being near the branch of Holloway Swamp, specifically on the south side of Blackwater Swamp. This could help approximate the intersection at the mouth of Holloway Swamp.

- **Checking locations and features**

I found the coordinates 37.1733, -77.2397, which might be along Blackwater Dr, near Waverly and perhaps close to the center of Prince George. But then I noticed the coordinates for Holloway Swamp at 36.9058, which is located in southwestern Sussex, so there's a mismatch. It's possible there could be two features named Holloway Swamp. I think it's worth checking the alternate spelling "Halloway Swamp" to clarify this.
- **Clarifying locations**

I’m trying to pin down Holloway Swamp's location at coordinates 36.9058 -77.2405, near the Virginia and North Carolina border, not far from the Blackwater River. I think it might actually be in Isle of Wight or Southampton counties. Alternatively, there's the Blackwater Swamp in Prince George County, which flows into a Blackwater River. There are two Blackwater Rivers in Virginia, but the southeastern one forms the border of Isle of Wight and Southampton County.
- **Refining the search**

I’m considering searching for "Connells Mill pond blackwater swamp," but it might be better to narrow it down. Instead, I think "Holloway Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia" would be more focused and likely yield better results. Targeting my search this way could help me get the specific information I need. It’s all about finding the right keywords, so let’s go with that!
- **Refining coordinates for Blackwater Swamp**

I’m analyzing the coordinates: lat 37.1593, long -77.2405. This puts me near Blackwater Swamp, which we previously had as 37.1081, -77.1514. The latitude difference of about 0.051 equals roughly 5.6 km north, while the longitude difference of about 0.089 translates to approximately 7.4 km west. I’m considering that if we mention the "south side of Blackwater Swamp," the Holloway coordinate might actually be north of it. Maybe we need to look closer to around 37.094? Let’s refine this further.
- **Evaluating coordinates and centroid**

I found the coordinates 37.1733, -77.2397, which seem to relate to Prince George. It looks like Google is referencing a point near Blackwater Swamp, and this is quite close to Holloway Swamp's coordinates. They appear to overlap nicely. Considering multiple possible locations, I can compute a centroid between these two swamps, landing at approximately 37.1663, -77.2400. However, since the description specifies the south side of Blackwater Swamp, shifting slightly south might be the best approach.
- **Calculating the centroid**

I’ve identified two anchor points: Blackwater Swamp to the north and Holloway Swamp oriented north-south. The land sits on the south side of Blackwater, intersecting with Holloway, which is around latitude 37.165 and longitude -77.24. To find a representative location, I'll compute the centroid of these two points and refer to it as the centroid calculation. This will help me better understand the geographic intersection and its significance.

### Reasoning Summary
- **Finding precise coordinates**

I'm trying to approximate a vantage point near Colosse, in King William County, along VA 30, near the intersection with Cohoke Road. It's better to focus on St. John's Church for coordinates since it's a notable landmark. I remember that St. John's Church is located at 5987 Old Indian Fields Rd., West Point, VA. I estimate the coordinates as 37.6170°N, 76.9973°W. It's interesting because there are actually two St. John's in Virginia, one in West Point and another in King William.
- **Refining coordinates for analysis**

I'm considering a vantage point near Macon's line, specifically by Piscataway Creek, which is east of St. John's Church. I’ll use the coordinates 37.6336° N, -76.9383° W but know we still have to be cautious with approximations. I’m looking at a broader view of King William County, including West Point. I want to provide precise latitude and longitude for a larger area, especially along the Pamunkey River and near key historical sites. I'm taking care to compute everything accurately as I zero in on the ideal coordinates.
- **Finalizing coordinates**

I'm working on producing the coordinates in the correct format: 37°37'49.00000"N 076°59'26.00000"W. I need to ensure the longitude shows three digits, so it looks like 076. Now, let’s convert these decimal degrees. For latitude, 37.6303 yields roughly 37°37'49.080". For longitude, -76.9906 converts to about 76°59'26.160". So my final coordinates will appear as 37°37'49.08000"N 076°59'26.16000"W. I’m ready to go ahead with this!
### Prediction
`37°37'49.08000"N 076°59'26.16000"W`

### Reasoning Summary
- **Geolocating Pamunkey Neck**

I need to geolocate 418 acres owned by James Terry in the Pamunkey Neck area, located in King and Queen County. This peninsula sits between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers. I should consider how to find precise coordinates, likely around the central Pamunkey Neck. I’m thinking about adjacent land references tied to the Macon plantation, probably linked to historical figures. My next step is to craft a geolocation query for "Pamunkey Neck, Virginia" to get the central coordinate.
- **Searching for specific coordinates**

The geocoder gave me "King and Queen County, VA, USA," which isn't that specific. The coordinates, lat 37.7298 and long -76.895, seem typical for the county center, but they might not be accurate. I think I’ll need more precision. One idea is to incorporate "Pamunkey Neck King William County, Virginia" for better context. Let’s search for more detailed information to clarify this.
- **Refining location details**

I've got the coordinates and address for Pamunkey Nck Ln, which seems to be a road in the Pamunkey Neck area. This location is in Virginia and fits with what I expect. Checking the coordinates, lat 37.799 and lon -77.334, they're indeed central between the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers. However, I still want to fine-tune this with "St. John's Parish, King and Queen County, Virginia." Let's take a closer look!

- **Confirming coordinates**

I'm focusing on the central Pamunkey Neck area, since the information about Macon in Powhatan County isn’t relevant. I’ll use the coordinates from the second call, 37.7990801, -77.3347627, but first, let’s check if they’re reasonable. These coordinates are in King William County, which is adjacent to King & Queen County, making them plausible. I'll return the coordinates formatted with six decimal places: 37.799080, -77.334763.
