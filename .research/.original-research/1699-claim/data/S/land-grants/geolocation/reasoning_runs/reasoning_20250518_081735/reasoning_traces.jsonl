Hallaway Swamp flows into Blackwater Swamp, with potential coordinates around 37.0971\u00b0N, 77.3819\u00b0W. I might also check \"Hallaway Bridge Road,\" which crosses the swamp. There could be some confusion with Holloway Swamp. I think I should verify my memory and search for details about the area, particularly near West Quaker Road and Route 40 in Sussex. Let's figure this out!", "**Geolocating Holloway Swamp**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on Holloway Swamp in Prince George County, Virginia, potentially around the coordinates 37.1368127, -77.3427569. I\u2019m trying to remember details about the colonial land grant of 400 acres located on the south side of Blackwater Swamp near the confluence with Holloway Swamp. I\u2019m exploring local streams and recalling various place names, like Arthur Swamp and Blackwater Swamp. This involves analyzing historical land records from \"Cavaliers and Pioneers\" to geolocate to present-day coordinates and understand the area's topography.", "**Investigating Hallaway Swamp**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about Hallaway Swamp in Prince George County, with approximate coordinates around 37.0648619\u00b0N, 77.2544201\u00b0W. I want to check these coordinates more carefully and derive high-precision values, specifically in the required format. I believe Hallaway Swamp flows from the southwestern part of Southeastern Virginia. Additionally, there's a connection to the Blackwater River and its shape is essential to understanding the area. I need to revisit historical records from 1703 to clarify details about the county's origins, which might be relevant here.
