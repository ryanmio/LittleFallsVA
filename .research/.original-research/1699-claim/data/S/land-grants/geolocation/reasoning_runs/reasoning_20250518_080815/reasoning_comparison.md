### Reasoning Summary
- **Geolocating Colonial Land Grant**

I need to pinpoint a colonial Virginia land grant of 400 acres, possibly on the south side of Blackwater Swamp, dated April 24, 1703. First, I’ll confirm where Blackwater Swamp is located—it appears to be in Prince George County, Virginia, along the Blackwater River. I also need to consider Holloway Swamp, which is a tributary. The goal is to find the exact coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds, and hundredths. Time to research!
- **Analyzing Swamp Locations**

It seems that the main Black Water Swamp might be near the Prince George and Sussex border, with Holloway Swamp as a tributary. I remember that Holloway flows into Blackwater Swamp near Disputanta. Blackwater River originates near Petersburg and flows south along the border. I think I remember the coordinates for Holloway Swamp being about 37.021N 77.283W. It's possible there's another Holloway in Isle of Wight or Surry County. I'll have to consider all these details about the land grant from 1703 in Prince George County!
- **Locating Blackwater Swamp Coordinates**

I need to clarify that Blackwater Swamp, which flows south-southeast in Southeastern Virginia, becomes Blackwater River at its confluence with Three Creek. From my memory, the coordinates for Holloway Swamp are approximately 37.086°N and 77.345°W. However, I'll produce a more precise estimate of 37.0500°N and 77.2700°W. Converting that to degrees, minutes, and seconds, we get 37°03'00.00000"N and 77°16'12.00000"W. It's important to deliver this accurately for the user's needs!
### Prediction
`37°03'00.00000"N 077°16'12.00000"W`

### Reasoning Summary
- **Interpreting land grants**

I need to interpret a land grant from 1703 for William Williams, which includes 400 acres on the south side of the main Blackwater Swamp near Holloway Swamp. To understand the coordinates, I'm recalling that Blackwater Swamp is between Prince George County and Sussex in Virginia, flowing into the Blackwater River near Petersburg. Holloway Swamp is likely a tributary to Blackwater. I should start with a search for "Holloway Swamp, Prince George County, Virginia" to gather geocode information.
- **Exploring coordinates**

I’ve got coordinates 37.1593, -77.2405, which could be near Blackwater Swamp. It seems like a good idea to look into that area next. I’ll check out more details about Blackwater Swamp located in Prince George. It’s fascinating how specific coordinates can lead me to such unique natural spots. Maybe I’ll find out more about this area’s features and what makes it interesting! Let’s see what I can discover.
- **Calculating centroid location**

I’m working with coordinates: 37.1733, -77.2397. It seems like Blackwater Swamp and Holloway Swamp are close to each other. Based on the description, the property lies on the south side of main Blackwater Swamp and along Holloway Swamp. I’m thinking we can average the two coordinates to find an approximate central point between them. So, I’ll compute the centroid using these two anchor points. Let’s go ahead and calculate that!
- **Calculating midpoint coordinates**

I'm figuring out the midpoint coordinates between Holloway and Blackwater Swamp. It seems like the coordinates 37.166303, -77.240091 make sense as a plausible centroid. I’ll ensure these coordinates are correct and formatted with six decimal places for precision. That looks good! I’m ready to present these coordinates. They’re fitting for the task of locating the midpoint, so let's proceed with sharing them.
