# Colonial Virginia Land Grants: Mapping the Past - FAQ

## About the Project

### What is this project about?
This project aims to geolocate colonial-era Virginia land grants that have never been systematically mapped. By placing these historical records on a map, we can better understand early-eighteenth-century settlement patterns, river-borne trade, and the origins of many modern towns.

### Why is this work important?
Colonial land-grant books contain thousands of terse place descriptions that have never been geocoded. Mapping them opens new lines of inquiry for historians, geographers, and genealogists. Your contributions help create the first comprehensive dataset of these important historical documents.

### Who is running this project?
This research is being conducted by academic researchers interested in colonial American history and historical geography. The project combines expertise in historical archives, geographical information systems (GIS), and artificial intelligence.

## Getting Started

### How do I participate?
1. Read the brief tutorial on the project page
2. Look at the historical land grant text provided
3. Click on the map where you believe the described land was located
4. Submit your classification and move to the next entry

### Do I need special expertise to contribute?
No special expertise is required! While familiarity with Virginia geography or colonial history can be helpful, our tutorial provides all the context you need. We've designed the interface to be intuitive for everyone.

### What if I'm not sure about a location?
That's completely fine! Multiple volunteers will review each entry, and we'll use the consensus to determine the most likely location. If you're really uncertain, you can use the "discuss" button to ask questions or skip to the next entry.

## Understanding Land Grants

### What is a land grant?
A land grant was an official document giving ownership of a piece of land from the government to an individual or group. In colonial Virginia, these grants were recorded in books maintained by government officials.

### How do I interpret the land grant descriptions?
Each land grant typically includes:
- The grantee's name (who received the land)
- Acreage amount
- County and parish location
- Natural features like rivers, creeks, or swamps
- Neighboring landowners
- Date of the grant
- Page number in the original record book

### What do abbreviations like "acs.", "N.L.", and "Co." mean?
- acs. = acres
- N.L. = New Land (previously ungranted land)
- Co. = County
- Par. = Parish
- Sw. = Swamp
- Br. = Branch

## Technical Details

### How accurate does my click need to be?
Please try to be as precise as possible, but we understand these historical descriptions can be vague. Aim to click within a few miles of where you believe the land was located.

### Will I see the same entry multiple times?
No, you won't see the same entry again once you've classified it, but other volunteers may see the same entries.

### How is this data being used?
Your contributions will help create a comprehensive dataset of geocoded colonial land grants. This dataset will be used for academic research and will eventually be made available to other researchers and the public.

### What if the entry doesn't contain enough information to locate?
Some entries may be challenging to locate. If after a careful reading you still cannot determine a location, you can skip the entry using the "Skip" button.

## Contact and Further Information

### I have more questions or feedback. How can I contact the research team?
Please use the "Talk" boards within the Zooniverse project to discuss entries or ask questions. For direct inquiries, you can contact the research team at [project_email@example.com].
