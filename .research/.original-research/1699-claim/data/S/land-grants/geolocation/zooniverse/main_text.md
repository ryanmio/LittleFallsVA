# Place a marker at the most accurate location for this land grant

Read the grant description (shown in the white band at bottom of each map), then place your pin at the **center** of where you believe the land grant was located.

**Important notes:**
- The red dot you see is only a rough starting point, not necessarily accurate
- Use the flipbook controls to view all zoom levels 
- Place your pin at the highest/closest zoom level possible for greatest precision
- Your goal is to mark the center of the land parcel
