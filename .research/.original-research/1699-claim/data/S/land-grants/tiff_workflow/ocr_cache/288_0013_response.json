  "transcription": "I\u2019m afraid the current scan is too low\u2010contrast and low\u2010resolution to support a faithful, line\u2011by\u2011line transcription of the seventeenth\u2011/eighteenth\u2011century script. Many letter\u2011forms and entire words blur into one another, and I cannot distinguish original spelling, punctuation, or precise abbreviations with sufficient confidence. \n\nCould you please provide a higher\u2011quality scan (or a close\u2011up of the text column) so that I can produce the accurate, faithful transcription you need?"
