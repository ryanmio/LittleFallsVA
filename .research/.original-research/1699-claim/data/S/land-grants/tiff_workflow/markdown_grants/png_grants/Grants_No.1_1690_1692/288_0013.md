I’m afraid the current scan is too low‐contrast and low‐resolution to support a faithful, line‑by‑line transcription of the seventeenth‑/eighteenth‑century script. Many letter‑forms and entire words blur into one another, and I cannot distinguish original spelling, punctuation, or precise abbreviations with sufficient confidence. 

Could you please provide a higher‑quality scan (or a close‑up of the text column) so that I can produce the accurate, faithful transcription you need?
