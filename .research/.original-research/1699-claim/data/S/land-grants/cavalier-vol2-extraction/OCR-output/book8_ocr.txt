INDEX
A NOTE TO THE USER

PERSONAL Names. The user of this index should be as imaginative in his pursuit of a
surname as a seventeenth-century clerk might have been in his spelling. Variant spellings
of personal names in the abstracts appear unchanged in the index. The indexer has not
presumed to decide, for example, whether the John Abbot mentioned on page 115 is the
same person as the Jno. Abot mentioned on page 362. Titles of military rank, which may
have changed during the subjects’ lifetimes, have been omitted from the index when both
the given name and the title are present in the abstracts. Thus, under the entry Abraball
the three page numbers for the subentry Col. indicate that in each of those locations no
given name appears in the abstract. In such cases the user is allowed to decide for himself
whether the Col. Abrahall mentioned in a 1691 patent on page 360 is the same Robert
Abrahall who had patented land in 1654, according to a patent abstracted on page 30.
Researchers interested in groups within the population may also consult the subject
headings INDIANS and NEGROES.

PLACE-NAMES. Minor variant spellings of place-names and variant abbreviations of
geographical terms have not been retained in the index; for example, the index entry
Accomack does not show that in a patent on page 133 the word is spelled Accamack, nor
does the subject entry Counties, Accomack, reflect other variations in spelling that may
appear in the abstracts. Again, the user should remember that colonial clerks were
recording names for which there were no standard English spellings and that the index
consolidates only the obvious variant spellings of place-names. No attempt is made to
indicate the best or most frequent spellings of place-names used during the late seventeenth
century. Researchers may consult the following subject headings that appear in the index
in capital letters:

Bays LANDINGS PONDS
BRANCHES MARSHES QUARTERS
BRIDGES MEADOWS RIDGES
BROOKS MILLS RIVERS
COUNTIES NECKS ROADS
CREEKS PARISHES RUNS
Dams PATHS SHIPS
FIELDS PLANTATIONS SLASHES
GuTS POCOSINS SPRINGS
INLETS POINTS SWAMPS
ISLANDS VALLEYS

ALPHABETIZING. Main entries in this index are arranged in letter-by-letter alphabetical
order.
