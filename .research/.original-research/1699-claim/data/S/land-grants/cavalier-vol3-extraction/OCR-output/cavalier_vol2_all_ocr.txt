HE appearance of volume three completes the publica-
tion of Cavaliers and Pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia
Land Patents and Grants, a work supported by Agnes
Bernadine Sitterding and prepared by Nell Marion
Nugent, who was custodian of the Land Office from
1925 to 1958. She had planned to abstract the seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century patent books in a series of five volumes. Her ab-
stracts of patent books 1 through 5 were published as volume one in
1934. Type was set for patent books 6 through 14, but then circum-
stances caused Miss Sitterding to abandon the project. The corrected
page proofs survived. From them the Virginia State Library published
the abstracts of patent books 6, 7, and 8 as volume two in 1977.
Volume three contains all the remaining abstracts, for patent books 9
through 14!

Researchers acquainted with volumes one and two of Cavaliers and
Pioneers will notice a major change in the records abstracted in volume
three. The Virginia Land Office records chronicle seventeenth-century
immigration, but, because the headright system fell into desuetude,
extensive lists of immigrants generally are not found in eighteenth-
century land patents. On June 21, 1699, the governor and Council
established the treasury right, whereby a person paying five shillings
to the auditor gained “‘the same liberty to take up and patent fifty acres
of lands which {he} would otherwise have had for the Importacon of
any of his Majesties Subjects into this Dominion.” In this volume the
earliest notice of this policy appears (at page 26) in the note affixed to
a June 6, 1699, patent issued to Joseph Perry: “3 rights paid for to
Mr. Auditor Byrd as by certificate.” Mention of the purchase of

1. Nell Marion Nugent, Cavaliers and Pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents
and Grants, vol. 1 {1623-1666} (Richmond, 1934; reprint ed., Baltimore, 1974);
vol. 2 {1666-1695} (Richmond, 1977). Publication of vol. 1 superseded a series of
Nugent’s abstracts published under the title Cavaliers and Pioneers: A Calendar of
Virginia Land Grants, 1623-1800, 6 nos. (Richmond, 1929-1931); all information
in the serial publication is found in vol. 1.

treasury rights appears again in several April 1700 patents (at page 37),
and with increasing frequency thereafter. The revival of the treasury
right in 1699—by which rights to large quantities of land could be
obtained without transporting settlers into the colony—and the open-
ing of Northern Neck lands about 1690 contributed to the formation
of the huge estates held by members of Virginia’s eighteenth-century
elite.?

Two other changes are reflected in the abstracts contained in this
volume. First, on April 15, 1699, the practice of allowing headrights
for the importation of blacks was discontinued. Having decided that
the “taking up of Land” was a privilege “restrained to His Majesty’s
Subjects comeing to inhabite in this His Colony and Dominion,” the
governor and Council “resolved, and accordingly Established for a
Rule, that His Majesty’s Land in this Colony ought not to be granted
to any others then His Christian Subjects comeing to reside here.”
Second, in patent books 10 through 14 the clerks distinguished between
new land, old land (which previously had been owned), lapsed land
(which had been patented previously, but not settled within three
years), and escheat land (title to which had returned to the crown
when the holder died without heir or was convicted of felony).?

Nell Marion Nugent’s abstracts of patent books 9 through 14 are
reproduced photographically from the corrected page proofs. Arthur
Barnes, Joy Dickinson Barnes, Suzanne Smith Boyd, Lucille Gaines,
Patricia Vail Higgs, and Susan Oglesby indexed the text. Susan Bracey
Sheppard collated and photocopied their index cards to prepare
printer’s copy. Type for the index was set from, and proofread against,
the photocopied cards. Emily J. Salmon and Sandra Gioia Treadway
guided the index through the press. The library is deeply indebted to
the estate of Agnes Bernadine Sitterding for cooperation in bringing
this final fruit of her project into print.

venient accounts of the treasury right and the Northern Neck lands are in Fairfax
Harrison, Virginia Land Grants: A Study of Conveyancing in Relation to Colonial
Politics (Richmond, 1925). In 1948 the Land Office records were transferred from the
Capitol to the Archives Division of the Virginia State Library, and in 1952 the
General Assembly assigned the duties of the register of the Land Office to the
State Librarian. A guide to these records, and to finding aids for post-1732 and
Northern Neck land patents and grants, is Daphne S. Gentry, comp., Virginia
Land Office Inventory (Richmond, {1973}).

Honble. Hugh Drysdale, Esqr. WHERE-
AS William Hurt, eldest son & heir of
John Hurt, late of the Co, of King
William, hath humbly represented t6
this Board that his father in his lifetime
did take up & survey 400 acs. in St.
John’s Parish in sd. County & did return
a sutvey thereof into the Secretaries
Office & soon after departed this life,
whereby it hath happened that the
patent for the sd. land past in the name
of the said John Hurt some few days
after his decease; & for as much as the
sd, William Hurt hath this day made
application to the Governor that (for
avoiding all disputes which may arise
touching the said patent) he would be
pleased to accept a surrender of the
same & grant a new patent for sd. land
to him, to whom the inheritance thereof
would have descended in case the grant
thereof had been passed during the life
of his father. The Governor (with the
advice of the Council) is pleased to
order that the patent granted in the
name of the sd, John Hurt for 400
acres bearing date the 20 day of Feb.
last past & now surrendered be cancelled
& that a new patent for sd, land be
granted sd. William according to the
prayer of his petition. (Signed): Wil-
