INTRODUCTION

HE footnote to the introduction to volume three of Cavaliers
and Pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia Land Patents and
Grants described how Nell Marion Nugent’s first
volume, published in 1934, superseded her earlier
series of abstracts published in six numbers by the
Dietz Press, of Richmond, between 1929 and 1931. The note also stated
that “all information in the serial publication is found in vol. 1”! Shortly
after volume three had been published, the error of that statement was
brought to our attention. While examing copies of Mrs. Nugent’s
serial publication, we had failed to notice fourteen pages of abstracts of
Northern Neck Grants No. 1, 1690-1692.2 The abstracts are
photographically reproduced in this Supplement. The pages have been
renumbered, and Susan Bracey Sheppard prepared the index.

Researchers may also consult, in the archives reading room of the
Virginia State Library, an alphabetically arranged card index of grants
of Northern Neck land made between 1690 and 1874. Each of the 16,407
cards carries the name of the grantee, the date of the grant, information
about the location and acreage of the property, and references to the
manuscript record from which the information is taken. A more
detailed description of the Northern Neck land records held by the
Virginia State Library is in Daphne S. Gentry, comp., Virginia Land
Office Inventory (Richmond, [1973]), entries 9-24.
