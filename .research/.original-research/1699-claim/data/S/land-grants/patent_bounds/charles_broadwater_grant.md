## GIS Implementation Notes

### Historical Context
- Charles Broadwater was described as "a merchant mariner who made trips back and forth from England to Virginia" before settling in Virginia after marrying "the rich widow West in a fast-orbiting courtship" (per "All-American Crossroads")
- The document states: "Broadwater did not hold an original patent for land in the city of Falls Church, but he held a tract separated from John Trammell's land by Four Mile Run."
- Broadwater was an important figure in early Falls Church history, serving as a militia officer who rose to the rank of Colonel by the Revolutionary War
- He later became involved with the Pearson family when he married Thomas Pearson's widow, Anne Amelia Markham (1709-1796)
- While this grant was separate from Falls Church, Broadwater later lived "near Falls Church on the portion of the Pearson patent which became known as Broadwater's Quarter, a tract of 917 acres, which was nearly three-fourths of the Pearson patent." He leased this tract in 1763.

### GIS Mapping Considerations
- While precise metes and bounds are not available, the grant can be approximately placed using Four Mile Run as a key geographical feature
- The property was north of the run, with John Trammell's land to the south
- For more precise mapping, additional research in Northern Neck Grant Book or Land Office records may be necessary
