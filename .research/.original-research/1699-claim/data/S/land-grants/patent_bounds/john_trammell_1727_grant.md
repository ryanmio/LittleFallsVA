### Property Timeline
- **March 27, 1727:** John Trammell granted 185 acres (Northern Neck Grant Book B:55)
- **September 20, 1732:** Trammell sold the 185-acre tract to Samuel Johnson, mariner, of the City of London (Prince William Deeds A:355)

### Historical Context
- This was one of at least two significant land grants to John Trammell in the region
- The relatively quick sale of this property (within 5 years) to a London mariner suggests possible business connections to England
- The land later had connections to George Washington's family, as it was adjacent to land owned by "the heirs of Gen. George Washington"

### Geographic Significance
- The property's boundaries were later used as reference points for adjacent grants
- Records mention this property in relation to a "corner of Pearson's patent now a corner of Harvey Thompson and Fish's heirs"
- These boundary references can help establish the grant's location in relation to other known properties

This 1727 grant represents John Trammell's early land acquisitions in the region, though it appears he did not retain ownership for long. The grant's history suggests the dynamic nature of early colonial land transactions, including international connections.
