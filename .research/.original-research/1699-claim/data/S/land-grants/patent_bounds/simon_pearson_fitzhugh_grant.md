### Historical Significance
- This joint grant represents a business partnership between Simon Pearson and William Fitzhugh, who was one of the most influential landowners in Northern Virginia
- The grant is part of the early wave of Northern Neck patents issued in the 1720s that established European land ownership in what would become Fairfax County
- This partnership connected Pearson to the influential Fitzhugh family, one of Virginia's most prominent colonial dynasties

### Property Owners Background
- **Simon Pearson** (c. 1688-1733):
  - A prominent early Fairfax County planter and militia captain
  - Took out seven patents in the Falls Church area between 1724-1731
  - Related to George Washington's family through his second wife Hannah Ball (half-sister to Washington's mother)
  - His primary residence was in Stafford County, and later at Aquia Creek on the Potomac
  - Died relatively young in 1733

- **William Fitzhugh** (1674-1748):
  - Son of the immigrant William Fitzhugh of "Bedford"
  - Major landowner in Northern Virginia and one of the "great men" of colonial Virginia
  - Owned the massive "Ravensworth" tract of nearly 22,000 acres
  - Served on the Virginia House of Burgesses 
  - His residence was "Chatham" in Stafford County
  - A lawyer and militia commander
  - Married Ann Lee, sister of Thomas Lee of "Stratford"

### Related Grants and Family Connections
- This grant demonstrates how the Northern Neck aristocracy like Fitzhugh formed strategic alliances with up-and-coming planters like Pearson
- William Fitzhugh's main landholding was the enormous "Ravensworth" tract, which covered much of what is now Fairfax County between present-day Springfield and Vienna
- Fitzhugh's "Ravensworth" influenced smaller adjacent grants and settlement patterns 
- Simon Pearson also held several other grants in the area:
  - NN Grant #108 (his primary 1,200-acre Falls Church grant)
  - NN Grant #223 jointly with Thomas Going (652 acres)
  - NN Grant #272 jointly with Gabriel Adams Sr. (708 acres)
  - 660 acres along the road to Alexandria

### Later History
- After Simon Pearson's death in 1733, his share of this grant likely passed to his heirs
- The administration of his son Thomas Pearson's estate after 1744 may have included management of this property
- William Fitzhugh's share would have remained with the Fitzhugh family
- By the late 18th century, much of the Pearson family holdings had been sold off
- Detailed records of the subsequent division and ownership of this specific tract require further research
