### Historical Significance
- The property became known as "Cherry Hill" and represented a significant landholding in the heart of Falls Church
- Trammell was paid 320 pounds of tobacco for "grubbing a place for a church" (vestry minutes, October 13, 1734)
- The property later became the permanent location of The Falls Church (initially called the "Upper Church")
- This tract "included his home site, now known as 'Cherry Hill'" and was the center of Trammell's landholdings

### Family Connections
- John Trammell had a daughter Milkey (Milcah) Trammell who married Simon Pearson
- Likely related to Gerrard Trammell, who also held land in the area
- A 1749 tithables list shows John Trammell paying levies on six enslaved adults

### Additional Context
- Walter English was "a leaseholder to John Trammell" and was "a clerk of the new church (Falls Church) in 1743"
- Trammell and Harle were "directed to procession lands between Difficult and Broad runs in 1743"
- Trammell became a substantial landowner in the area, with this grant forming the core of his holdings

This grant is particularly significant for establishing the historical core of Falls Church, including the land that became the church property itself. The "Cherry Hill" property became a landmark in local history and helped define the early settlement patterns of the region.
