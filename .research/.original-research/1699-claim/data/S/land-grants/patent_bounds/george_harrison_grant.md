### Legal Context
- Walter English sued "Gerrard Trammell and George Harrison and won a judgment for 210 pounds and costs" (as noted in Trammell grant)
- Significant dispute with Michael Reagan resulted in division of the original tract

### Historical Significance
- Harrison "lived in Falls Church at the time of his death in 1748 and may have done so from the time of his grant in 1742"
- This grant represents one of the early established residences in Falls Church proper
- The property's later identity as "Winter Hill" and long-term ownership by the Wren family made it a significant local landmark

This grant is particularly valuable for tracing property transfers and settlement patterns in early Falls Church history, showing how land changed hands through inheritance, marriage, and sales.
