### Ownership Pattern
- Harle "never lived on this tract, but resided on property near Difficult Run"
- This represents a common pattern of non-resident land ownership in colonial Virginia
- After Harle's death, the property was purchased by Benjamin Sebastian

### Modern Geographic Context
- A portion of this tract corresponds to modern-day George Mason High School location
- This creates an important anchor point for mapping historical property boundaries
- The grant appears to have crossed current Falls Church city boundaries

### Connections to Other Grants
- John Harle had multiple properties, including this grant and land near Difficult Run
- John Trammell's property was adjacent to Harle's Difficult Run property (showing clustering of landholdings)
- The subsequent owner, Benjamin Sebastian, was also involved in property disputes with Gerrard Trammell's tenant (Thomas Moxley)

This grant is notable for establishing a clear connection to modern geography (George Mason High School), making it valuable for anchoring historical maps to present-day landmarks.
