## GIS Implementation Notes
The document mentions "Gunnell received three grants in 1729. Two were partially in the city of Falls Church. (NN grants 184, 185)." This is one of the two grants partially within Falls Church. One reference states William Jr. was given "the four hundred acre tract on which William, Sr. lived" - this might refer to this grant or a combination of his grants.
