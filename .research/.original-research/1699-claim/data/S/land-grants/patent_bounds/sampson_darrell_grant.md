### Timeline of Occupation
- **1692:** Sampson Darrell made reference to his "frontier plantation at Pimmit's (Run)" in this year
- **1715:** Formal grant recorded (23 years after initial occupation)
- **1743:** The Truro Parish Vestry ordered Sampson Darrell to perform some duty (exact nature not specified in available sources)

### Historical Context
- Darrell's reference to his "frontier plantation" in 1692 indicates this was one of the earliest European settlements in the region
- This grant represents a common pattern where occupation preceded formal land registration by many years
- The significant gap (23 years) between occupation and formal grant registration demonstrates the frontier nature of the area in the late 17th century

### Legal Records
- Sampson Darrell appears in Stafford Court records (date not specified)
- In 1707, he was a defendant in a legal case
- A deed exists from "Nowland and Darrell to Sampson Darrell" (possibly a family transaction)
- Darrell also held land in trust for Anne Slaughter (relationship not specified)

This grant is particularly significant as it represents one of the earliest documented European settlements in the region, predating most other grants in the area by decades. The "frontier" designation in 1692 provides important context for understanding early colonial expansion into what would later become Fairfax County.
