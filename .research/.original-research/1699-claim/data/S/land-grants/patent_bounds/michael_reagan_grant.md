### Property History
- "Reagan's land at Falls Church was farmed by a tenant. He lived further out in the county near Goose Creek."
- Thomas Grafford kept an ordinary (tavern) on a tract owned by Michael Reagan near the Falls Church
- Reagan donated land for the original Falls Church but failed to give a formal deed to the Vestry
- By 1746, Reagan had sold his property to John Trammell, who later deeded two acres to the Vestry

### Land Disputes and Division
- Reagan was involved in a land dispute with George Harrison
- On August 16, 1748, after Harrison's death, Reagan was awarded 107 acres (half of Harrison's tract)
- This additional property was described as "107 acres on the main road Alexandria"

### Family and Inheritance
- After Michael Reagan's death in 1773, the property was left to his daughters Constant and Mildred
- When Constant died childless in 1778, her brother Nicholas (then living in Berkeley County, Virginia) sold the Falls Church property to John Carlyle for three hundred pounds

### Historical Context
- Michael Reagan was a "papist" (Catholic), which was noted as unusual since "Non-conformists were" generally not as common in the area
- Records mention Michael Reagan "having orphans bound to him to learn the" trade (apprentices)
- Reagan voted in elections in 1748, 1765, and 1768
- The area was initially identified in colonial records as the "Crossroads near Michael Reagan's Plantation"
- A 1733 agreement records Richard Blackburn's contract "to build a church at the crossroads near Michael Reagans"

This grant is historically significant as it establishes one of the earliest European settlements in what would become Falls Church, and the site of the original church that gave the community its name.
