### Property Management
- Thomas Moxley was "a tenant for Gerrard Trammell, whose tract adjoined Sebastian's property"
- This indicates Trammell was wealthy enough to lease portions of his land to tenants
- The presence of "one hundred oak trees" on the property (mentioned in lawsuit) suggests significant timber resources

### Legal Disputes
- Sebastian sued Moxley (Trammell's tenant) on different occasions, accusing him "of trespass and having cut down one hundred oak trees"
- Walter English sued "Gerrard Trammell and George Harrison and won a judgment for 210 pounds and costs"
  - The substantial sum (210 pounds) indicates a significant dispute
  - Joint lawsuit with George Harrison suggests possible business partnership or adjacent properties

### Family Connections
- Gerrard Trammell appears to be separate from John Trammell, though likely related
- The presence of multiple Trammells in land records suggests a family with significant landholdings in the region

This grant is particularly notable for establishing contextual information about property disputes and tenant farming practices in colonial Falls Church.
