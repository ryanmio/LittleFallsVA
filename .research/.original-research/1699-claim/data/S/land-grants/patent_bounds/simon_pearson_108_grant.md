## Survey Notes
- **Surveyors:** Mr. John Savage (initial survey of April 15, 1724) and W. Savage (returned survey of April 14, 1728)
- **Original begin point:** Marked White Oak standing on the west side of Holmes Run
- **Units:** Distances in poles/perches (1 perch = 16.5 feet)
- **Features:** The survey mentions both Holmes Run and Pimmit Run as boundaries
- **Remarkable Element:** There is a discrepancy between the metes and bounds in the grant document and the actual survey plat table, suggesting either 1) the survey was adjusted before patenting or 2) these represent different surveys of the same tract

## GIS Implementation Notes

### Technical Notes for Digitization
- When digitizing this tract, the full 20-point survey table from the original plat should be used rather than the 9-point description in the grant
- The survey suggests a more complex, irregular shape than the simplified description in the grant
- Natural features like "Holness's Runn" (modern Holmes Run) and "punnitts Runn" (Pimmit Run) are labeled on the plat and can be used for georeferencing
- The acreage is confirmed as 1,279 acres in both the grant and survey

### Historical Significance
- This is "the first recorded grant within the City of Falls Church"
- Establishes 1724 as the earliest documented European claim to land within present-day Falls Church boundaries
- The grant included the western half of the City of Falls Church and extended two miles westward
- The site later became the location of The Falls Church itself (built 1733 just east of Pearson's house site)

### Property Owner Background
- Simon Pearson (c.1688-1733) was a prominent early Fairfax County planter and militia captain
- Pearson was related to George Washington's family (his second wife was Hannah Ball, half-sister to Washington's mother)
- Pearson took out seven patents in the Falls Church area between 1724-1731
- Although he acquired the Falls Church land in 1724, Pearson's primary residence remained in Stafford County
- Pearson established a small plantation or hunting lodge on this tract in the 1720s
- Within a few years, Pearson moved his base to a Potomac River plantation at Aquia Creek
- He left the Falls Church grant in the hands of family and overseers
- He died relatively young in 1733

### Related Grants and Family Connections
- Held NN Grant #223 jointly with Thomas Going (652 acres within two miles of Falls Church)
- Held NN Grant #272 jointly with Gabriel Adams Sr., his uncle by marriage (708 acres)
- Held NN Grant #137 jointly with William Fitzhugh (1409 acres)
- Held grants for 660 acres along the road to Alexandria
- A tobacco warehouse was built in 1732 on Pearson's land on the upper side of Hunting Creek

### Inheritance History
- **1733:** Upon Simon Pearson's death, his heirs assumed control of the Falls Church tract. His only son Thomas Pearson (c.1712-1744) and daughters Margaret and Susannah all inherited portions of the land.
- **1744:** Thomas Pearson died at about 32 years old, leaving the Falls Church lands to his infant son, Simon Pearson (born c.1737).
- Thomas's widow, Anne Amelia Pearson (née Markham), remarried to Colonel Charles Broadwater Jr.
- Because young Simon Pearson was underage, the court appointed guardians to manage his inheritance - first William Henry Terrett, and by 1758 Col. Charles Broadwater (his stepfather).

### Leases and Divisions
- **Mid-18th Century:** Portions of the Pearson land were leased to tenants for farming. By the 1750s, John Hurst had leased sections of the Pearson tract.
- **1758:** During Simon Pearson the younger's ill-fated first marriage (to Milcah "Milkey" Trammell), Broadwater's records note building a frame house for Simon on the property.
- **1759:** Simon Pearson granted Peletiah Grafford and their infant son a portion of the Falls Church tract as a gift.
- **1763:** Under Broadwater's stewardship, a large part of the original grant (917 acres, nearly three-quarters of the entire grant) was set aside as "Broadwater's Quarter."
- **1760s-1790s:** Simon Pearson gradually sold off or lost much of his inheritance. By the time of his death in 1797, many tracts had been sold and were owned by others, including George Washington, Charles Broadwater, and John Hurst.
- **c.1789:** Simon Pearson, having no legitimate surviving children, willed his remaining property to his brother, Thomas Pearson Jr., who had moved to Kentucky.

### Indigenous Context
- The reference to an "Indian poison field" as a boundary marker provides rare documentation of indigenous land use
- This indigenous placename on the 1724 deed suggests continued native presence or at least memory of native land use
- Colonial observers named areas deliberately burned out by Native Americans to aid in hunting as "poison fields" - early settlers mistakenly thought the Indians had "poisoned" the soil, due to the absence of mature trees on such cleared land

This grant is particularly significant as the earliest documented European land claim within present-day Falls Church. It represents the genesis of European landownership in Falls Church City and set the stage for early settlement at The Falls Church. Its legacy endured through the various farms (Broadwater's Quarter, Winter Hill, etc.) that later occupied the same ground.
