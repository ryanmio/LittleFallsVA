# Northern Virginia Land Grants (1660-1730)

This summary provides an overview of land grants in Northern Virginia counties.

## Data Extraction Process

The data was extracted from the OCR'd text of 'Cavaliers and Pioneers' by Nell Marion Nugent, which contains abstracts of Virginia Land Patents and Grants from 1623-1800. The extraction focused on Northern Virginia counties including Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford, Westmoreland, Northumberland, Lancaster, Richmond, King George, Arlington, and Alexandria.

## Source Limitations

**Important Note**: After analysis, we've determined that the OCR'd text we processed primarily contains Volume I of Nugent's compilation, which covers the period from 1623 to approximately 1666. This explains the overwhelming concentration of grants in the 1660s and the paucity of entries after 1700.

Volume I does not include many of the Northern Neck Proprietary grants that would be most relevant for our research on early 18th century Falls Church area settlement. Those grants would appear in Volumes II and III, which we currently don't have in OCR'd form.

## Data Quality Notes

- This data is based on OCR'd text and may contain errors or omissions.
- Some grants may be missing county information and thus not included in this analysis.
- The Northern Neck Proprietary grants (Lord Fairfax) are severely underrepresented in this dataset due to the volume limitation.
- There may be issues with OCR quality in the source text.

## Research Implications

The significant gap in data for the period 1670-1730 means that this dataset alone is insufficient for analyzing the historical plausibility of settlement in the Falls Church area circa 1699. To address this limitation, we should:

1. Obtain OCR'd versions of Volumes II and III of Nugent's compilation
2. Access the Northern Neck Grant Books directly from the Library of Virginia
3. Seek county-specific historical records for Fairfax, Prince William, and Stafford counties

The current data does provide a baseline for understanding the earlier land settlement patterns in Northern Virginia, particularly along the Northern Neck peninsula (Lancaster, Northumberland, Westmoreland) in the 1660s, which preceded the inland settlement push toward what is now Falls Church.
