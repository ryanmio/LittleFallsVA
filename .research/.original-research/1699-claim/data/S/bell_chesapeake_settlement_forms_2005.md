notes: |
  Bell synthesises archaeological data on English immigrant settlement in the 17th‑century Chesapeake, highlighting three principal residential forms (p. 449):
    • nucleated villages (≈ 12–50 households)
    • hamlets and small clusters
    • single dispersed farmsteads
  
  Key observations relevant to Factor S (existence of a *long‑lasting* structure built 1669‑1729):
  1. Even the dispersed farmsteads typically contained *several* buildings (house, kitchens, slave quarters, sheds).  True one‑building outposts are not emphasised.
  2. Village nuclei were common enough that a solitary cabin set well apart from neighbours would have been the minority pattern, though not impossible.
  3. Bell notes that by the late 17th c. planters "scattered widely to claim the maximum amount of land on which to grow tobacco" yet still managed land "through inter‑household decisions" (p. 449), implying at least loose clustering.
  4. Taken together, archaeology indicates habitation over almost the entire Tidewater by 1690s, but a *permanent* standalone log cabin (vs. earth‑fast or cluster) is less than the modal case.
  
  Hyperprior rationale:
  – We retain the project's working prior for S, Beta(6,4), mean = 0.6, because Bell's synthesis neither drastically raises nor lowers the probability that *some* long‑lasting structure existed near Falls Church by 1699.  
  – The file serves to *contextualise* that prior: the most plausible embodiment of S is a house within a small cluster rather than a lone cabin.
  
  Limitations & transferability:
  – Falls Church is upriver and slightly inland relative to most sites Bell references, but still in the broader Chesapeake cultural sphere.
  – Bell's focus is social/economic patterning; she does not date individual structures in northern Virginia specifically.

### Summary

Bell's review of 17th‑century Chesapeake settlement reveals that English colonists usually organised residence in small villages or hamlets containing multiple households, though some single farmsteads existed.  Genuine "one‑cabin" outposts were exceptional.  This nuance tempers the mental image of an isolated Falls Church log cabin: while a durable dwelling could have been built in 1699, archaeological expectation favours a small cluster of structures.  The evidence therefore supports keeping Factor S's prior at roughly 0.6 but cautions against assuming an isolated cabin was the normative form.
