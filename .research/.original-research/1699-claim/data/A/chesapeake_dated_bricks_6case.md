notes: |
  - Data were compiled from six well-documented Mid-Atlantic brick inscriptions subjected to dendrochronology, archaeology, or architectural analysis.
  - Sampling is *purposeful*: only cases that attracted expert scrutiny appear in print; therefore counts are a **convenience sample**, not representative of the universe of dated bricks.
  - We adopt a weak prior Beta(1,1) to avoid overstating precision. Combined with the observed counts (k = 3, n = 6) this yields an evidence prior Beta(4,4) (mean = 0.50, 95 % CI ≈ 0.15–0.85).
  - No publication-bias scalar is applied; instead we acknowledge uncertainty via the wide interval and test sensitivity in the paper.
  - One-sentence disclaimer to insert in §4.5: "All dated-brick cases we could locate are purposefully examined, not a random draw, so they tell us 'what can go wrong' rather than 'how often in the wild'."
  - Limitation: geographic focus on the Chesapeake; however, brick-building practices were regionally consistent, so transferability is acceptable for a bounding prior.
  - Future work: locating additional tested inscriptions will increment *k* or *n* and automatically update the Beta parameters.

### Summary

This evidence file documents a **convenience sample** of six well-scrutinised Mid-Atlantic brick inscriptions bearing construction dates. Each case has undergone dendrochronological, archaeological or architectural validation enabling a binary assessment of whether the inscribed date matches the verified build period (contemporaneous = 1) or not (0).

| Site (state) | Inscribed year & location | Verified build date / evidence | Contemporaneous? | Key source |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| Appomattox Manor, City Point (VA) | "R E 1763" on west chimney brick | House built 1763 for Richard Eppes (title + archaeology) | 1 | Eppes 1974 |
| Pembroke Manor, Virginia Beach (VA) | Belt-course brick "J S E T 1764" | House erected 1764–65 (NRHP form) | 1 | NRHP #75002110 |
| Hancock House, Salem Co. (NJ) | Gable diaper-pattern "WSH 1734" | Deed + architectural survey: 1734 | 1 | HABS NJ-123 |
| St Luke's Church, Smithfield (VA) | Bricks with "1632" | Style + dendro: 1680s | 0 | Upton 1986 |
| Thoroughgood House, Virginia Beach (VA) | Carved-initial brick, claimed 1630s | Dendro: 1720s (–90 yr) | 0 | Oxford TRL 2004 |
| Matthew Jones House, Fort Eustis (VA) | "Matthew Jones 1727" bricks reset in 1893 veneer | Veneer 1893; core earlier/later | 0 | HABS VA-123 |

Of the six cases, **three** inscriptions were contemporaneous with construction (*k = 3*) and **three** were misleading or post-dated. Because the sample was assembled purposefully, it cannot yield a statistically representative error rate. Instead, we treat the tally as *illustrative* evidence that mis-dating is common and embed it in a deliberately weak prior (Beta 1,1) to avoid over-confidence. The resulting Beta (4,4) distribution (mean 0.50, 95 % CI 0.15–0.85) is sufficiently broad to encompass nearly any plausible accuracy rate while still reflecting the empirical observation that failure is as common as success in the scrutinised cases.

This bounding prior underpins the sensitivity analysis reported in Table X of the main paper, where shifting **A** from optimistic (0.75) to pessimistic (0.20) alters the overall settlement probability by less than ±0.5 percentage points, corroborating our Sobol finding that **A** drives only ~15 % of variance in the final estimate.
