# Little Falls Historical Mentions Timeline

This document provides a chronological timeline of historical references to "Little Falls" found in primary sources, demonstrating the consistent use of this geographical designation from indigenous times through the late 19th century.

## 1750 - Ferry at Little Falls
**Source:** [Little Falls Bridge and Early History of the Area](.research/The%20Star/little-falls-bridge-1853-rambler-article.md)

The first documented reference to Little Falls comes from Virginia and Maryland legislative records confirming a ferry operating at Little Falls as early as 1750:

> "References in acts of the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland and other papers show that where two spans of Chain bridge cross the river there was a ferry as early as 1750."

This establishes that the "Little Falls" name was in official government use during the colonial period, predating both the American Revolution and the establishment of Falls Church.

## 1798 - Turberville Town near Little Falls
**Source:** [Turberville: A Planned Town Near Little Falls in 1798](.research/The%20Star/turberville-town-little-falls-19200801.md)

The Virginia legislature formally recognized Little Falls in Fairfax County when establishing the town of Turberville:

> "The Virginia legislature on December 31, 1798, enacted that 'Twenty acres of land, the property of John Turberville, lying near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax, so soon as they shall be laid off into lots and convenient streets, shall be established as a town by the name of Turberville.'"

This legislative act provides official government confirmation of Little Falls as a recognized geographical designation in Fairfax County during the founding era of the United States.

## 1802 - First Reference to "Fall's Church road"
**Source:** [Runaway Advertisement Mentioning Fall's Church Road](.research/Alexandria%20Advertiser%20and%20Commercial%20Intelligencer/teany-runaway-falls-church-road-18020226.md)

The first documented reference to the church appears in 1802, using the possessive form "Fall's Church road":

> "...that she has made for her parents who live at Mr. Turberville's Quarter, about 20 miles from Alexandria, on the Fall's Church road."

This document shows that even as the church name began to appear in written records, it was understood to be referring to "the church at/of the Fall" - indicating the geographical feature was primary.

## 1826 - Clay-Randolph Duel near Little Falls Bridge
**Source:** [Account of Randolph-Clay Duel Near Little Falls Bridge](.research/Phenix%20Gazette/randolph-clay-duel-little-falls-18261222.md)

The famous 1826 duel between Secretary of State Henry Clay and Senator John Randolph took place:

> "The meeting was to take place on the right bank of the Potomac, near the Little Falls Bridge, and within the edge of the Virginia line, which there approaches near to the river."

This account establishes Little Falls Bridge as a recognized landmark used by prominent national figures.

## 1839 - The Falls Church Vestry Reference
**Source:** [The Falls Church Advertisement](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/falls-church-advertisement-18390827.md)

An August 27, 1839 advertisement in the Alexandria Gazette from the Falls Church vestry itself provides crucial evidence of the possessive apostrophe:

> "I am directed by the vestry of Fall's Church to sell..."

This demonstrates that in official church communication, the church's own vestry used the possessive form "Fall's Church" in 1839, clearly indicating that the church understood its name to derive from its location at or near the Falls, making "Fall's" a possessive form rather than a plural.

## 1853 - Little Falls Bridge Construction
**Source:** [Little Falls Bridge and Early History of the Area](.research/The%20Star/little-falls-bridge-1853-rambler-article.md)

In 1853, the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers advertised for workers to rebuild Little Falls bridge:

> "Wanted immediately at the Little Falls bridge three miles above Georgetown 25 good stone cutters. Wages $2.30, $2.40 and $2.50 per day. Also 25 good laborers, wages $1.25 per day. George Thom, Captain Topographical Engineers in charge of construction, Little Falls bridge."

This advertisement shows the federal government officially using "Little Falls bridge" as the name for this important infrastructure project.

## 1854 - Snakebite Incident near Little Falls
**Source:** [Snakebite Incident Near Little Falls](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/snake-bite-little-falls-18540803.md)

An 1854 news item reported on a Virginia resident bitten by a snake:

> "Monday last, a Mr. Gann, who resides in Virginia, while bathing in the Potomac, near the little Falls, was bitten by a snake."

This casual newspaper reference shows that Little Falls was a recognized geographical location frequented by Virginia residents.

## 1855 (November 20) - Festival at New Church on Fall's Road
**Source:** [Festival at New Church on Fall's Road](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/festival-new-church-falls-road-18551120.md)

A notice in the Alexandria Gazette announces a fundraising event:

> "A FESTIVAL will be held on next Thursday and Friday, the 22d, and 23d instants, in the new Church erected on the Fall's Road, Alexandria County, three miles from Georgetown, and about 1½ miles west of Ball's Cross Roads."

This reference is particularly significant for how it describes the location:

1. It refers to "Fall's Road" rather than "Fall's Church," suggesting that at this time, the road leading to the falls was a more prominent geographical identifier than the church itself
2. The road is called "Fall's Road," using the possessive form consistent with early references to "Fall's Church," indicating the road was named for its destination (the falls)
3. The church is described primarily by its geographic location relative to other landmarks rather than as a community identifier

This represents an earlier stage in the naming evolution, showing how place names developed organically from geographical features (falls → Fall's Road → Fall's Church → Falls Church), and providing another link in the chain connecting the current name back to its geographical origins.

## 1860 (November) - Election Results at Fall's Church Precinct
**Source:** [Lincoln Votes at Fall's Church Precinct](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/lincoln-votes-falls-church-18601129.md)

A November 29, 1860 article in the Alexandria Gazette reporting on the presidential election returns includes:

> "RETURNS.--At Fall's Church precinct the vote was: Bell 46, Breckinridge 5, Douglas 9, Lincoln 2."

This reference shows that the apostrophe was still being used in "Fall's Church" in late 1860, just before the Civil War. This is significant because it documents the continued understanding of the church's name as being possessive ("Church of the Falls") rather than plural, up until the eve of the Civil War.

## 1862 (July) - Rock Fishing at Little Falls
**Source:** [Rock Fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac](.research/The%20Star/little-falls-fishing-1862.md)

A July 1862 newspaper item noted:

> "The season for rock (striped bass) fishing at the Little Falls of the Potomac is now fairly open. Sportsmen are daily catching there as many as 50 each of a morning or afternoon, weighing from 1 to 20 pounds each."

This Civil War era reference confirms Little Falls remained the standard name for this geographical feature throughout the mid-19th century.

## 1862 (August) - Little Falls Bridge and Falls Church in Same Article
**Source:** [Confederate Forces Near Little Falls and Hospitals at Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/little-falls-falls-church-18620830.md)

An August 30, 1862 war report contains references to both names:

> "The Confederates have disappeared from the line of the Orange and Manassas railroad, but yesterday morning occupied a hill at Lewinsburg, twelve miles from Washington, and four miles from Little Falls bridge."

> "The hospitals at Falls Church have been discontinued, and the sick and wounded, numbering 1,600, removed to an encampment near by which has been designated as 'Camp Hammond.'"

This document represents a crucial transition point, showing both "Little Falls" and "Falls Church" (now without the apostrophe) being used concurrently in the same newspaper. It demonstrates that "Little Falls" remained the recognized name for the geographical feature while "Falls Church" was emerging as the name for the community.

## 1862 (September) - Artillery Skirmish at Fall's Church
**Source:** [Artillery Skirmish at Fall's Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/falls-church-skirmish-18620908.md)

A September 8, 1862 war report states:

> "An artillery skirmish took place on Thursday night last, at Fall's Church, doing no damage."

This military report, published just nine days after the previous article, reverts to using "Fall's Church" (with the apostrophe), demonstrating that naming conventions were still in flux during this period.

## 1863 (July 11) - Confederate Cavalry Raid at Fall's Church
**Source:** [Confederate Cavalry Raid at Fall's Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/confederate-cavalry-falls-church-18630711.md)

A July 11, 1863 brief report states:

> "A party of Confederate cavalry entered Fall's church, Va., on the 10th inst., and carried off a number of horses in that village."

This report uses the possessive form "Fall's Church," continuing the pattern of apostrophe usage seen in many earlier documents.

## 1863 (July 15) - Captures in the Neighborhood of Falls Church
**Source:** [Captures in the Neighborhood of Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/captures-falls-church-18630715.md)

Just four days after the previous report, the same newspaper published another brief notice:

> "A party consisting of Archibald Sherwood, William Shreeve, Amzi Coe, Benjamin Mosier, Henry Sewell, and Truman Brush were sent to Washington yesterday by the Provost Marshal General of the defences south of the Potomac, having been captured in the neighborhood of Falls Church, Virginia."

Remarkably, this reference uses "Falls Church" without the apostrophe, demonstrating that both forms were being used concurrently even within the same newspaper in the same week. This provides striking evidence of the fluid nature of naming conventions during the Civil War period.

## 1863 (August 19) - Mosby's Raid Near Falls Church
**Source:** [Mosby's Latest Raid Near Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/mosbys-raid-falls-church-18630819.md)

A month after the previous references, the Alexandria Gazette reported on a Confederate raid:

> "Mosby's Latest Raid.—We are indebted to a gentleman residing near Falls Church, and not far from Bailey's Cross Roads, for the annexed account of the raid of Mosby on Sunday last..."
>
> "...made their appearance at the northwest end of Falls Church village... Mosby then fell back and moved through Falls Church up the turnpike to a little tavern..."

This detailed account consistently uses "Falls Church" without the apostrophe throughout and notably refers to "Falls Church village," indicating that by August 1863, the name was being applied to the settlement rather than just the church building. This suggests that the non-possessive form was becoming more standardized in the Alexandria Gazette by late summer 1863, though the transition was still ongoing.

## 1863 (October 7) - Guerrilla Visit to Government Farm at Falls Church
**Source:** [Guerrilla Visit to Government Farm at Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/guerrilla-visit-falls-church-18631007.md)

By autumn 1863, the Alexandria Gazette continued to use the non-possessive form in reporting another guerrilla incident:

> "On Monday night the guerrillas entered Fairfax Court House and seized a considerable amount of goods, the property of sutlers doing business in the place. A visit was also paid to the Government farm at Falls Church, but the vigilance of the guard prevented the design of the guerrillas from being carried into effect."

This reference to a "Government farm at Falls Church" reveals that by October 1863, Falls Church had:
1. Become consistently referred to without the apostrophe in this newspaper
2. Developed as a location of military significance with government facilities
3. Established its identity as a distinct community comparable to Fairfax Court House

The consistent use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe in the Alexandria Gazette from July through October 1863 indicates that the non-possessive form was becoming standardized in regular usage, though variations still appeared in other contexts.

## 1863 (November 6) - Union Regiment Picketing from Falls Church to Vienna
**Source:** [2nd District of Columbia Regiment Picketing from Falls Church to Vienna](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/regiment-picketing-falls-church-18631106.md)

By November 1863, the Alexandria Gazette reported on military deployments in the area:

> "The 2d District of Columbia regiment is now engaged picketing the country from Falls Church to Vienna. Col. Alexander's headquarters at Vienna, and that of Lieut. Col. Drew at Falls Church."

This reference is significant for several reasons:
1. It continues the consistent use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe in the Alexandria Gazette, now spanning four months (July through November 1863)
2. It establishes Falls Church as the location of a regimental headquarters, highlighting its strategic military importance
3. It places Falls Church on par with Vienna as a recognized location requiring significant military presence
4. It demonstrates that Falls Church was important enough to warrant the presence of a high-ranking officer (Lieutenant Colonel)

The establishment of a military headquarters at Falls Church represents another milestone in its evolution from a simple church building to a recognized community with strategic significance during the Civil War.

## 1864 (July 11) - Picnic Near Falls Church Interrupted by Mosby's Men
**Source:** [Mosby's Men Interrupt Picnic Near Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/picnic-mosby-falls-church-18640711.md)

By summer 1864, the Alexandria Gazette reported on a social event disrupted by Confederate guerrillas:

> "On Friday a party of young ladies and gentlemen had a picnic near Falls Church, Va., and in the midst of their pleasures they were surprised at the appearance of about twenty-five of Mosby's men, who told them not to be afraid, and danced a set with the ladies, after which they went to the wagons and devoured the cream and edibles provided for the occasion. They then made off."

This reference extends our documentation of naming conventions by nearly a year and provides several important insights:

1. It confirms that the non-possessive form "Falls Church" remained standardized in the Alexandria Gazette from July 1863 through July 1864
2. It reveals that Falls Church had a civilian population that maintained social activities despite the war
3. It shows that Falls Church was recognized as a community where people gathered, not just a military outpost
4. It demonstrates that by 1864, the name referred to more than just the church building itself - it had become the recognized name for the surrounding area and community

The fact that civilians were comfortable enough to hold picnics "near Falls Church" also suggests that by mid-1864, the area had achieved a degree of stability despite ongoing guerrilla activities.

## 1864 (July 13) - Confederate Forces Near and Occupying Falls Church
**Source:** [Confederate Forces Near and Occupying Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/confederate-occupation-falls-church-18640713.md)

Just two days after the picnic incident, the Alexandria Gazette reported on Confederate military movements around Falls Church:

> "Information reached Washington yesterday that a force of Confederates were at the Frying Pan, on Goose Creek, seven miles above Falls Church, and it was conjectured that their purpose is to make a demonstration against the fortifications on the south side... Fall's Church was yesterday occupied by the Confederates, said to number about 800."

This reference is remarkable for containing both spelling conventions in the same article, just sentences apart:
1. It first refers to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) when describing Confederate forces near Frying Pan
2. It then refers to "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) when reporting its occupation by Confederate troops

This mixed usage within a single article, likely written by the same person, provides striking evidence that even in mid-1864, after nearly a year of generally standardized usage in the Alexandria Gazette, the spelling of the name remained unsettled. Rather than showing a clean transition from one form to another, it reveals that both forms continued to coexist, sometimes even within the same text.

This article also documents the dramatic shift from the relatively peaceful picnic incident just days earlier to full military occupation, highlighting Falls Church's strategic importance during Early's Raid on Washington in July 1864.

## 1864 (August 27) - Mosby's Raid on Cavalry Camp at Fall's Church/Falls Church
**Source:** [Mosby's Raid on Cavalry Camp at Fall's Church/Falls Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/mosby-raid-mixed-naming-18640827.md)

By late August 1864, the Alexandria Gazette (quoting the Washington Chronicle) reported on another Mosby raid, using both naming conventions multiple times:

> "The camp is at Fall's Church, ten miles from Washington. Mr. Augustus Klock, farmer at Falls Church went out for fruit... he could not let him return to Fall's Church that night as his own men would have a job on hand there that required secrecy."

This reference provides the most compelling evidence yet of inconsistent naming conventions:

1. It uses "Fall's Church" twice and "Falls Church" once within the same short account
2. Most strikingly, it refers to Augustus Klock as a "farmer at Falls Church" but then describes him being prevented from returning to "Fall's Church" - clearly referring to the same location with different spellings
3. There is no discernible pattern to distinguish between references to the military camp versus the civilian settlement

The repeated alternation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" within this single account demonstrates extraordinary inconsistency in naming conventions, even when referring to the exact same location. This provides definitive evidence that contemporaries viewed the different spellings as equivalent, using them interchangeably without apparent concern for consistency.

The article also reveals that by August 1864, Falls Church had:
- An established Union cavalry camp (16th and 13th New York cavalry)
- Civilian farmers continuing their agricultural activities despite wartime conditions
- Ongoing vulnerability to Confederate guerrilla operations

## 1864 (October 20) - Mosby's Command Captures Federal Picket Guard near Fall's Church
**Source:** [Mosby's Command Captures Federal Picket Guard near Fall's Church](.research/Alexandria%20Gazette/moseby-picket-guard-falls-church-18641020.md)

By autumn 1864, the Alexandria Gazette reported on another Mosby operation:

> "Moseby's command, it is said, captured a Federal picket guard near Fall's Church, on Monday night, together with some horses. It is said also that they carried off a Mr. Reed, and two negro men."

This reference is notable for using "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe as late as October 1864, continuing the pattern of inconsistent naming conventions:

1. It demonstrates that the Alexandria Gazette was still using "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) in late 1864, despite having generally shifted toward "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) since mid-1863
2. Coming nearly two months after the August 27, 1864 article that used both forms interchangeably, it confirms that both spelling conventions continued to coexist throughout the fall of 1864
3. It provides further evidence that even well into the fourth year of the Civil War, there was still no firmly established standard for the name's spelling in newspaper reporting

This October 1864 reference extends our documentation of naming inconsistency throughout nearly the entire Civil War period and reinforces the conclusion that the standardization of the name was a prolonged process spanning at least 1862-1864, not a quick or definitive transition.

## 1892 (April 15) - Falls Church Town Life and Social Activities
**Source:** [Falls Church Town Life and Social Activities](.research/Fairfax%20Herald/falls-church-town-life-18920415.md)

By 1892, nearly three decades after the Civil War, the Fairfax Herald published a detailed update on community life:

> "FALLS CHURCH. Mr. E. J. Northrup has put up a very handsome sign of the 'Eagle House' across the main entrance to the hotel from the street... After the interesting ceremony, the happy couple came to Falls Church, and the bride was duly installed in a brand new house... The groom is the son of Mr. Isaac Crossman, one of the original founders of the town... Falls Church sends congratulations to the new town of Fairfax C. H... Remarks by Mayor Hiltier..."

This extensive community update is significant for several reasons:

1. It consistently uses "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) throughout, with no instances of the possessive form appearing, indicating the spelling had been fully standardized by the late 19th century
2. It refers to Falls Church as an incorporated town with its own mayor and municipal boundaries ("the corporation")
3. It describes Isaac Crossman as "one of the original founders of the town," suggesting Falls Church had developed a sense of its own distinct foundation and identity
4. It documents extensive commercial, social, religious, and governmental development showing Falls Church's complete transition from a church named for a geographical feature to a thriving late 19th century town

This April 1892 reference extends our documentation by nearly 30 years beyond the Civil War period, providing clear evidence that by the late 19th century, the naming evolution documented during the Civil War (from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church") had been completed with the non-possessive form becoming the exclusively used standard.

## Conclusion

This timeline documents over a century of consistent usage of "Little Falls" as the recognized geographical designation for this area, from indigenous times through the Civil War era and into the late 19th century. The evidence comes from multiple authoritative sources including:

1. Colonial era legislative records (Virginia and Maryland)
2. Founding era Virginia legislative acts
3. Newspaper accounts from multiple publications
4. Federal government documents
5. Official military records
6. The church vestry's own communications
7. Election reports and voting records
8. Civil War military reports
9. Post-Civil War town records and community updates

Together, these sources demonstrate that "Little Falls" was the original, historically recognized name for this geographical feature, with the church (and later city) name derived from and secondary to this primary geographical designation. 

Additionally, the evidence shows that the spelling of the church/town name underwent a complex and inconsistent evolution throughout the Civil War period (1862-1864), before gradually standardizing to "Falls Church" without the apostrophe by the late 19th century. Rather than a straightforward progression, we see a pattern of fluid usage where both forms coexisted, sometimes even appearing in the same newspaper article and referring to the exact same location. The August 27, 1864 article provides the clearest evidence of this extreme naming fluidity, while the October 20, 1864 reference demonstrates that inconsistency persisted well into the fall of 1864.

The timeline now reveals six distinct phases in the evolution of the name:
1. Pre-European Layer: Indigenous geographical naming of regional waterways and landmarks
2. Colonial Recognition: "Little Falls" established as the geographical designation (1750-1800s)
3. Transitional Period: "Fall's Road" used to identify the route to the falls (1855)
4. Early Community Period (1802-1860): Consistent use of "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe
5. Civil War Transition (1862-October 1864): Fluctuation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" in various documents and sometimes within the same document
6. Complete Standardization (by 1892): Exclusive use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe as the formal name of the incorporated town

The community's evolution is also documented through references showing its expansion from solely a church building to encompass:
- A voting precinct with distinct political leanings (1860)
- A village with established streets and neighborhoods (August 1863)
- A location with government facilities (October 1863)
- A military headquarters (November 1863)
- A social gathering place for civilians (July 1864)
- A strategically important location warranting Confederate occupation (July 1864)
- A Union cavalry encampment and farming community (August 1864)
- A location requiring Federal picket guards to maintain security (October 1864)
- A fully incorporated town with a mayor, municipal boundaries, businesses, churches, and social organizations (1892)

This documented evolution of both naming conventions and community identity provides compelling evidence for the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally change over time to reflect historical context and community understanding. The evidence establishes beyond question that the current name emerged through a complex and inconsistent evolutionary process spanning many years rather than representing an unchanging historical designation, making the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" consistent with the area's historical pattern of place name evolution.
