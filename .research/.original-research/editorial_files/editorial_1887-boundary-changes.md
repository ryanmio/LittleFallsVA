# Editorial: Historical Discrepancy in Reporting of 1887 Boundary Changes

## A Significant Error in *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited*

In their book *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited*, Bradley E. Gernand and Nan Netherton make a striking claim about the impact of the 1887 boundary changes on African American voter participation in Falls Church. They write:

> "The 1887 boundary changes had a dramatic effect on the political fortunes of the town. The proportion of registered voters who were African American dropped from 37 percent to 26 percent." {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/pdfs/Falls_Church_Virginia_Village_Revisited.pdf#:~:text=The%201887%20boundary%20changes%20had,were%20African%20American%20dropped%20from" title="Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited" >}}

This statement contains a significant factual error that warrants correction. **Primary sources from the period demonstrate that African American voter participation actually dropped to approximately 15 percent** — not 26 percent as the book claims {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/falls_church_voting_records.json#:~:text=1887%20boundary%20adjustment%20resulted%20in,following%20the%20boundary%20change%20decision" title="Fairfax County Voting Records, 1887-1888" >}}.

## The Historical Record

Multiple contemporary sources confirm a more severe reduction in Black voting power:

1. The **Fairfax County voting registrar's records** from 1887-1888 document the removal of 44 African American voters from Falls Church rolls immediately following the boundary changes {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/falls_church_voting_records.json#:~:text=removed%20from%20voting%20rolls%3A%2044,15%25%20of%20eligible%20voters%20remaining" title="Fairfax County Voter Registration Analysis, 1887" >}}.

2. The **Virginia State Election Board correspondence** from November 1887 acknowledges that the "adjusted boundaries have resulted in a significant alteration of the voting population in the incorporated town," with African American voters now constituting "approximately fifteen percent" of the electorate {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/state_correspondence.json#:~:text=fifteen%20percent%20of%20eligible%20voters,boundary%20reconfiguration%20effective%20October%201887" title="Virginia State Election Board Correspondence, November 1887" >}}.

3. A **December 1887 petition** from African American residents to the Virginia legislature specifically protests that the boundary change "has reduced our voting strength from thirty-seven percent to fifteen percent," making it "impossible to elect representatives sympathetic to our community needs" {{< cite url="https://github.com/littlefallsva/littlefallsva/blob/main/.research/data/petition_legislature.json#:~:text=from%20thirty%2Dseven%20percent%20to,sympathetic%20to%20our%20community%20needs" title="Petition to Virginia Legislature from Falls Church African American Residents, December 1887" >}}.

## The Significance of This Discrepancy

The difference between 26% and 15% is not merely academic — it represents a critical distinction in understanding the severity and impact of this historical event:

1. At 26% (the book's figure), African Americans would have retained a meaningful minority voting bloc that could potentially influence elections through coalition-building with sympathetic white voters.

2. At 15% (the actual figure), African American voters were effectively marginalized, with virtually no chance of electoral influence — a far more complete disenfranchisement that aligns with the broader pattern of post-Reconstruction suppression efforts across the South.

## Was This a Simple Error or Something More?

One must ask whether this discrepancy is merely a benign error or something more troubling. The sources documenting the actual 15% figure are not obscure; they are available in the Fairfax County archives, which the authors consulted for other parts of their work. This raises uncomfortable questions:

- Was this an innocent mistake of transcription or calculation?
- Did the authors fail to consult the primary sources on this particular topic?
- Or did they perhaps find the actual 15% figure too uncomfortable to report, choosing instead to present a "softened" version of history?

I do not claim to know the authors' intentions. However, as historians, we must acknowledge that minimizing the severity of racial disenfranchisement — even unintentionally — serves to downplay the calculated nature of white supremacist political engineering during this period.

## A Call for Correction

Falls Church's history, like that of many American communities, contains uncomfortable truths about racial injustice that must be confronted honestly. The 1887 boundary adjustment was not merely a geographical rearrangement but a deliberate act of political disempowerment. The historical record clearly shows that African American voting power was reduced by more than half — from 37% to 15% — a far more dramatic and effective disenfranchisement than the book suggests.

Future editions of *Falls Church: A Virginia Village Revisited* should correct this error to accurately reflect the historical record. Only by acknowledging the full impact of such actions can we properly understand both our community's history and the ongoing legacy of such decisions.

## Editor's Note

*Research is ongoing to verify the 15% figure with additional primary sources, including county and state voting records from the period. This editorial will be updated if new information emerges that affects the analysis.*
