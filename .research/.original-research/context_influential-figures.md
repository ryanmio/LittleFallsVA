# Influential Figures in Falls Church History

## Early and Civil War Era (Pre-1900)

### Harriet Foote Turner (1810–1892) – Enslaved People's Liberator
A free Black woman who worked on the local Fitzhugh plantation, Turner took extraordinary risks against slavery. In 1851, instead of delivering 12 enslaved people from Alexandria's slave market to the plantation, she forged passes and led them to freedom in Canada[^1]. Unable to return home afterward, she maintained ties with family and eventually purchased land for them in Falls Church (the site of today's Tinner Hill monument). Turner's courageous act is a largely underrecognized story of resistance that enriches Falls Church's narrative beyond its white colonial heritage.

### Col. James Wren (1728–1815) – Colonial Leader & Architect
An influential colonial figure, Wren was a Revolutionary War veteran, local official, and one of Virginia's few recorded architects. He designed The Falls Church (1767), the Episcopal church that gave the city its name – a building constructed with the forced labor of enslaved people. Wren also ran a tavern in Falls Church and held various public offices, shaping the town's early civic life. His legacy is well-documented (a state historical marker honors him) and reflects both the achievements and inequalities of Falls Church's colonial era. (William Wren, a relative of James, is another early figure already profiled on our site.)

## Jim Crow and Early 20th Century

### Mary Riley Styles (1869–1946) – Library Founder in a Segregated Era
Avid reader and civic volunteer, Styles led the Falls Church Woman's Club Library Committee for 25+ years, building the town's first library collection and keeping it alive through the early 1900s. The public library (now named for her) exists largely thanks to her "loyalty and faithful service"[^2]. However, Falls Church in her lifetime was segregated – notably, in 1914 her husband Samuel R. Styles, a town councilman, helped propose racially restrictive housing laws[^3]. Mary Riley Styles is fondly remembered for enriching the city's cultural life, but the context of her era (and her family) adds complexity to an otherwise positive legacy.

### Ida Quick Hawxhurst (1867–1952) – Suffragist & Civic Organizer
Moving to Falls Church in 1889, Hawxhurst became one of its most tirelessly engaged citizens, active in church groups and nearly every local civic society[^4][^5]. She served in the Village Improvement Society, the Woman's Club, and even the Oakwood Cemetery Association. In 1913, Hawxhurst co-founded the Women's Suffrage League of Fairfax County, mobilizing local support for women's right to vote, which she championed until the 19th Amendment passed in 1920[^6]. Though she was highly respected in her time, Hawxhurst's role as a pioneer for women's political equality in Falls Church is underappreciated in popular memory today.

### Segregation Ordinance Proponents (1915) – John S. Herndon & Samuel R. Styles
In the nadir of race relations, Falls Church's white leadership embraced Jim Crow. Mayor John S. Herndon warned in late 1914 of a Black family moving into town and urged action. He and Councilman Samuel R. Styles (Mary Riley Styles' husband) pushed a 1915 ordinance to confine Black residents to a small "colored" district. This residential segregation law (the first of its kind in Virginia) passed the Town Council, reflecting a white supremacist point of view. Black residents fiercely opposed it – meeting at Joseph Tinner's home, forming the Colored Citizens Protective League, and with help from E.B. Henderson, filing suit. Thanks to their resistance, the hateful ordinance was never enforced and was repealed by 1917. In 1999, the City of Falls Church formally denounced and repudiated the 1915 ordinance. Herndon and Styles, once local power-brokers, are now regarded as negative influencers – key to telling a fuller story of how Falls Church's Black community fought for justice.

### Edwin B. "E.B." Henderson (1883–1977) – Civil Rights Trailblazer
Often dubbed the "father of Black basketball" nationally, Dr. E.B. Henderson was also Falls Church's pioneering civil rights leader. In 1915 he rallied Black residents against the segregation ordinance, speaking out even after the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in his yard in retaliation. Henderson's resolve (including filing lawsuits) helped stop the law from taking effect. In 1918, he and Joseph Tinner founded the nation's first rural NAACP branch in Falls Church, with Tinner as president. A teacher, writer, and outspoken activist, Henderson spent decades fighting discrimination – penning over 3,000 letters to editors protesting racism. Well-recognized today (Falls Church named a street after him and his wife, and a Tinner Hill monument honors them), Henderson's legacy is one of courage and "constant agitation" for equality at a time when such voices were often silenced.

### Joseph Tinner (1879–1978) – NAACP Founder & Community Pillar
A stonemason and son of Falls Church's first Black landowners, Tinner stood at the forefront of local Black activism. He hosted the January 1915 strategy meeting at his Tinner Hill home where the Black community organized to fight segregation. Alongside E.B. Henderson, Tinner led objections before the Town Council and, when rebuffed, helped charter the Falls Church NAACP. In 1918 he became the first president of an NAACP branch in rural America. Tinner's family land was later sliced by the new Lee Highway in the 1920s, symbolic of how progress often literally paved over Black communities. Once a forgotten name, Tinner is now honored by the 14-foot pink stone arch on S. Washington St., ensuring that his role in shaping Falls Church's history of resistance is publicly remembered (if still not as widely known as the Hendersons').

### Mary Ellen Henderson (1885–1976) – Educator & "Miss Nellie"
The wife of E.B. Henderson, Mary Ellen was a formidable activist in her own right. As the longtime teacher-principal of Falls Church's segregated Black school, she spent 30 years pushing to improve conditions for Black students. In the 1940s she published "Our Disgrace and Shame," a report spotlighting shocking inequalities between Black and white schools. Decades earlier, in 1915, Mrs. Henderson had helped start the Colored Citizens Protective League and later the NAACP branch. She also fought housing segregation in Falls Church, campaigning to desegregate certain neighborhoods. Known for her motto "It's the right thing to do," Henderson challenged the status quo long before "civil rights" was a common term. Widely honored today – a Falls Church middle school bears her name – she was historically an unsung hero. Her legacy, now well documented, is that of a patient yet relentless advocate who laid the groundwork for the city's eventual integration.

## Mid-20th Century (Cityhood & Desegregation Era)

### Jessie Thackrey (1913–2013) – City Founder & School Integrator
A beloved civic leader, Thackrey was instrumental in Falls Church's evolution from Fairfax County village to independent city. In 1948, she and her husband Franklin led the community drive to incorporate Falls Church as an independent city, allowing local self-governance[^7]. The very next year, they helped establish the new Falls Church City Public Schools, with Jessie serving as PTA president and later on the School Board[^8]. During her board tenure, Falls Church became the first school system in Virginia to integrate voluntarily – years before many others – and the first to offer kindergarten[^9][^10]. Thackrey also championed regional higher education (chairing the NOVA Community College board) and was active in the League of Women Voters. The city's newest preschool is named for her, reflecting her well-earned reputation. Her legacy is overwhelmingly positive, though she herself remained humble; she exemplifies the progressive, community-first spirit that shaped Falls Church's identity after 1948.

### John Alvin Johnson (1913–1990) – Unsung School Board Reformer
As the newly formed city's School Board chairman in the mid-1950s, Johnson pushed Falls Church to confront segregation head-on. Immediately after Brown v. Board of Education (1954), he argued there were "no administrative obstacles" to integrating the city's tiny number of Black students. In 1955 he formally proposed that all Black children in Falls Church be admitted to the all-white city schools the next school year. Johnson's forward-thinking stance met resistance from colleagues and Virginia's state policy of "Massive Resistance" – his letters urging immediate integration were stymied. Frustrated, Johnson left Falls Church in 1958, before seeing integration through. For decades his crucial role was overlooked, even as Mary Ellen Henderson and others were celebrated. Johnson remains underrecognized – a "forgotten champion" who tried to move Falls Church toward inclusion well before it was politically popular.

### Rev. Thomas J. Costner & Marian Costner Selby – Integration Activists on the Front Lines
This father-daughter pair personifies the struggle to end segregation in Falls Church. Rev. Thomas Jefferson "T.J." Costner (1895–1971) was the pastor of the Second Baptist Church (the city's Black church) and a determined advocate for his community. He joined forces with the Hendersons in the 1940s–50s, meeting with the librarian and school officials in 1955 to demand equal library access for Black children and better schools. His persistent lobbying helped persuade the library board to desegregate the public library for Black students and teachers – a quiet breakthrough in 1955. Meanwhile, Rev. Costner's daughter Marian Costner (later Selby) (b. 1946) became the first Black student to attend and graduate from Falls Church's all-white high school after the city finally integrated in 1961. Marian endured open hostility – from cross burnings in her yard to classmates hurling rotten fruit at her – yet persevered and graduated in 1964. The Costners' story, rarely told, adds a human face to the city's integration saga. Rev. Costner's contributions are underdocumented, and Marian Costner Selby, still living, is a witness to both the pain and progress of Falls Church's civil rights journey.

### Carol L. DeLong (1930–2023) – Barrier-Breaking City Leader
Carol DeLong holds the distinction of being Falls Church's first female mayor. A chemist-turned-activist mother, she entered public life through the PTA and Planning Commission. Elected to City Council in 1974, she served four terms (16 years) during a period of dramatic growth and change. Colleagues chose her as mayor for four consecutive terms from 1980 to 1988 – a vote of confidence in her consensus-building. DeLong championed improvements to City Hall and helped broker regional agreements on transportation funding as chair of Metro's Transportation Planning Board. She also mentored younger leaders (her family includes current local officials). Well-documented in recent memorials, DeLong's legacy is largely positive – a story of shattering a glass ceiling in local politics and guiding Falls Church through the late 20th century with a steady, civic-minded hand.

## Late 20th Century & Contemporary Figures

### Lawrence Webb (b. 1975) – Trailblazer for Black LGBTQ+ Representation
In 2008, Webb made history in Falls Church – and Virginia – by winning a City Council seat as the state's first openly gay African-American elected official. A young education administrator, Webb brought new perspectives to the historically conservative Falls Church leadership. He advocated for diversity and inclusive policies, serving one term on the Council and later on the School Board. Webb's presence itself sent a powerful message in a city that had virtually no Black elected officials before him. Still an active resident, Webb represents a contemporary positive influence, pushing Falls Church's civic identity toward greater inclusivity. His achievements are noted in state LGBTQ+ history, though locally his story is just starting to be told beyond news headlines (i.e. he remains underrecognized in public history exhibits).

### Nikki Graves Henderson (b. 1950s) – Public Historian & Social Justice Organizer
A driving force behind Falls Church's recent efforts to confront its racial history, "Nikki" Henderson has spent decades ensuring that forgotten voices are heard. She co-founded the Falls Church Women's History Walk and has led the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation as executive director, curating Black history programs and even producing the Tinner Hill Blues Festival to celebrate African American culture[^11][^12]. Under Nikki's guidance, Tinner Hill erected memorials and organized educational events to honor civil rights leaders like the Hendersons and Tinners. She also launched a local Social Justice Committee to foster racial dialogue in area churches[^13]. Henderson's visionary research resurrected the stories of many African American community members that had been omitted from city lore[^14]. Her contributions are starting to be recognized (she received a humanitarian award in 2017) but she is still an under-appreciated figure. By preserving difficult history and promoting arts and culture, Nikki Graves Henderson continues to shape Falls Church's public memory and push it toward honesty and healing.

### Mildred "Midge" Wang (1932–2014) – Champion of Local History Preservation
Known for giving tours in period costume and installing historical markers around town, Midge Wang made Falls Church's history accessible and engaging[^15]. A long-time board member of the Village Preservation & Improvement Society, she helped save historic sites and co-founded the Victorian Society at Falls Church[^16]. Wang served 20 years on the Historical Commission, organizing events like "Church and Tavern Day" (which evolved into today's Civil War Day) to bring the past to life[^17]. She even owned Mt. Hope, the city's oldest house, as a personal restoration project[^18]. Midge Wang is well-respected in local circles for preserving the "Little City's" heritage, though not widely known outside of them. Her legacy is visible at every historic plaque, walking tour, and archival map she helped put in place – ensuring that Falls Church's story, from colonial times to civil war to today, isn't forgotten in the rush of development.

Each of these individuals, in their own way, profoundly shaped Falls Church's civic identity, for better or worse. From architects and enslaved people's allies, to segregationists and civil rights warriors, to educators, activists, and cultural stewards, Falls Church's fuller, more honest story emerges through their lives. Some are already commemorated in school names, plaques, or popular lore, while others remain shadows in the archives. By profiling both the celebrated and the controversial figures side by side, the Little Falls public history project can give a richer account of how a small Virginia city continually reinvented itself – through struggle, inclusion, and the tenacity of its people.
