# Dr. Reginald Munson (1858–1946): Proponent of Falls Church’s 1915 Segregation Ordinance

## Early Life and Civic Roles  
Reginald Fairfax Munson was born in 1858 into a prominent Falls Church family that owned the Munson Hill Nurseries ([Munson's Hill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munson%27s_Hill#:~:text=Munson%27s%20Hill%20takes%20its%20name,and%20they%20built%20a%20fine)). His father, Miles C. Munson, had moved from New York to Fairfax County and established a large farm and nursery on Munson’s Hill in the 1850s ([Munson's Hill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munson%27s_Hill#:~:text=Munson%27s%20Hill%20takes%20its%20name,and%20they%20built%20a%20fine)). Reginald followed in his father’s footsteps as a respected community member: he became a **medical doctor** and was even referred to as “Colonel” Munson in local lore ([

He lived on the family estate near Munson Hill, an area fortified during the Civil War and later famous for its extensive nursery stock. Dr. Munson contributed to the town’s civic improvements – for example, he reportedly **planted the rows of silver maple trees** that once graced Falls Church’s Broad Street ([

He served on the **Falls Church Town Council**, where he involved himself in shaping town policies and development. 

## Advocating Segregation in Falls Church  
In late 1914, Dr. Reginald Munson emerged as a leading advocate for a **residential segregation ordinance** in Falls Church. At a November 9, 1914 Town Council meeting, Mayor John T. Greer Herndon warned that an African American person “had rented or was about to rent” a home in a predominantly white part of town and urged the council to consider a segregation law ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). Munson responded by **introducing the town’s first segregation ordinance**, along with Councilman Samuel R. Styles of Cherry Hill ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). The proposed law aimed to make it *unlawful* for anyone to sell or rent property to “the *Negro race*” in designated areas of Falls Church ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=Falls%20Church%20and%20thought%20the,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). In effect, it would confine Black residents to a small, prescribed section of the town and bar them from living in most other neighborhoods. Munson and Styles ardently supported this measure, but initially the council was split – at that November meeting, **Munson and Styles voted in favor**, while three other councilmen (Gould, Nourse, and Harmon) voted against, stalling the ordinance ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=the%20Town%27s%20first%20segregation%20ordinance%2C,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)).

Munson did not give up after that setback. Over the next few weeks, he and other segregationists rallied support and pointed to new legal authority from Richmond. By December 1914, Falls Church leaders noted that the **Virginia General Assembly had passed a law** explicitly empowering cities and towns to establish segregated districts for white and Black residents ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20December%2014%2C%201914%2C%20it,effect%20one%20year%20following%20passage)). The state law declared that *“the preservation of public morals, public health and public order…is endangered by the residence of white and colored people in close proximity”* ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=state%20law%20that%20allowed%20local,effect%20one%20year%20following%20passage)). Armed with this language, Munson and his allies reintroduced the segregation ordinance in stronger form in early 1915, arguing that it was **necessary for the welfare of the community**. On January 11, 1915 – despite vocal objections from Black citizens – the Town Council passed the segregation law, with Munson voting in the majority. The new ordinance **passed 4–1**, with only Councilman W.F. Harmon dissenting ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2011%2C%201915%2C%20a,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)).

### The Segregation Ordinance and Its Impact  
The ordinance Dr. Munson championed was sweeping in its intended impact. It required Falls Church to be **mapped into separate residential zones**: areas where only white people could legally live and a small area set aside for Black residents ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20June%2028%2C%201915%2C%20a,of%20the%20land)). In practical terms, the law threatened to uproot a large portion of the town’s Black community. At the time, about **32% of Falls Church’s population was African American**, many of them longtime residents and landowners ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20June%2028%2C%201915%2C%20a,of%20the%20land)). Munson’s segregation plan would have forced these Black citizens to **sell their homes or move** if they lived outside the proscribed “colored” district ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=Joseph%20Tinner%2C%20along%20with%20neighbor,of%20the%20NAACP%20in%201918)). When the Town Council met in a special session on June 28, 1915 to finalize the segregation map, they approved boundaries that confined Black residents to roughly **5% of the town’s land area** ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20June%2028%2C%201915%2C%20a,of%20the%20land)). This extreme measure mirrored residential segregation policies being adopted in other communities during the Jim Crow era. Falls Church’s vote came on the heels of **similar ordinances in Southern cities** – segregationist housing laws had begun in Baltimore in 1911 and were being tried in cities like Richmond and Ashland, Virginia around the same time ([Racial land covenants helped shape residential segregation in Fairfax County over decades – Mount Vernon on the MoVe](https://mvonthemove.com/moon-speaking/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSegregation%20districts%E2%80%9D%20created%20by%20local,declared%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%99s%20ordinance%20unenforceable)). Munson’s effort was part of this broader movement to enforce strict color-lines in housing. 

Publicly, Dr. Munson justified the ordinance as a matter of *“public order”* and community well-being, echoing the paternalistic rationale of the state law ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=state%20law%20that%20allowed%20local,effect%20one%20year%20following%20passage)). He contended that segregating the races would prevent racial conflict and preserve property values for white residents – arguments common among segregationists of that period. In reality, the policy was an attempt to **entrench racial hierarchy** in Falls Church’s geography, responding to white fears of integrated neighborhoods. The ordinance not only banned future sales or rentals to Black people in “white” areas, but also effectively **criminalized existing Black homeownership** outside the new segregated enclave. Had it taken effect, many Black Falls Church families who had lived and prospered in the town for decades would have been forced to leave their homes simply because of their race ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=Joseph%20Tinner%2C%20along%20with%20neighbor,of%20the%20NAACP%20in%201918)). Munson and his colleagues showed determination in pushing this law through – even arranging a referendum in May 1915 where a majority of the town’s (white) voters signaled approval of segregation ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20May%2025%2C%201915%2C%20the,majority%20voted%20in%20the%20affirmative)). By the summer of 1915, Munson’s segregation policy was officially on the books, poised to reshape Falls Church’s human landscape the following year.

## Opposition and Legal Challenge by Black Leaders  
Dr. Munson’s segregation ordinance immediately ignited **fierce opposition from Falls Church’s African American community**. In early January 1915 – just days after Munson helped push the law through – Black residents mobilized in an unprecedented way. **Edwin Bancroft “E.B.” Henderson**, a Black educator and civil rights advocate, convened a group of leaders at the home of Joseph Tinner, a local Black stonemason ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=On%20January%208%2C%201915%2C%20Edwin,on%20the%20proposed%20segregation%20ordinance)). They formed the *Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL)*, the first civil rights organization in Falls Church, with the express purpose of fighting Munson’s segregation ordinance ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=On%20January%208%2C%201915%2C%20Edwin,on%20the%20proposed%20segregation%20ordinance)). Just as Dr. Munson was a product of Falls Church’s influential white landowning class, these men were pillars of the Black community – homeowners, professionals, and businessmen who had deep roots in the town. Henderson and Tinner led a delegation to the Town Council on January 11, 1915 (the night of the final vote) to **plead against the ordinance**, arguing passionately that it was unjust and unconstitutional ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement,It%2C%20too%2C%20passed)). Despite their appeals, Munson and the other pro-segregation councilmen refused to reconsider; they passed the law without incorporating the Black community’s concerns ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=dangerous%20proposition%29,It%2C%20too%2C%20passed)).

Having failed to sway Dr. Munson and his peers through moral appeal, the CCPL turned to legal action. In the months that followed, Henderson’s group mounted a sophisticated **court challenge to the segregation ordinance**. They hired an African American attorney, T. L. Jones of Washington, and filed a petition in Fairfax County Circuit Court seeking an injunction to block the law’s enforcement ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20August%2010%2C%201915%2C%20the,the%20Town%20of%20Falls%20Church)). This bold lawsuit effectively put Munson’s segregation scheme on hold. As the case proceeded, Falls Church’s segregation ordinance became part of a **landmark constitutional battle**. Similar ordinances in Richmond and Ashland were also being litigated, and in each case the issue was whether such racial zoning violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20lawsuits%20were,segregation%20ordinance%20in%20Falls%20Church)). Initially, Virginia’s state courts upheld the segregation laws, giving Munson and his allies some hope that their policy might prevail ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20lawsuits%20were,segregation%20ordinance%20in%20Falls%20Church)). Falls Church officials even printed the new segregation districts into the town code in late 1916, acting as if the law were valid ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=of%20the%20segregation%20ordinance)). But the final word came from the U.S. Supreme Court. In November 1917, the Supreme Court’s ruling in *Buchanan v. Warley* struck down government-imposed residential segregation, declaring such ordinances unconstitutional nationwide ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=The%20CCPL%20then%20brought%20a,the%20ordinance%20in%20Falls%20Church)). This decision nullified Falls Church’s ordinance before it could ever be enforced. **Munson’s segregation law was effectively dead** – a significant defeat for him, but a major victory for the CCPL and civil rights. Henderson wrote with relief that because of their resistance, the hated law “had never been enforced” in Falls Church ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=segregation%20ordinance,segregation%20ordinance%20in%20Falls%20Church)). By 1918, the CCPL evolved into the first rural branch of the NAACP in the country, cementing the legacy of those who stood up to Munson’s agenda ([Racial land covenants helped shape residential segregation in Fairfax County over decades – Mount Vernon on the MoVe](https://mvonthemove.com/moon-speaking/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSegregation%20districts%E2%80%9D%20created%20by%20local,declared%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%99s%20ordinance%20unenforceable)).

It’s worth noting that Dr. Munson’s hardline stance provoked an early instance of civil rights activism that reverberated beyond Falls Church. The NAACP’s involvement and the Supreme Court ruling in 1917 set a **precedent that stopped other cities** from enforcing similar segregation ordinances ([Racial land covenants helped shape residential segregation in Fairfax County over decades – Mount Vernon on the MoVe](https://mvonthemove.com/moon-speaking/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSegregation%20districts%E2%80%9D%20created%20by%20local,declared%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%99s%20ordinance%20unenforceable)) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=Finally%2C%20on%20November%205%2C%201917%2C,States%20could%20create%20segregation%20districts)). Munson likely viewed the outcome with disappointment; his vision of a segregated Falls Church was overturned by forces larger than the town council. While he and his supporters saw themselves as preserving the town’s “order” and white character, their actions inadvertently spurred the formation of a historic Black-led resistance movement on Tinner Hill – one whose impact was felt across Virginia. In this way, Munson’s segregationist crusade backfired, galvanizing local Black citizens to achieve **lasting change in racial politics** far beyond what he had intended.

## Later Years and Development Activities  
Dr. Munson continued to be active in civic and business affairs in the years after the ordinance controversy. Although Falls Church’s segregation law was nullified, Munson remained a prominent landowner and investor. He appears to have shifted focus to real estate development in the region. By the 1920s, as he entered his retirement years, **Munson was busy buying land and constructing buildings** in the surrounding area ([Microsoft Word - Neighborhood Plan 8-30-04a.doc](https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/Projects/Documents/NC_ColumbiaHeights_Plan.pdf#:~:text=century%2C%20Dr,long%20owned%20by%20the%20family)). Family and local histories indicate that he was involved in developing commercial properties along nearby Columbia Pike in what is now Arlington. Notably, Dr. Munson is credited with building the **Arlington Theater**, an early movie house, and the Dorchester Apartments (also known as Dorchester Towers) during this period ([Microsoft Word - Neighborhood Plan 8-30-04a.doc](https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/Projects/Documents/NC_ColumbiaHeights_Plan.pdf#:~:text=century%2C%20Dr,long%20owned%20by%20the%20family)). These projects were built on land that the Munson family had owned for decades, reflecting how Reginald leveraged his family’s longstanding property holdings. 

Even as he engaged in these ventures, the shadow of the 1915 segregation fight lingered over Falls Church. The town never attempted another race-based housing ordinance after Munson’s effort was struck down. Instead, like many areas, Falls Church and its environs moved toward **private methods of enforcing segregation**, such as racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. It is telling that Munson’s own real estate developments occurred in the 1920s, when such covenants were becoming common. There is evidence that his associate Harry Birge (an attorney who partnered with Samuel Styles) incorporated restrictive covenants to bar non-white buyers in new subdivisions during that era ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=attorney%20and%20entrepreneur%20Harry%20Birge%2C,from%20Tinner%20Hill%20civil%20rights)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,that%20neither%20said%20lots%20nor)). While Dr. Munson’s direct role in covenant usage is not documented, the developments he was involved with catered exclusively to white clientele, consistent with the segregated housing norms of the time. 

Dr. Munson died in 1946 at about 88 years of age and was laid to rest in Oakwood Cemetery in Falls Church ([Miles Cleveland Munson (1831-1914) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Munson-2504#:~:text=Reginald.)) ([Miles Cleveland Munson (1831-1914) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Munson-2504#:~:text=Miles%20died%20in%201914,2)). In his lifetime, he had been a **Town Councilman, physician, and civic booster** who left a complex legacy. On one hand, he contributed to Falls Church’s physical growth – from tree-lined streets to new businesses – and came from a family that literally helped shape the town’s landscape. On the other hand, he was the chief architect of one of the town’s most notorious racist policies. His attempt to segregate Falls Church by law placed him on the wrong side of history, especially as the Civil Rights Movement later shone a light on such injustices. 

## Legacy and Public Memory  
 ([Tinner Hill Historic Site - Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tinner-hill-historic-site)) *A modern plaque at the Tinner Hill historic site recalls the 1915 segregation ordinance battle and formation of the NAACP’s first rural branch, but it does not mention Dr. Munson by name.*  

In the public history of Falls Church, Dr. Reginald Munson’s role has been largely **omitted or downplayed** – remembered indirectly through the policies he promoted rather than through any honors or memorials to his name. The 1915 residential segregation ordinance itself is well-known today as a shameful episode in the city’s past, yet the narrative typically centers on those who **fought against it** (like Joseph Tinner and E.B. Henderson) rather than those who fought for it. For example, a historical marker at the Tinner Hill Historic Site commemorates the Black community’s successful resistance: it notes that *“in 1915, Falls Church ordered residential segregation”* and highlights that the ordinance was never enforced and led to the NAACP’s first rural branch. Dr. Munson and his fellow segregationists are not named on that marker – they are simply referred to as “Falls Church” authorities. This is indicative of a broader pattern. Local history exhibits and articles often **frame the 1915 ordinance in terms of the civil rights victory**, while the identities of the white officials who proposed the racist law remain in the background.

To some extent, this omission is intentional and understandable. Modern Falls Church has sought to celebrate the courage of the Tinner Hill activists and to atone for the town’s past injustices, rather than to lionize the men who caused those injustices. In 1999, the City of Falls Church **formally repealed the 1915 segregation ordinance** – an act that was largely symbolic, since the law had long been void, but important for reconciliation ([2](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/852/Background#:~:text=1999%2C%20the%20City%20of%20Falls,Redevelopment%20reached%20the%20South%20Washington)). The City Council at that time issued a public apology to the Black community, acknowledging that what happened in 1915 was wrong ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=districts)) ([2](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/852/Background#:~:text=1999%2C%20the%20City%20of%20Falls,Redevelopment%20reached%20the%20South%20Washington)). In that apology, as in most official narratives, Munson’s name was not singled out; the focus was on the community’s healing and recognizing the heroism of those who stood up for equality. The Tinner Hill Monument, a 14-foot stone arch erected in 1999 at South Washington Street and Tinner Hill, stands as a tribute to *“the Tinner Hill residents who formed the first rural branch of the NAACP”* ([Photo Gallery • Tinner Hill Arch](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/Gallery.aspx?PID=149#:~:text=Tinner%20Hill%20Arch)). It symbolically marks the victory over the segregation ordinance. Dr. Munson’s influence is implicit there – after all, without his ordinance there would have been no need for that resistance – but he is **not explicitly honored**. There are no streets or public buildings in Falls Church named for Reginald Munson. His family name survives mainly in the geographic nomenclature of *Munson’s Hill* and *Munson Hill Road* on the border of Falls Church, a vestige of the nursery his family ran, rather than in any celebration of his deeds.

In recent years, local historians have begun to confront Falls Church’s Jim Crow past more directly, and that includes mentioning figures like Munson in context. The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation’s research, for instance, plainly identifies **Dr. Munson as the council member who introduced the segregation ordinance** ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)). Such scholarship aims for a complete record, acknowledging the uncomfortable truth that some of Falls Church’s leading citizens actively promoted racism. Still, the **public memory** leans toward celebrating progress and resistance. As columnist Charlie Clark observed, parts of the Little City’s history were long “ignored” – especially those parts that reflect poorly on its reputation ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)). The story of segregation in Falls Church was an “ignored” chapter for decades, omitted from many civic narratives, and with it the names of Munson and others faded from popular knowledge ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)). It is only with the recent emphasis on inclusive history that this chapter has been revisited in detail.

Dr. Reginald Munson’s legacy, therefore, is a cautionary one. In a **critical public history light**, Munson is remembered as a driving force behind an exclusionary policy that ran counter to the ideals of equality and justice. He exemplifies the local power structure of early 20th-century Northern Virginia that sought to enforce Jim Crow segregation even in small towns like Falls Church. His story is important as a counterpoint to the narrative of progress – it shows who and what the champions of civil rights were up against. Munson was by all accounts a dedicated civic leader for the interests of his own community, but those interests were defined by a commitment to white supremacy and separation of the races. Today, Falls Church openly acknowledges the wrongfulness of the 1915 segregation ordinance and honors the *victims and challengers* of that policy, rather than its authors. In that sense, Dr. Munson’s role has been **intentionally left in the shadows**. He has no monument, only a historical footnote as the man whose actions inadvertently spurred one of the earliest victories against residential segregation. 

## Conclusion  
Reginald Munson’s life and influence illustrate the complicated legacy of a small-town elite in the Jim Crow era. As a Town Council member and civic figure, he used his authority to try to engineer a racially segregated Falls Church, reflecting the prejudices of his time. He leveraged his standing – as a doctor, landowner, and descendant of a pioneering family – to promote a policy that would have drastically curtailed the rights of Black citizens. While he succeeded in getting the law passed, the **community pushback and legal defeat** of 1915–1917 ultimately defined this episode. Munson’s name does not appear on the honor roll of Falls Church history; instead, it is the names of Henderson and Tinner that are celebrated for thwarting his ordinance. In a fair public history assessment, Dr. Munson is neither demonized nor forgotten: he is recognized as a **product of his era’s racial politics** – a man who contributed to Falls Church’s development but also to its oppressive racial order. By understanding Dr. Munson’s role in proposing the 1915 segregation ordinance, we gain a fuller picture of Falls Church’s past: not only the triumphs of its African American community, but the forces of segregation they had to overcome. Such an honest accounting ensures that the **lessons of that Jim Crow era** – the harms of institutionalized racism and the courage required to resist it – remain part of Falls Church’s collective memory.
