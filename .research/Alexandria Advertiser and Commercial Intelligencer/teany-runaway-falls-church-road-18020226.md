# Runaway Advertisement Mentioning Fall's Church Road

## Transcription

Twenty Dollars Reward.
ELOPED from the subscriber, this morning, a Negro woman, called
TEANY,
about 18 years of age. She had on, when she ran away, a jacket and petticoat of blue plains, an oznaburgh apron and a flannel under coat. She has naturally a wild look, and has a large welt upon her back, occasioned by a burn. It is very probable, if she has left town, that she has made for her parents who live at Mr. Turberville's Quarter, about 20 miles from Alexandria, on the Fall's Church road. The above reward will be given to whoever apprehends and secures the abovementioned woman, so as I may get her again.
THOS. RICHARDS.
Feb. 23.

## Historical Context

This advertisement from February 1802 documents the pursuit of Teany, an enslaved woman who sought her freedom by escaping from her enslaver, Thomas Richards. The advertisement provides several historically significant details:

1. The use of the term "eloped" rather than "escaped" or "ran away" - a common phrasing in this period

2. Specific details about Teany's appearance and clothing, including the disturbing mention of a "large welt upon her back, occasioned by a burn"

3. Knowledge that she might be seeking family members at "Mr. Turberville's Quarter" - suggesting family separation was part of her experience

4. Most significantly for place name research, the reference to "the Fall's Church road" as a known geographic feature

The advertisement provides a glimpse into the brutal reality of slavery in early 19th century Virginia, while also documenting the courage of those who sought freedom despite the risks.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This advertisement contains a particularly notable reference to "Fall's Church road" with an apostrophe. This spelling suggests that in 1802, the area was understood to be named after "the Fall's Church" (the church at or of the Falls) rather than being named directly after the geographical feature itself.

Several aspects of this naming convention are significant:

1. **Possessive Form**: The apostrophe in "Fall's" indicates a possessive relationship - suggesting the church belonged to or was associated with "the Fall" as a geographic feature.

2. **Singular "Fall"**: Unlike many later references to "Falls Church," this earlier mention uses the singular "Fall's" rather than the plural "Falls," potentially indicating an evolution in naming conventions.

3. **Road Designation**: The reference to "Fall's Church road" demonstrates that by 1802, the church was established enough to serve as a landmark for a major road, helping travelers navigate the region.

4. **Contemporary Usage**: This spelling variation provides evidence of how locals actually referred to the area in writing during the early 19th century, rather than later standardized spellings.

This document offers important evidence that the area's name has undergone evolution over time, with various spellings and forms documented in historical records. The possessive form "Fall's Church" suggests a closer original connection to the geographical feature (the Fall/Falls) that seems to have been somewhat diminished as the name evolved to the modern "Falls Church."

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1802 advertisement provides significant historical evidence supporting the Little Falls VA renaming initiative in several ways:

1. It documents that even in the early 19th century, the area's name directly referenced "Fall's" as a geographical feature, strengthening the argument for reconnecting the city's name to its geographical heritage.

2. The possessive form "Fall's Church" suggests that the geographical feature (the Fall/Falls) was considered primary, with the church being defined by its proximity to this feature rather than the reverse.

3. This historical evidence of naming variation supports the idea that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing contexts and priorities.

4. The apostrophe in "Fall's Church" creates a direct linguistic link to the proposed "Little Falls" name, as both explicitly reference the geographical feature rather than a religious institution.

This document demonstrates that renaming to "Little Falls" would not be creating a new name but rather returning to the primary geographic reference that appears to have been central to the area's original identity, even when it was known as "Fall's Church."
