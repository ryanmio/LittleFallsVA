NTS On May 5, 1999, Ruth Sterner provided the following information:
Mrs. Lillian Rudacille, the Chief Operator, is the woman in the dark
suit standing behind the other operators; the switchboard was located
on the second floor of the bank building, sw corner of Washington
and Broad Streets; operators occassionally had to kick a board under
the switchboard to get it to work; operators thought this was a rather
primitive switchboard when compared to what some had used at other
locations; operators had to face the switchboard at all times to watch
for incoming calls. Mrs. Sterner worked at this location for
approximately two years in the late 1940s.

FORM Transcript

PHYS 5 pp.

ABS An anonymous smear campaign, in the form of an unsigned letter,
has been sent to numerous political figures alleging that Ms. Winkler
and the City Council forced the former city manager out of his job for
racial reasons and hired, with racial bigotry, the current manager. The
letter purportedly was sent by "several minority and women
employees of the City of Falls Church."
