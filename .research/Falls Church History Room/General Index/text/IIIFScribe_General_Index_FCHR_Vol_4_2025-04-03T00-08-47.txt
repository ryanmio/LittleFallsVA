NTS Since traffic volumes on Maple Ave from Annandale Rd. to Park Ave,
and on Annandale Road from the City line to Route 7, are heavier
than on local treets which typically have up to 5000 vehicle trips per
day, the City Council requests the Virginia Dept of Transportation
(VDOT) to change the functional class of these streets to collector
class, which indicates much higher volume of traffic and that through

NTS Bills would require the City to switch to an optical scan voting
system when replacing individual voting machines as they fail, and
since all machines must be uniform, this would require the city to
replace all machines at great expense if even one failed. Further, the
City Electoral Board believes the current system to be more reliable
than what the City would be forced to purchase.
