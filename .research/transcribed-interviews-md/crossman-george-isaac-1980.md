Yeah. Yeah. Two dozen houses. What were some of them to remember? Well, I delivered milk to a half dozen of them. What were some of those? Well, doctors and there's a format that was on the corner. Corner of what? 


Underwood and B Highway. Uh huh. And the Hodgson family was the other corner. Hodgson, yeah. I know Tom Hodgson. I know Tom Hodgson. Come see him. Come see him. He was at Williams County. Uh, some more names. 


There was a children that moved away. And, of course, the Scott Ryer and the whole Henry Ryer. Did you know Henry Ryer? I delivered milk there. Did you know him? Well, I know him when I saw him. But you didn't really know him very well. 


I never would. No. Did you know the Kinsleys? It's a really sad Oh, yeah, sure. They were nice people. They lived right in there. They lived on the east, the south side of the island. You're right. Right outside Hudson. 


Right where the telephone company's building is. No, not quite. Right next to it. Next to it. It's apartments right now. I don't know. And I knew the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the Eastman's and the Osher. 


Fenricks? Fenricks and Eastman's. They were, you know, I went to school, went straight through all the schools. About what period are you thinking about right now? Well, I, I guess that would be 19, uh, between 1912 and 1918. 


During the World War I period? Yeah, yeah. I was in eighth grade during World War I in Georgetown. They didn't have a high school in Falls Church, so we had to go find one someplace else. Where'd you go to grade school? 


The old, uh, what do you call it, Jefferson Institute? Jefferson School? The Jefferson Institute? Jefferson Institute? Yeah. Soap Factory? Soap Factory, yeah. When you finished there, you went to high school in the distance? 


Well, no, I had to go to eighth grade in Georgetown in order to get transferred into the high school without problems. So I went to a high school, a grade school on T, Q Street, about 33rd Q. There was three schools in one city block there. 


I can remember one of them, but I can't remember the name of the school I went to. It was right in the middle of Georgetown. Yeah, that's right. So then I went over to Tech High School and I got to get there. 


I wanted to go to Western High School because you couldn't get in there with all the rest of the kids from Falls Church and Cherrydale, wherever they were, went to Western because they could walk from the end of the street car to school. 


Yeah, I had to take three street cars to get to. And you couldn't get in because it was, the line had been too long? Yeah. Yeah. I guess I didn't. There were too many who wanted to get in. There were too many from Virginia that went to Western. 


My older sister had to go to Central, which was down on 7th and P Street, and I went on up 7th Street to Rhode Island Avenue and He died in July, and you were born in December of 1900. But your father lived. 


Father died when he was 79 years old, in 1942. Oh, you knew him a long time ago, for 42 years. No, no, of course not. Yeah, 42 years, 1942. Was he the main operator of the farm there? Oh, yes. Yes. And then following his death, what did he do? 


Ran the farm for about 10 years. Which room is that now? Well, my brother. Your brother? Yeah. Your brother ran the farm. And then Youngville took it over. No. When he got out of the Army, he bought a place east of her. 


And then Terry Farm ran it. Where's your, where's the, he'll run the Terry Farm in East Falls, pretty well. Well, I don't think he ran it. When he was a, when he was holding out for you, he went on to the Army and went overseas. 


And it was in the war. And that would be Youngville. When he got out of the Army, he came back and lived there for a little while. Maybe I don't think it was a year until he and William, my brother, could find a farm for him to operate on his own. 


And that was the one out in Herndon. That's right. In disposing of the milk and the dairy, did you? Did you carry someone into the district? Oh, yes. We had to haul it with a wagon and a horse and a horse-drawn vehicle. 


Of course, there was no automobiles. This goes back in time, how far? Well, I would guess that the rain was to pick it up. It must have been somewhere around 1915 or something. You mean when the first general pickup came in? 


Well, it wasn't hard. I think it was when the trucks became available. And I don't know when that was. That would be in the teens. I reckon. World War I. Because I could ride my bike from Underwood to a wagon with colored cars. 


and it was ten or twelve cows. What's the crossroads of? Gleeb Road. Gleeb Road. Down Gleeb Road, across Chain Bridge, down Canal Road, without any problem. Where was the slaughterhouse? That I never, I can't remember, but I know, I have somewhere in Georgetown. 


Must have been because I distinctly remember going across Chain Bridge with them. And I distinctly remember sitting on the seat of this old wagon with a couple of guys chasing the cows back in the road, a couple of times they went through the woods and they scared a little bit. 


Isn't that hard to believe? You can sit on the highway now and picture that. No cows there anymore. Sure, pretty cat. A lot of people used to come with their buckets. Oh yeah, yeah they did. I would guess ten or fifteen near neighbors would bring buckets and you'd dip them out milk out of a ten gallon can at the bottom of the cooler, ten cents a quart. 


And then I had my little route when I was maybe ten or twelve years old and I charged them two cents I think it was to deliver. I had to collect the bill. You remember Forrest Howard? Oh yeah, he and I were kind of friends, a little bitty fella. 


Yeah, I talked to him recently. He and I, this could go on all night because I get to talk and I can't quit. Had to bring the threshing machine. machine in from Loudon, I guess. We were the last one, the farthest east. 


There was one more farm, down close to the Washington, and the boy that helped with him in the cemetery, the man. Greaves? Greaves. That was the last dairy farm. Ours was the next to the last dairy farm. 


In order to get your grains thrashed, you had to wait until the guy came down from Loudon. Well, Forrest and I were throwing the bundles up on the wagon, and William was up on the wagon. All of them got along where the thrashing machine was. 


I'd lift off the two top cabs. Forrest would reach in, grab the snake, and snap his tongue out. It was kind of a cool day, and they were getting up in the shocks. We had individual shocks. You're all right. 


The lights just went off. My recollection is he got twenty-two snakes. Out of what? Where was the snake? Wheat. Oh, it was wheat shops. Wheat shops. Oh, I see. Two cap bundles on top of the shop. Yeah. 


It was a snake in many of them. What kind of snakes? Black snakes or...? I don't know what they were. Copperheads or...? No, no, there wasn't any bad snakes. Boy, boy, there wasn't snakes. Black snakes and what we used to call first and last snakes, the stripers ones. 


First and last. The coin snakes. But then the turtles moved in and the snakes disappeared. Land turtles. Yeah. Came in, lots of them. And we never had any more problems with snakes. This was just a natural happening. 


Must have been. What did the turtles do for the snakes? I ate the eggs. Oh, I suppose so, yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Who was living in the big house on North Washington Street, as you recollect? Clark and Betty. 


His wife? And Aunt Pansy. Pansy, Payne. Yeah. Cross-cross. Yeah. As far back as you remember, they were living there. Yeah. And Sue lived there for a while, so she built her own house to live in. Where did Sue build her house? 


She built it on the 25th Street, about what we used to call Cedar Street. Oh, there in that block between Underwood and Washington Boulevard? Yeah. On the west side. On the west side. On the west side or west side, whatever. 


The west side. West side toward Loudon. Yeah. It was about the third house. Third house on Underwood? Yeah. Is that where she died? She built another stone house just off of Washington, about a block further west, and I'll be doing it for her. 


That's where she died, certainly that's where she died. I don't believe she ever lived in that stone house. Yes? She was a really bad guy. Uh-huh. Let me ask you about, there, you know where, where's drugstore was later on? 


Well, that was down there at the, uh, the depot. Yeah. It was in the depot. Yeah, well, if, uh, if this is where's drugstore, right here, this thing. Yeah. And here's Lee Highway. Yeah. And here's a building across this road. 


That was actually, uh, to have a tennis over it, I didn't know it was the second floor or not, but... Well, now wait a minute, now wait a minute, originally, back at the, oh there was a two-story house that burned down. 


When did it burn? I was there when it was still smoke, smoking, and it was a printing place where the printer was. There was a print shop there? A print shop, yeah. I don't know what else was in there, and it burned down and Sue rebuilt it into a one-story building. 


Yeah, and that's where the shops and where the restaurant was later, and where Boyd's shoes were. Well, I remember one time I took her over to the cemetery on Memorial Day and she wanted to drive down the alley behind the building to see how they would take a share of things back there. 


Well, it was Gibson's little sort of fountain in their new building, in the second building there. I think so. I believe so. Bunny. Bunny Gibson. Yeah. Well, can you pick out an approximate year when it burned, 1912? 


I imagine I was 12 years old, I guess, pretty close to that. Eleanor Fenwick wasn't sure what she thought it would burn sometime before 1912. Maybe so. Well, she and I are the same age. We went to school together, and in fact, I had a crush on her. 


I thought she was the prettiest girl ever, so I'm a little... No, I think you're a Virginia fella. Oh, you're a Virginia fella? Yeah, Charlie's wife. No, Harriet, Harriet, wait a minute, we're getting your fellows, your fellows here, it's just, you know, you're the prettiest thing in the world. 


You're the prettier girl you thought was the prettiest thing in the world. Yes, right. And she married Charlie Fender, and Eleanor Eastman, I swear to you. Eleanor Eastman married Charlie Fender. All right. 


And then Virginia followed her, married Edward Fender. Edwin or Edgar? Edward. Edward Fender. You didn't call him your everything. Yes, right. Did that leave you devastated? I don't know. Was your wife from Paul's? 


No, she was from... I met her where I worked there in the Chicago area. She was from San Luis. Do you remember Pickering Dodge? Lived in a big house on the 25th Street down next to Washington Boulevard? 


I know the building. There was a cross from Nurse's House. Nurse's House and then the girl across the street. Eleanor, what was the name of her? Phil Nurse's niece that I used to chase around with. Phil Nurse's niece. 


Her name was Kinsley. Kinsley? Anyway, her girlfriend was right across the street and this fella, I think he had a wooden leg. That's Pickering Dodge. I've seen him with a wooden leg because I delivered newspapers for a little while later. 


And he's the one who took most of the pictures for Charles Stewart's little book, Virginia Village, that was published in about 1904. You never saw that book? Maybe I did, I don't know. Oh, no, I've got the full picture. 


Yeah, Virginia Village had the picture of your house just after the plan of the trees in the front yard. Yeah, it does have a picture of your house. Yeah, I remember. We had that little book at home. 


I reckon my kid's sister got the book. Sister? Louis Shaw. Louis Shaw, where'd she live? Down in Florida. Florida? Do you have any other sisters? I have an older sister, Florence. She married Romine Taylor from Dunlory. 


And she's by the way. But Dr. Frank was Romine a few days ago. I hope I don't end up that way. You remember East Falls Church more than you do Falls Church itself, I suppose. Well, the only thing I knew about Falls Church was a drugstore up there where you could buy schools. 


And then, of course, school supplies? Yeah, a candy store, a drugstore, but you know why it was the mankins. Mankins, yeah. On the corner. Well, it might have been on the corner, but I think it was up about one. 


Yeah, one drilling back from the corner. That's where Dr. Ware later had his... That's right. That's where it went down. Then of course, then there was a... Well, in East Falls Church, there was the Elditz general's building. 


Yeah. Which was Snyder's hardware later. And Elliot had a store over across Lee Highway. I remember Mitchell's barbershop. Remember the old Joe Mitchell. What about Joe Mitchell? He had that little old barbershop there all his life I guess. 


Right in the building next to the railroad track. Yeah. On the south side. Yeah. But the building next to the track. Yeah. But there wasn't any building between him and the track. That used to be one of the railroad stations. 


No. That was the railroad station. They moved it across the highway. And they hold a late 1890s. Yeah. The first railroad station they moved back and became Morton's Pet Shop among other things. And then the second one they moved across Lee Highway. 


The young man was two boys. The younger boy and I went to school together. Cecil and Russell. Russell, yeah. I was born in Russell. Whatever. He died. He lived in Ash Grove when he died. Do you remember Ash Grove near Tysons Corner? 


Yeah. I was in there when there was a girl there. There was a friend of my sister Louise. Louise and the part that lived in Ash Grove were buddy buddies. I don't remember what her last name was. I didn't know the beans were there. 


The beans lived in in that building for six or eight years. Part of it lived next door to us would be interesting maybe. You'd know Burns, Sunshine, Teenie, Buddy, and Betty. Burns? Burns. Gibson Burns? 


I never knew what to do. Oh, not a Burns family, not a Gibson. Burns family. Burns family. They live next door. On Underwood Street? Yeah. And the two girls married, the two boys, George McBoys. Oh, right. 


Do you remember Sharp Vandermark? Oh, sure. He was on the farm. He's double in the farm. What about you? Well, I'll tell you, Edward Vandermark and I were the same age when I schooled together. So he quit a great school there at Jefferson Institute because he couldn't get along with the teachers. 


And he went on to Catholic school. And I used to visit up there overnight. Thank you. Well, I guess it's about where Mill Park, uh, places on, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, 


uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I knew where the cemetery was now. 


I crushed the cemetery. Do you remember that? Oh, yeah. I remember the farm because we had our thank you and dinner there about every two or four years. They relocated. Christmas was actually a dinner. 


And Franklin was back in town from there. Yeah, that's right. Back on the issue. I don't know. Had the Crossman, any of the Crossman's ever been on what was Frank Burch's farm? To live there? Yeah. No. 


It seems to me that one of the maps of about 1978 showed a Crossman farm out there, too. A Crossman's name. No, I don't know about that. Who was there before Frank went out there? I don't know. I was just a little kid when we started going out there. 


Yeah. We still have an old, part of an old milk can. Five-gallon, ten-gallon milk can that Frank used when he was up in the dairy. He had kind of a truck farm. I was there one day visiting Milton. And I, I, anyway, they had sent a wagon load. 


One of them, Frank had taken a wagon load of boxes of tomatoes to the market. I don't know where to mark it. Probably old Central Market, Center Market. They brought them all back. Thank you. 

## Historical Context

George Isaac Crossman (1900-1991) was the grandson of Isaac Crossman, who was one of the earliest settlers to arrive in Falls Church after the Civil War. The Crossman family became one of the most prominent families in the area, operating a significant dairy farm in East Falls Church. This interview provides important firsthand accounts of daily life in Falls Church during the early 20th century, particularly from 1900-1918.

The interview captures vital details about:

1. The Crossman family genealogy and settlement patterns in Falls Church
2. Agricultural practices, particularly dairy farming operations
3. Transportation networks, including the use of horse-drawn wagons to transport milk to Georgetown
4. Educational systems, including the Jefferson Institute and schools in Georgetown and Washington DC
5. The rural character of Falls Church during the early 20th century
6. Local businesses and community relations

George Crossman's memories of driving cattle from East Falls Church to Georgetown provide particularly valuable insights into the interconnected nature of the Washington metropolitan area before widespread automobile use, when the landscape was still largely rural and agricultural.

Additional significant historical insights from this interview include:

1. **Early Falls Church Education System**: The Jefferson Institute (also called "Soap Factory") served as the primary school for Falls Church children, but the lack of a local high school forced students to travel to Washington D.C. for secondary education. Crossman describes having to attend eighth grade in Georgetown to facilitate his transfer to Tech High School. This reveals the educational limitations in early 20th century Falls Church and the community's reliance on Washington D.C.'s school system.

2. **Commercial Development**: The interview references several early businesses in East Falls Church, including:
   - Where's Drugstore, located at the depot
   - A printing shop that burned down around 1912 and was rebuilt by "Sue" (presumably Sue Crossman) into a one-story building
   - The Elditz general store (later Snyder's hardware)
   - Mitchell's barbershop adjacent to the railroad tracks
   - Mankins drugstore in Falls Church proper

3. **Transportation Infrastructure**: Crossman mentions the railroad stations in East Falls Church, noting that the first station was moved and repurposed as Morton's Pet Shop, while a second one was relocated across Lee Highway in the late 1890s. This shifting of transportation infrastructure illustrates early development patterns.

4. **Architectural History**: References to specific homes and buildings provide insights into the built environment of early 20th century Falls Church, including the "big house on North Washington Street" where Clark, Betty, and Aunt Pansy lived, and the stone house built by Sue Crossman.

5. **Social Networks**: The interview reveals the close-knit nature of the Falls Church community through Crossman's recollections of neighbors, schoolmates, and social connections. He mentions numerous local families including the Hodgsons, Ryers, Kinsleys, Eastmans, Fenricks, Fenders, and Vandermarks, demonstrating the interconnected social fabric of early Falls Church.

6. **Photographic Documentation**: Crossman mentions Pickering Dodge, who photographed Falls Church for Charles Stewart's book "Virginia Village" (published circa 1904), which included images of the Crossman family home. This reference points to early efforts to document Falls Church visually.

7. **Agricultural Practices**: Detailed descriptions of dairy farming, threshing wheat, and managing local wildlife (snakes and turtles) provide insights into the agricultural methods and challenges in early 20th century Falls Church. The story about finding 22 snakes in wheat shocks illustrates the rural realities of the time.

8. **Local Commerce**: The interview describes the practice of selling milk directly to neighbors (at ten cents a quart), with Crossman earning two cents per delivery as a child. This reflects the informal economic systems that existed before modern retail infrastructure.

These insights collectively portray Falls Church during a transitional period when it maintained strong agricultural roots while beginning to develop more complex commercial and residential characteristics. The interview captures the community before major suburban development transformed the area.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This oral history interview offers several important connections to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Historical Land Usage**: The interview documents the agricultural character of East Falls Church in the early 20th century, demonstrating how the area maintained its rural character well into the 1900s, with dairy farming being a prominent economic activity.

2. **Regional Connections**: Crossman's recollections of driving cattle from Falls Church to Georgetown via Chain Bridge and along Canal Road demonstrate the historical connections between Little Falls of the Potomac and Falls Church. This describes a geographical relationship that supports the historical connection between the two place names.

3. **Community Development**: The interview reveals information about early development patterns, family connections, and community formation in Falls Church, providing context for how the community has evolved over time.

4. **Naming Evolution**: Through references to various locations and landmarks, the interview indirectly documents the way residents understood and referred to different areas, contributing to our understanding of local place names and their usage.

5. **Transportation Routes**: The mention of Gleeb Road, Chain Bridge, and Canal Road provides information about historical transportation networks that connected Falls Church to the Little Falls area of the Potomac, reinforcing the geographical relationship between these locations.

The Crossman family history serves as an important link in understanding the development of Falls Church from a rural agricultural area to the modern community it is today, supporting the historical basis for reconnecting with earlier geographical naming conventions.
