## Transcript

You have any idea what the cords might have changed? Mr. Orland, ma'am. Well... But that part didn't change until after we came, because they still had that, they had been taken off after. And they were still there. 


They were still on the house when we came down here in 1980 to live. So it would have been sometime after nineteen. It was sometime after nineteen eight. But I just don't remember dog. Are you human? 


Well, do you remember the breakfast dog? What can you tell me about the name Cherry Hill? Well, I can't tell you, Mr. Randi, when they named her, the only thing that I have always heard, and I don't know whether Judy has heard this or not, that, what? 


There was a cherry lane now. Yes, yes. Down on Broad Street, there were iron gates, and the lane went all the way down to Broad Street. There wasn't a park everywhere. And they had... I know these cousins of mine, the way they met my grandmother and grandfather, they were driving from Washington out here one day and they had to go down Broad Street and they saw this lane, it was in the spring, and the lane had cherry trees and lilacs in between. 


And they said it was the most beautiful sight they had ever seen. So they drove up the lane and wanted to know if my grandmother would take them for the summer. And grandmother said no, she'd never done anything like that and she didn't want she has to take them out. 


But after a while they persuaded them to take them for the summer and they came out and spent several summers with them. So that's the way the fact. I've always heard that story of how beautiful that lane was and that's where I've always understood the reasons. 


But it's been called Cherry Hill as far back as anyone remembers, but it's not a recent thing. Yes. Oh, no. I, as far as I can remember, I remember them calling. referring to this child as a child. You said the changes in the, in the courts were made about nineteen-eight. 


Well and now the changes in the courts were made after nineteen-eight. After nineteen-eight. After nineteen-eight. But I cannot tell you. My memory doesn't go back to when. Just when those were made. 


Well what about other changes in the house or changes in buildings outside and that sort of thing? Oh well I can say this. I can tell you some of the changes on the interior of the house. The main room on the right hand side, the living room, which it is now, used to be my grandmother and grandfather's bedroom, it had another room there which was just about the width of the, as you know there are two windows on the side facing the garden. 


And the room at the back had, was just about the width of the window, a little bit farther than the distance of the window. And it had cut off, we used to call that. the company died whenever they had company did you remember that you don't remember that oh dude that's been a new I'm sure that they didn't change that until, well they didn't change that until after we left the house. 


Oh, I remember the roof. I never heard of the coal company then. Yeah, we all, that's what they call the coal company. I remember the room very well. Well, we used to have them, we first went down there to live. 


When we had company, we always had bathroom reviews. It was rather narrow and rather small. We had time getting around things, but just the same. That's where we had company in that dining room. But in, let me see, the grandmother died in 1927. 


We left there in June of 27. She died in March, and we left there in June of 27. And up the little house on the corner of Park and Little Falls Street. And it was that next year, so it must have been 28 or 29, my uncle tore the petition out between the living room and that small room and made it one large room. 


Then he also built up the kitchen. So you, uh, you step up to the kitchen, you still do, or do you, well I didn't realize that, well, then they didn't, then they did do anything to it. You step up to the kitchen, you didn't, uh, I thought, Well, I didn't know there were any steps now, but anyway, there is one ball, and then they did do away with one step, because there were two steps up there, and they remodeled the kitchen, 


and that was in, as I say, 28 or 29, when that was done. That was pretty complete, right? Yes. Did you say re-bottle? Do you think they started with what was there, or did they tear down what was there and rebuild? 


No, well, they started with what they had. They didn't tear the building down. No, they didn't have the building there. Well, what about buildings outside, like Melbourne interviewed Mrs. Gage in 1965, she gave me a copy of it, and she talked about the smokehouse, the greenhouse, the summer house, eight-sided. 


But not really very much information about what I wondered if you knew about any of those. I don't remember about any of those. I don't remember that either. I don't know where the smoke house was. The only thing I know are the corn cliff and the barn with the tool house and the shed. 


The chicken house is gone now and those are the only buildings that I know. There wasn't until last year a pile of logs out the back. from a building somewhere on the property. Because that's the most recent building that's gone, that I know of. 


And that was right out the back of the house. Thank you. Just across just across the driveway Back under the English Walnut And the chicken house right beside that Well, I never do anything about the smokehouse No, the summer house, I've never been like that before. 


that's something that seems strange to have the family and living there as I did for so many years not to hear anything about but I don't remember mother ever saying that somehow I thought Judy could probably supplement a lot of things maybe that I couldn't well this part about mister harvey and his plants and landscaping and that sort of thing well uncle harvey I really and truly did a perfect deal. 


wonderful thing. He practically made start at the rose garden. on the side across the fences down now that would have been turn of the century or later. Oh, yes. He started that before we came. came to their elite. 


So it must have been just about, then in my day, he, I'll tell you all those beautiful magnolias that he has on the place, were seeds that were picked up from the magnolia trees on the museum grounds. 


And he brought them out here and planted them. And then, that's the Smithsonian. Yes, the Smithsonian. Because, you see, he was in our college. Right. And he was in the Smithsonian, or the museum, museum, not the Smithsonian Museum. 


And he also, where the city hall is now, in his day, he had that whole thing from the Rose Garden to Little Falls Street in Pimps. And it was the most beautiful thing. And, as I said, we reap the benefit of those, faced the field, you know, as we used to call it, and the peony field. 


But it was the most beautiful thing, and he had gone into it really very extensively. He used to sell them, and he had some very valuable, not balls, what do they call them? Tubers. Tubers, I think. And so, but, after he, I think that was about a year or so before he died. 


It wasn't a duty that he gave a cup more or less. And, uh, I don't know, but did he give those groups to somebody, or to people? Well, yeah, I think he did too. Yes, well, of course. So, and then... There were numerous plants and things around that valuable things that he had bought and put on the place. 


And that, and that, and that, and that, and that. begin with, in my day up until the time we left the place, it didn't have a flooring very much except just wood floor, yes. Good flow up. Now it's a cement flow up. 


That's right. Yes, which I hope they take care of. Well, in my day, it was used to keep the cow on the horses, and they'd go deck-and-the-cow. That's the only thing, of course, they had hay. in the barn, in the barn. 


But other than that, it was more or less historic. They had some of their, well, tools and things that weren't kept in the tool house, like rakes and things more or less were kept in the barn. Have you ever heard stories about Civil War soldiers' names being called? 


Yes, I've heard my mother tell that lots of times. Well, tell me. Well, the only thing that I can tell you is that they, I don't know any names or anything like that, but she said that they were on the inside of the barn and the walls were the names of the soldiers of the Civil War. 


Oh, yes. That's where you can see all this grain and stuff out there. The shells of the sunflower seeds out there. That's a good looking squirrel. Yes. Well-fed. Well-fed, right? I'm sorry. You were telling me about the names of the barn. 


Yes. Well, they found that, oh, well, mother said, I've heard mother tell this many times about that there were names in the barn and the soldiers of the, apparently, the soldiers. station around there. 


But that's all I know. Were the cars interfering? Judy, I think that some of them are painted, I think. Do you remember where at the bar? No, I don't remember where. Well, what about the Have you ever heard stories about that being used to hide soldiers or about soldiers' names being cut? 


Well, I've heard the, I've heard, I've heard the story that they, that they used to have soldiers. I don't think I ever heard that they had soldiers. names and did I forgot but I you won't believe me when I tell you this up until we left there there was only a ladder that went up to that and I don't think I've been that adequate once in my life So, and I think I did walk there once after footsteps up there But that's the only time I never would go before, 


because I'm afraid of that later. Later. It was a, I'll tell you, the latter, when it was, the room was used before it was turned into a bathroom for storage room. And it had just a board over it. And there were steps coming up. 


They were where the back steps were, you see. And they put this, these boards over in place, which didn't look very secure to me. And then, what? Just sort of covered the steps. And it didn't look very secure to me, so that's one reason I never went up in the attic, because I was afraid of that latter and no steps, because it didn't look very secure. 


And so I never went, but I went up once. After a couple of steps, that's all. I've never been up to those steps again. I know they are. They're like a ladder. They're a little bit narrow. What about ghost stories? 


Have you ever heard any ghost stories about the house? Oh, I've heard lots of ghost stories about it. I can tell you some that really and truly that have happened in my day when I was there. Oh, please. 


I have gotten up, and I'm not the only one that's done this, that we have heard people coming down the stairs. And I have gotten up to go out and see who's come downstairs, because I knew everybody was around that should be around, and I wondered what was happening. 


And I've gotten out of the hall to see who's come downstairs. And another thing, and this has happened many times, and as I say, I can vouch for this. The door between the living room and the dining room and kitchen. 


Had a latch, a little latch on it, not the doorknob door, but you know a latch tackle it. And we'd be sitting there at the table And suddenly that latch would lift and everybody would stop and wait and see who would come in. 


Nobody came in. And that is actually true. Those things have happened in my day there. Oh, that's true. And so people don't believe that, but that is absolutely true. I can see, I can just see it now while I'm sitting at the table and the latch would go up and everybody would stop and wait and see. 


They'd turn around to see who was coming in and see nobody there. Everything stopped right then and there. Those are the only two ghost-like things that I can tell you about. But those two I have witnessed myself. 


And, uh, would you ever hear anybody tell any others? No, I don't think that. Have you ever heard your mother tell any others? No, I never have I. But I'll tell you a funny thing that happened to me when I was a little girl. 


I had to live. My grandfather's brother was living, Uncle George, with my great uncle. And, uh, he, uh, always, of course, I was the first of the family. This is Alfred the leaguer of the family, the beginning and the end. 


And, uh, so I, being the oldest of the family, we used to come down in the spring and the fall to visit my grandmother. And, uh, so Uncle George, as I said, I was, of course, by that time, my brother was born. 


And, uh, but, uh, just the same, as I say, I was number one branch owner. So he used every time I'd come down. when I come down in the morning to breakfast. Uncle George would be waiting in the middle of the stairs for me, and about the fourth or fifth step, he'd say, jump, Elizabeth, jump. 


And I'd jump, and he'd always catch me in these arms and take me out to breakfast. So when he passed away, which I think was about 98 in there sometime when Uncle George died, we were coming down to visit Grandmother, and Mother tried to prepare me for the fact that Uncle George wasn't there. 


there, that he had gone and I can see it now when Mother's sitting on the sofa telling me I'm gonna start out with John, I thought that George had gone to heaven and so forth and so on. And so when we went down to visit, I went down. 


One morning to breakfast. I had gone down one or two mornings and never thought about it. there, but I was going down to breakfast that morning and standing at the foot of the stairs was on the charts, just as plain as could be. 


And he said to me, Elizabeth, jump, Elizabeth, jump. and Elizabeth jumped, and I had a skin nose, and I had two other things at the time, but that actually happened too, and so I don't know what you'd call that, but anyway. 


But I was always very close, Dr. George, because I remember you used to take me down to Linda Mankins, and I don't know whether you know Linda Mankins is the old, well, Linda Mankins is a very close relative of Melvin's head. 


And she used to have the corner store in Falls Church, a dry goods store, and little, you know, these general stores in small towns, but she always had candy and things like that too, so but George used to take me down to Linda Mankins and find me the penny candy. 


But at home, I wasn't allowed to eat, because we were only allowed to eat, as I had said to the old girls we had made. We had, every Friday, she made gingerbread and taffy, and we weren't allowed to have anything else but this, because it was her name, and of course, we lived in Pennsylvania at the time. 


It was a treat for me, for that in the store, to have these marvelous candies. a penny this and a penny that, you know. So I, so all of George used to take me down, carry me down the store, and get these penny candies for me. 


And I know Mother didn't approve of them, but just the same, she did the same thing. So I enjoyed them. But, that's all. I can remember the only one thing of my infancy, mother wasn't very well at the time, Judy's mother came up to Philadelphia and got me and brought me down here. 


It was a Christmas time. And, of course, we didn't know anything up there but snow and things like that. and this Christmas of course they were doing everything they could to make me happy and of course I knew I was home safe and so well but it was one of these warm Christmas that we don't have anymore but the temperature but now you won't believe me but I tell you this story the temperature was set all the windows were open and the roses were blooming in the garden the rose were blooming in the garden the temperature was all the windows were open and I can remember Just as well as I went upstairs and I cried and I cried. 


I wasn't used to Christmas that didn't have snow and ice and everything like that, so that was Christmas, part of Christmas for me. And so that was one of the, I think, one of the most homesick times I ever spent in all my life, I think, was that Christmas here. 


And of course everybody was being so lovely to me and trying to make me feel as much home as I possibly could. What about other Civil War stories about the house, like the Battle of Peach Orchard or that sort of thing? 


Well, I was going to tell you that they always said that, you know, between Mr. Gage's and the house was supposed to be the peach orchard down there, and that's where they always said that the Battle of Peach Orchard took place. 


But there's been a dispute about that, so I don't know, but that's what we've always heard. Can you remember some of the stories you heard about it? And mothers said that they used to, after they moved out there, they used to dig up all kinds of things. 


In fact, somewhere around here, I have buttons off uniforms and things that my mother, that they've dug up out of that, and the peach orchard in that area. Well, the peach orchard was certainly there in 1861 because they found a Civil War survey which shows behind the peach orchard. 


Well, the peach orchard was there. The peach orchard was there in my day, my early days. It was there in 1861, too, so it would have been available for the Battle. Well, the mother said that mothers told that, and I had several buttons and things off uniforms that were dug up out of it from the beginning. 


And then, where the pine trees are, down across in the library, that was an apple orchard there. Who planted the pine trees? Uncle Harvey did. Remember about what time? Judy, you didn't plant that till around. 


Not till around. No. I was going to say... I think that was after we left the place, too. I think it was after nineteen-eight sometimes. No, it was after nineteen-twenty, yes. Nineteen-twenty-seven was after nineteen-twenty-seven. 


That's interesting, because we're having a sort of discussion about those yesterday, and white pines grow relatively fast. And I said it would surprise me if they were over forty years old. Well, I think you're about right. 


I think you're about right, Mr. Rand, there are. That's about what they look like. No, because for just about that time, they were tiny. Now... It used to be a road that came up there. Yes. And then I had to follow Bear Rowley through here. 


When was Park Avenue cut in front of the house? I don't know, Judy. The first map that it shows up on is 1917. for that the road goes on the way to Broad Street. But there is a big gap in the maps. Well, there is a big gap, because I'll tell you, there was a, oh, I'll tell you, that was before 1917, because it was just a dirt road that was terrible. 


And I don't know, but that, back in my very early childhood, I don't remember, I can't, just can't remember. But, To me, that road has been there for a good many years. Yeah, it was a little third road. 


Yes. Yes, that's right. You're right in front of the garden. Right in front of the garden was a terrible place. Well, I know even at the time that my father was on the town council, and something was said about, well, it said now, John, the town council all fixed the road. 


He said, no, that's just exactly what everybody said. Well, I was on the town council now for the road, you see. He had to get out of the road. So Dad wouldn't have anything done about it for that reason. 


So I don't know just when the road was after all. Dan was on the town council. I don't remember where that was many years ago. And, uh... So... Well, I wish I could remember well, I'll tell you another thing too back of the barn Right there at the side Grandfather had his guard Of small vegetables and things and he had his little nursery his hot Hotbed They're too long last in just to the side and he had There were several old delicious grape arbors back there He had let me see there were one two Three where they I'll tell you where that they rose garden just outside the rose garden and near the gate what could be the upper part of it was a grape arbor there in my area then there was a grape arbor just across the road from the back of the of the house now i don't know is that still there well there were had lovely grapes back there then back of the of the um chicken house was where he had his he had uh gooseberries and currants and blackberries and red red bass berries red blackberries were his berries all back right back in chicken house and i'll tell you something else that was on that place that i don't think anybody's ever heard of he and was brought over by uh mr harvey the englishman who owned the place and there were white blackberries now i remember those and they were down in the front right across the front of the box bushes on the other side and there were a few bushes in those white flower fairs when i was living when i lived there and i remember those when we first came down here what about that box ollie i brought that's supposed to be something that harvey brought yes he brought those that's english box from three bucks i mean he brought those so and i don't know where the harvey planted the cherry trees and the lilacs not you any idea what happened to him no i haven't i have a sized idea what happened and another thing not only did they have all those great but back of of the barn right for the side of the little uh garth vegetable garden. 


He had his fight grapes. to fight sweet breaks that have to be delicious. Um, how would you like if you have some? free time and feel so inclined to sit down with a sheet of paper, you know, and we can put the buildings on it as they are now, and then use the markings. 


and where gardens were, where you and other great barbers being and that sort of thing. Well, I wouldn't mind, would you help me? It would be extremely bad if it was something we don't have. Well, I'd be very glad to do it, because I, a chariot was very close to me, because it was my home for many years. 


And I have a very, very close feeling of chariot. And I just loved, what my memory of that place, I would love to sit down. So, you know, everybody would have, well... It's important, and it's valuable, you know. 


Well, I'd be very glad to do it for you sometime. Okay. Great. I think the reports developing is a pretty good one, I think. You'll be sort of pleased with it. Oh, I'm very interested to see this report. 


Well, somebody asked at least even some more time about it. a report of his which he hadn't yet written and they said I'm interested in seeing if he said so am I. Well, I'll tell you another thing about the old house. 


And I think my uncle has now, where the furnace is, he's put in a cement base, you see. Well, that was all just early downtown. And Mother used to tell how all of them, really, there was a great competition when it came to churning time, because they were all the most embedded readers you ever heard of in your life. 


That whole family just read. Every time they'd get their books, they'd get their hands on, they'd read. Everybody in the family read. And so the girls were all willing to go down through the churning, because they could take a book down there in the basement. 


It was nice and cool in the summertime. It was the coolest place in the summertime, so they'd take the books and go down there and read, you know. So, Grandmother, I didn't have any trouble getting it if I was to churn it for her. 


I understand from Melvin's book that James Whitcomb Riley was a relative of the family. Well, my grandfather, James Whitcomb Riley's father, her brother's. I wondered if he ever visited a cherry hill. 


Yes, he did. Good. Well, we've always said, and I don't know how true this is, but the poem that he wrote, out at O'Rack Mary's, out at Mary's, it was never O'Rack Mary's was ever O'Rack Mary's I think that's what's called was about my grandmother, but I'm not positive. 


We're not positive about that Well Tell me something about sometimes when he was there about other visitors to the place that we might know All I do know is that he used to come down there No, oh, no, I never met him But my now a little story my grandfather wasn't he's very particular about his daughter's So he wasn't very keen about But he did Well, what about other visitors in there? 


I don't know that... and then other institutions there to write a poem. If they were, I don't think that was the family I was thinking about. What was life at Cherry Hill like as you first remember it? 


What was the village like around it, that sort of thing? Well, it was, to me, it was a delightful little village. It was a village, a real honest-to-goodness village, and where you had about two or four brick sidewalks that the Village Improvement Society built. 


And then they had the... Yeah, I don't know. what do you call them, the lamps, the oil lamps on the streets, and nearly everybody in town, as far as I can remember now, most of the people had about an acre of ground, anybody's anniversary, a half an acre to an acre of ground, and the place was just, everybody knew everybody, and they, there was just a delightful atmosphere about this town, and I can't get over it. 


I still have got the village, and I refer to it to this day, now say I'm not going to, I'm going to the village, and they all say, well that dates you, I say, alright, you can date me, I'm very, very proud of that date, but I'm still going to the village, and that village was still a village in your day lately. 


I know, I'd say if you're going to the village, you can look at it somewhere for that. I think it had started to more or less build up to a certain extent after you were born. No, not too much, I guess it was. 


What about you mentioned the street lights? What about lighting the house itself? Oh, let me tell you. I can tell you that. I can tell you all about that very, very recently. Because there was no electricity in that house. 


There was no water in that house. Everything was brought in from the well. And we had outside conveniences, and up until the time we left that house. That was 1927. all over the place was heated by stoves. 


I'll tell you the remark, but still. And those of us that didn't have a hagi heater in our room had little oil stoves in our room. and a wood grain. And I have, now you won't believe me when I tell you this, but I've had the, I've had to break the ice on my, in the picture in my morning when I wanted to wash in the morning, I've broken the ice in my picture, you won't believe that, but that is. 


That's true. But it was really delightful, and I looked back on it, even with all the inconveniences and everything, I thought, well, you know, you had a very happy life. Well, I think sometimes we certainly get, we learn to expect so much, and we want so much more than what we've enjoyed. 


That's right, that's right. That's right that we have. That's right. That's maybe one of the qualities of present-day life. Well, I remember a grandmother's room was downstairs, but he's living in there. 


and she had a great big hand, and we often used it. Gather around that and get good and warm before we rushed upstairs and crawled into bed, but I remember I was privileged to have that soap stone. What happened to that old soap stone? 


Well, the grandmother had an old soap stone. We used to keep that on the back of the stone. And before I went to bed, I'd go and get that soap stone and wrap it up. a piece of woolen cloth or something and run upstairs to bed with that thing and put it in bed. 


Even then, as I said, I looked back on those people, and as I said, I looked back and I think, what is that? So, I wasn't sweet 16 that time, I. The benches on the front porch. They've always been there. 


I've never known that porch without benches. So, I just don't lie. But those benches were there back in my day. So, I don't know whether they originally came to the house or not. I don't know. Oh, that's certainly beautiful. 


What can you tell me about, well, Mr. Harvey was an ornithologist. Did he do work or experimentation or classification or anything, that type of home, or was that all done for the museum? Well, most of that part was done in the museum. 


He was, when Roosevelt, Teddy, went and took his trip to the Africa, he was going down. he of the Harvey had been selected as the ornithologist to go with him. And this is one thing I've ever quite forgiven my dear grandmother, my daughter and I loved her. 


But she wouldn't let him go. And I always felt so sorry for my uncle for that reason. But he went on several other expeditions. He went to the Bahamas, as the ornithologist at the Bahamas, and he went up to Canada and forgot about Canada. 


Do you have a copy of this obituary? Mr. Wren, I think I have. I'll have to look it up, but I think I have it somewhere. I think I have it someplace. Because I plan to go down to the Library of Congress and look for it. 


You've had it never saved any trip. Well, I'll have to look for it, because I'm right in the throes now, and if you can see mine then. There are carts and carts that my mother, things that she stored away in the attic, that I brought down here with me that I didn't even know what was in them. 


And now I'm getting to a stage where I'm not on the upward. I'm on the very side, the downward side of life now, and having had one heart attack. You don't give me that impression. No, but I am. and as I say having had one heart attack now you never know when the second one might come so I I've just suddenly realized that I'm the one that's got to get these things to the places where they should go and so I started unpacking cards and things are in the most hectic state that you have ever seen and I get so upset because I'm just so I can't work at it very long because it tires me too much and but I am getting things together and so if I ever come over anything across his obituary anything like that that I think you'd be interested in I'd be very bad to let you see it well this I've checked through the star for death announcements and obituaries and copybirds the one Well, 


I know you wouldn't know where it looked. I know that. But I'm possibly that one. I'm sure there is. Yes, I'm sure it is, too. Well, I can get it. I'm certain it's that one. And mother may have that, too. 


Just I'm trying to simplify my own work. Well, I'll tell you. I had a very unfortunate thing happen. My nephew was breaking up in his home one day, one time. And he asked if he could put some of his furniture in my garage. 


So I used the garage for the attic, because I have one of these horrible pull-down things. And they don't like me going up there anyway. So then, after he started housekeeping again, I had to move everything out to the basement. 


And in the middle of all this, while his furniture was still here and everything, I had a flood basin. And so I had to just pick everything up. I lost some of the things that I really am very regretful losing. 


But they were just beyond the water soap that I couldn't do anything about. But those are the cartons and things that I'm going through now and trying to organize and get to the place where they should be. 


Well, actually, you know, any letters from Cherryville? But, you know, like what was happening in any newspaper. And it's important to write up to 1966. to the death of Mrs. Gates. I wish just old material. 


Yes, I know well, I just wish I I just realized now the importance I was telling somebody the other day They were reminiscing about things and I said write those things down because I said when I think Mother and my grandmother told me and my grandfather I said it really makes me ill to think about how I've let history go because I didn't write it down at the time. 


Now, Judy, you're another one, too. And Falls Church is starting a pretty good collection, I think. Oh, they were, uh-huh. This beautiful little collection started in the library. Well, that's what I want to things that I feel it ought to be kept here for Falls Church. 


I want to go to that library while I'm living so I'll know that they're there. I hope you feel the same about it, too. So as I say, the things I have forgotten myself, the other day I was just thinking I couldn't sleep one night and I was just thinking about the things that I have forgotten about the place. 


I think, well, you knew more than this about the place, now what's the matter that you forgot? But I would love to sit down with you someday and have that drawing, but that's what it was about. Well, I think it would be very, very important that, well, I don't know what would be convenient or what your schedule is, but... 


Well, let me see. Next week, I had a Tuesday and Wednesday, I can't do anything. But other than that, I think next week is pretty well open. Well, pick a day next week and tell me what time's convenient and then I'll... 


Well, how about you now? I want you here, too. And what day? Is Thursday all right for you? No Thursday. Is Friday? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We are not that far along at the state of the 15th. 


Well the twenty second would be alright with me. About the same time? run across anything at that time. Well, if I could think of any more, there should be a lot of things that I should remember because, as I said, I spent the first school I ever went to, I went to a theater. 


And I had been to kindergarten and Pennsylvania. First school I came down to was school. I went back to Pennsylvania for one year, and came back here for that. in the next 3rd grade, and I went back Penn State for a degree. 


Then I went to 5th grade to Falls Church, and then I went to City from then on. Well, I know memory is sort of a funny thing. I'm constantly getting into discussions with people and the one fact that I need to make my point. 


I can't remember until I end the discussion. Oh, I see. When I'm driving home, it'll come to me. be like that. I know you can't always just dredge up everything off. Uh, no you can't. Well, uh, I... I was just trying to think of anything more I could do. 


Right at the press. Well, I'll tell you what, I'll come back to that on the 22nd, 1030, and break some graph paper and work on the plan and talk some more about what we're doing. Alright. It's been... 


Left there. The floors in that house were perfectly beautiful. There were whiteboard floors. And my grandmother used to wash those, oil those floors sometimes with just plain kerosene. And then sometimes with milk. 


That's what they are. Milk, yes. But milk. And they were beautiful. Just beautiful. And the wainscoting and everything in that place was pure white. And that pink. My mother went in that house after my uncle re-bought. 


And when she came out of that house, She was so upset. I never saw Mother so upset Mother. She said, I don't know. I don't think I'll ever want to go in that house. That was in 1920? 28, 29. Was there weights coding in the hallway? 


Yes, under the steps. But none on the side walls? No, no on the paper, on the side walls. Is this when the Rosewood Bannister was varnished to? Yes, in the hallway. And I remember this little story. I don't know whether I should tell if you got that. 


I don't know. Well, I don't know. My grandmother's not here now, so I can tell you. I remember we were coming downstairs. My grandma was upstairs with me, and we were coming downstairs, and I started down the stairs. 


Grandma says, well, I'm looking all over the stairs. She was in her same room, and so she just took over the rail, down the rail, and I stood there just spellbound looking at it. I asked my grandmother to go off on the side and break her leg or back or something, but down the stairs she went, and then she got down there and looked at me, and I don't ever get a flat. 


I can see her now. She was so thrilled, and I just stood there in the steps paralyzed. I wouldn't have ridden down that rail for anything. I think I did when I was a child, but I didn't after I was grown. 


And my grandmother in her 70s to do it, but just more than I could take. One other thing I wanted to ask you, and this reminds me of it. of the house toward the city hall, or the chimney is exposed now. 


Was that chimney always exposed, or did the weather board go all the way across at one time? Judy, I don't think that it was exposed. I think the weather board went all the way across. I'm sure it did. 


Yes, that picture is the right one. Well, that picture's the right hand, since it's better than the picture we've got, but it's the wrong end for that. When did the fire take place, anyway, in the Champions' Review? 


Oh, I don't know. I forgot to, I don't remember the letter but this is about too long ago what it's after i moved yes after we moved 30s 40s probably about that time yes it must have been about 30s and that's when the chimney was rebuilt because i know that they had the siding across all the way across and i was looking to see whether this picture might show it but it didn't it has the chimney now this was my grandmother's place in the valley what they call bear garden and No, 


that's, that's grandpa. I'm on this place at Bear Garden and you know, and we've all been, the whole family has been terribly upset about this. Years and years ago, we could have bought that place for $5,000 and we would have all bargained, everything we had almost, and the family bought it in if we'd known that the place was up for sale. 


And it had the most magnificent view. Have you ever been there too early? Judy? I haven't found you. you've got to take me up there someday this winter. I want you to discover we got to see that. And if you look from the front of the house, you looked off towards the Blue Ridge Mountains and at the back of the house you saw the other ganges in the back of the house. 


It was the most beautiful spot. Now, a bare garden. May I see that just a minute? The first one. Jody? Well, that certainly looks like Bear Garden to me. Well, it may be out of state, it may be anything, but it's very much like a dober. 


It may be noble, and I thought it was fair guard. Let's see if it's on the back of the... Oh, she's a pig. May I? Yes, you may. Thank you. Well, maybe he's lost their guard, but they're very much alike, they're very similar to this. 


The first time I was there... there. They had the, the, uh, uh, kitchen. It was an old log cabin. It was on the side. He had to put the other place out near the soldier's home. The sergeant would go to the legal north of the sergeant's house, and this was a go-to. 


And then, it was, uh, uh, at their place in, uh, out, as we called it, Rose Garden. Uh, and soldier's home. My mother met my father, and they were cousins of my father's. So that's a way back in the relationship. 


And that was a cherry? That was a cherry, and, uh, brought. It was a token. It was a good looking. Good looking drone. Here. There he is. We'll get that picture and show you the picture. Well, one of these also looks like... 


the rear of the barn while they're still in the south. A great barber there, which is interesting, but I haven't seen before. I don't think it's a great library. Looks like a big bush or something. And then this one, this one, the penguin's tree. 


Before that block was developed, it's a beautiful photograph, too. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Now who is this? This is Mrs. Morgan. That's Mrs. Morgan and that's her son Jack. And that's Jack and the horse's name is Dick. 


Well I'll say it's Dick cause Dick, I've never known any other horse but Dick. I think they've had other horses. But I think that might be a little, is old Dick. I don't know. Uh, this is painted by Mr. 


Morgan? It's painted, Mr. Morgan. Any idea what they're eating? Oh, well. Wait, I can tell you. Let me see. Mother was born in 69. It must have been painted in the late 70s, because Jack was died when he was young. 


And he and Mother, I think, were about the same age. We were about the same age. So it must have been painted in the late 17th. I think, oh, I adore that picture. Well, they both will be really excellent additions to the report. 


Well, good. I'm glad to die. Oh, beautiful. Well, uh... A home that I'll never forget as long as I live. Well, hopefully it's one that the city won't forget either. Well, that's what I'm worried about, Mr. 


Rand. I am just worried to death about it. Because with this present regime in there, they're not as historically minded and things as the previous one was. Well, I think in the report that we are going to be able to establish in an historical sense and an architectural sense that it's an important house. 


And so, you know, if decisions are made on the basis... Thank you. 

## Historical Context

This 1971 interview with Elizabeth Morgan Styles and her niece Judy Sides provides a rich account of life at Cherry Hill Farm, one of the most historic properties in Falls Church. Elizabeth Morgan Styles grew up at Cherry Hill Farm, which was owned by her grandparents, giving her firsthand knowledge of the property during the early 20th century.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Cherry Hill Name Origin**: The interview suggests that the "Cherry Hill" name derived from the lane of cherry trees and lilacs that led from Broad Street to the house. Styles recounts how her grandmother's cousins first discovered the property while driving from Washington and were so impressed by the beautiful lane in spring bloom that they convinced her grandmother to take them as summer boarders.

2. **Civil War Connections**: The interview provides several references to the Civil War's impact on the property. Styles mentions that her mother found Civil War artifacts, including uniform buttons, while digging in the area known as the "Peach Orchard," which was believed to be the site of the Battle of Peach Orchard. She notes that the peach orchard was located between "Mr. Gage's and the house."

3. **Architectural Evolution**: Styles details changes to the Cherry Hill house over time, explaining how rooms were repurposed and describing specific modifications made to the house in 1928-29 after her grandmother's death. Her description of the "company died" (a small room off the main living room) and the kitchen with its step-up entrance provides insights into the original layout and subsequent renovations.

4. **Outbuildings and Landscape**: The interview mentions several outbuildings, including a barn used for cows and horses, a corn crib, a tool house, a shed, and a chicken house. While Styles doesn't recall a smokehouse or eight-sided summer house mentioned in a previous interview with Mrs. Gage, she provides details about existing structures and their uses.

5. **Horticultural History**: Styles credits her "Uncle Harvey" with creating the rose garden "across the fences" and reveals that the magnolia trees on the property came from seeds collected from the grounds of the Smithsonian. She explains that the land where City Hall now stands was once her uncle's peony field, which he cultivated extensively for commercial purposes.

6. **Supernatural Lore**: The interview includes firsthand accounts of unexplained phenomena at Cherry Hill, including footsteps on the stairs when no one was there and a latch that would lift itself when the family was seated at the dining table. Styles also recounts a personal experience of seeing her deceased great-uncle, Uncle George, at the foot of the stairs.

7. **Climate Reference**: An interesting anecdote about a Christmas with unusually warm weather (windows open and roses blooming in the garden) provides a climatic data point and shows how environmental factors affected residents' experiences.

8. **Landscape Changes**: The interview notes that the pine trees across from the library were planted by Uncle Harvey sometime after 1927, replacing what had been an apple orchard, helping to document the evolution of the landscape.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While this interview focuses primarily on Cherry Hill Farm rather than directly addressing Falls Church naming conventions, it provides valuable context for the Little Falls VA renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Historic Property Context**: Cherry Hill Farm represents one of the oldest and most historically significant properties in Falls Church. Understanding its history helps establish the broader historical context within which the naming and identity of the community developed.

2. **Civil War Reference Point**: The references to the Battle of Peach Orchard and Civil War artifacts found on the property help establish the area's role during the Civil War period, which was a formative time for Falls Church's development. This historical anchor point provides context for understanding how place names evolved during and after this pivotal period.

3. **Agricultural Heritage**: The descriptions of orchards, gardens, and farming activities at Cherry Hill illuminate the agricultural character that defined Falls Church before suburban development. This agricultural heritage forms part of the foundation for understanding the community's historical relationship with its landscape and natural features.

4. **Community Connection to Land**: The interview reveals how deeply residents connected with the landscape and natural features of their properties. This sense of place and the importance of geographical features in defining local identity resonates with the Little Falls renaming initiative's focus on reconnecting with authentic geographical naming.

5. **Family Naming Patterns**: The personal anecdotes about family members and the naming of places within the property (like "company died") demonstrate how informal naming conventions develop based on use and family tradition, which parallels broader community naming practices.

6. **Historical Continuity and Change**: The interview's descriptions of architectural changes, landscape modifications, and property transitions illustrate how places maintain identity through change. This balance between continuity and evolution is central to the renaming initiative's goal of honoring historical connections while addressing contemporary needs.

7. **Local Knowledge Preservation**: The detailed descriptions of property features and historical anecdotes exemplify the importance of preserving local knowledge through oral histories. This preservation of historical memory is an essential component of maintaining authentic community identity through initiatives like the proposed renaming.

The Cherry Hill Farm history, as recounted by Elizabeth Morgan Styles, provides a microcosm of Falls Church's broader historical development, offering insights into how place names emerge from the interplay of landscape features, human activities, and historical events. While not directly addressing the "Little Falls" name, the interview enriches our understanding of how Falls Church residents have historically understood and named their surroundings.
