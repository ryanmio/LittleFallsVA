## Transcript

Thank you. The 10th of January, 1980, the home of Thomas E. Frazier, 2720 North Underwood Street. And this house is located on what was once a crosswind farm. Looking right out the front door, you look at the Bishop of Colonel High School, which was the center of the farm and was the dairy farm until what year, Tom? 

1950, I imagine it was, 1949. When Bill Crossman Jr., who was the last one to run it, sold out and moved out to another dairy farm near Herndon. When was your house built, Tom? 1951. Well, where did you live before you came to Falls Church? 

I lived in colonial village in Arlington. Where did you live in Arlington? I lived on North Edwards Street, 1618 North Edwards Street, where you lived as a whaler, Francis Whaler. Well, where did you, was this your native area? 

No, my home was in Petersburg. Petersburg? Yeah. Then what account? When did you come to this area? January 24, 1935. And where did you come? You got a job. And you got a job, yeah. I applied for a job at a phone company in Richmond, and they called my brother-in-law. 

I didn't have a telephone at the time. They had a job in Claringville, Virginia, for three weeks. I wanted the job, and I said, sure, I'll take the job. He said, well, go to Pittsburgh and get on the train tonight. 

The train leaves at 11 o'clock. And go to Alexandria. A man named Quitmire will meet you at the train at 4 o'clock. He came on to Alexandria. He met me. He had a room for me at the Gilshy Funeral Hall. 

Wiltshire on West Broad Street? No, on Washington Boulevard in Clarendon. Oh, okay. Good. And I lived with them for about a year and a half, I guess. And I worked here. Well, they're the same Wiltshire's that had a funeral home in Falls Church at one time? 

They could be, but I didn't know it. You didn't know that. Okay, go ahead. At that particular time... The day that I got here, there was about 18 inches of snow on the ground. And I went to work, and when my three weeks were up, I went in to see the boss, and I said, well, my three weeks was up. 

He said, well, we'll let you have a day off. I hadn't been off the same old days for three weeks. He said, we'll let you have a day off, and then we would hire you back Tuesday. So I would hire you back on Tuesday. 

And then every three months, I had to take a day off until I'd been here nine months. You'd be hired back each time? Hired back each time. And I've been here ever since. This year, I was celebrating my 45th anniversary with a phone call. 

January 1980. 45th. Well, when did you first move out to the Falls Church? I moved here in 1949. I lived with Wilson in the park over on Patrick Henry Drive. And I had bought this land up here in 1947. 

I built my house. in 1950 and we'll begin in 1951. I was moved here in 1936 by the phone company to take care of the telephone service in the Falls Ridge area, which at that time included Great Falls, Forestville, Greensville, Annandale, and down Columbia Pike to the Oval House I was over there by what is now Florida Street, Bailey's Crossroads, and down to Lexington Street and Arlington. 

That was the Falls Ridge area. Consider me better bigger than the two square miles of Falls Church Probrille When I say Falls Church in the telephone sense, I mean the area served by the switchboard located in Falls Church Where in Falls Church in the old stone bank of on a loot seven and Lee Highway up on the third floor upon the third floor There were approximately 3,000 lines In that particular office and in those days the line consists of anywhere from 2 to 18 parties per line So we had a great deal more subscribers than we had lines Lines that went up Tysons Corner night the forest bill and the drain bill at anywhere from 12 to 18 people you party liners had a good time sometimes I expect. 

Did you go clear out the Herndon went right to the. Herndon Road in route seven. I forget that route number. But it's just beyond Drainsville as the road goes back into Herndon. You know where that shopping center is. 

That's Herndon Junction. That's where the Falls Church service turned. The brick house on the right just before you get to Sugarland Run was the last house we had in the Falls Church area. Well go way back to the time when there were no telephones. 

Would you. Talk about how the telephone system developed as you know it. As I know it I worked on telephone lines that were one wire grounded circuit. Instead of taking two wires there was one wire and the grounded every station and they talked between the ground and the wire. 

Very no way the line. And they had a crank on the wall and they cranked them up. Then they came along and put in the manual telephone which required. Are you familiar with any churches part in getting that only from here say. 

Merton Potter. Reggie Roberts White. With two people that came over to Bell System when they purchased the telephone from any church they were still here when I was here. What are their names again? Potter. 

A.J. Potter. A.J. Potter. P-O-T-T-E-R. And Sadie Roberts. Roberts, yeah. She was Reggie Roberts' wife who was a painting contractor in Falls Church. And these two people came from any churches set up? 

Well, they were employed by Emmy Church and when the telephone company, the Bell System, bought him out, those employees came over to the Bell System. Well, how did, uh, how did Emmy Church get, happen to, or how did he go about getting the system as he developed? 

Developed. You know, I don't know that, you don't know that at the phase of it. You don't know the Camp Auger phase of it, no. Well, go ahead. We had this 3,000-line office and served this big expanse area, which wasn't very thick to populate again. 

You could drive out of Falls Church a mile and be out in the country, yeah, none, and particularly when you went towards Annandale, or you went towards Tyson's Corn. We had very few cables, as you see on the street today. 

Most of it in those days was wire on poles. We only had cables when I could wire. Yeah, and then bare wire. Going towards Maryfield, it just went beyond where 495 is now, cables is, and it picked up wire and went on out into the country. 

Going up towards Tyson's, it only went as far as up there, just beyond Nye's Orchard, and then it took off and wired again. Another feed went up Westmoreland Street, up to what we call Pole 127, which is at the corner of Westmoreland and 123, old 123. 

And from that junction, it went all directions, from there to Forestville, up to Old Dominion Drive, McLean, on work that way. That was a feed up that way. And another feed went up week seven, that way, and then another one went to Town of Vienna from Tyson's Corn. 

And one of the main toll lines for AT&T went from Washington to Tyson's and cable and took off to Tyson's and went to the North. Lynchburg in open wire, a copper wire. And I had worked on that for the many days. 

That went through to Centerville from Vienna to Centerville and then on across the country and down twenty-nine to Lynchburg. What was this big bevy of wires overhead on Lee Highway in 1960, for instance? 

It used to be about two hundred wires. That was the same type thing and went down into the valley, going down that way. Not in the Centerville Valley. It went on up there. The Centerville Valley has always been an independent company. 

Yeah, it went on down in the Piedmont to Charlottesville and Lynchburg. But that was owned by AT&T. That was what we call a toll line. total, long distance. Why was all that changed? You'd get more circuits out of it and you'd provide noiseless telephone service. 

The big why I got was subject to wind, storm, and rain and got noisy, and the circuits weren't too good. And you could only put so many circuits on it. With cable, you've got it encased and you can use it with carrier, which is a system that can put many conversations over four wires. 

And it needs to be very quiet and with a built-in cable. And it was much easier to maintain. Was the naked wire subject to just open noises like traffic noises? That sort of thing? No, not traffic noises. 

Pick up radio transmissions at times, depending on atmospheric conditions or conditions of the wire. Where the sleeve connects two wires together, they twisted those by hand to make a good connection. 

Corrosion would set up in that connection and would act just like a crystal. And you could hear the radio stations right on the telephone line without radio. Be on there while you were talking. And see, during this period of time, there was a big expansion in the use of telephone service as far as Falls Church and the area was concerned. 

Can you say, what do you mean by which period of time now? During 1935. And the war came along and slowed down, but in 1946, we had more subscribers waiting for telephone service than we could possibly serve, because we couldn't get the materials. 

The materials had been, we didn't get anything during the war to put telephones in there. Nothing. Everything went for the military up. So we had this big backlog, and we were hiring people like mad, trying to catch up. 

And that's when we built this Lee-Dowell Center right there at the end of this street, 1947. Underwood and Lee Highway, yeah. And that was the beginning of the expansion of telephone service in the growth of this area. 

Right then, 1947. That's when the big expansion took place. What was the Axminster, what would you call it? Axminster Exchange or telephone number. We didn't have any more numbers in Falls Church to serve customers with telephone numbers. 

But they had some numbers in Arlington, Danny Cline, that they sent up here by cable. It was Washington Boulevard and Lee Highway on cable. And from there, they picked up the local cables and carried them out to these people who lived in the adjacent area. 

We took them off the Falls Church Exchange, gave them Axminster Exchange, took those Falls Church numbers and put them out further in the country, where we had Falls Church services. We could double, almost double the amount of telephone we had if we were doing that. 

And then in 1947, what we did, we cut the cable going to Clarings on Washington Boulevard and turned it into the office at Lee Highway, 6700 Lee Highway, which is only a block from that intersection. 

So we picked up all those Axminster numbers and gave them Falls Church numbers again. So we would swap horses a lot to give service. Same way with Kenmore. Kenmore service, which is 536 now, is a Arlington service, but it served at Falls Church. 

And we did that because we didn't want to put the cable in from Arlington all the way up into the area of Lexington Street and Little Falls Road. So we turned those cables around and brought them back to Falls Church and gave them Kenmore service, which was served as the same toll center as Arlington services were. 

The art terrace prohibited us. us from taking, say, false church numbers and working them out of a toll center that's not subject to false church. The tariffs are different, the rate, toll rates are different. 

In those days, we had a big conglomeration of numbers and services, yet we had to keep them segregated by toll centers because the rates were different and we couldn't change the rates. Since that period of time, we've been able to change the rates and combine a lot of these exchanges together and give them the same toll center so that they can call and be called at a decent rate. 

It gets very complicated. I believe you. I was here during that period of time and having worked outside. as a service man for 15 years, I went into the central office to control and test and get the work done outside. 

Then we had to follow a circuit. And we grew from two installers, Walter Fallon and myself, up to 15 or 20 installers in a period of time between 1946 and 1948. So we had that much growth. Is Walter Fallon the man who used to be on the town council? 

He used to live around here. No, he doesn't live here, he lives in Murrow. Walter left here. Oh, there's another Fallon who lives around here. That's his son. Oh, that's his son, yeah. He was in the Kiwanis Club, Billy Fall. 

Well, you mentioned one time when I was talking to you about an incident in connection with a bad ice storm. Did you? Yeah. We had several of those. Do you want to tell me about a couple of them? Yeah, the one that I remember most vividly was the one that happened on Palm Sunday, 1942, that most of the service in Paul's church was down on the ground, so to speak. 

They were out of service. Because Broad Street, from one end to the other, from what is now Seven Corners, all we had to... Lemon Road was nothing but big maple trees, big old maple trees, and that snowstorm came in just about the time that they were getting small leaves on it. 

May of 1942. May? No. 1942? April. March. The latter part of March. There was a big, heavy, wet snow. Big, heavy, wet snow. And it just tore down those trees, just tore them all to pieces, and it carried all the telephone plant with it when they fell. 

It went down on the ground. We were months getting those things back. When I first came here, they had had a sleet storm from Washington to Charlottesville. It covered that general area. And the wires that you spoke of a few minutes ago that went up Lee Highway, they were down for miles, poles, wire, and everything. 

That's when we started replacing it with cable for years in that was 1932 We were still working on it when I came here in 1935 replacing that stuff They had Laid wire on the ground insulated wire on the ground With no poles to get the service back in and it was still on the ground three years later And still work And we put that stuff back up in the air and paid And I haul copper wire to get a shawl still one of my first jobs was driving the truck all in copper wire And dumping along the road to get a shawl still so that they could put the wire back up Did you have any particular Personal Experiences and connection with this big storm of 42 Yeah, 

I can remember My boss called me at 2 o'clock in the morning And asked me if I could get out and I said get out I can go anywhere I want to go he said well, do you know we got about 18 inches of snow everything? 

I said no, but I can still go So I was living in clarity time so I came to Falls Church in my own car And picked up a truck and went out and got operated and brought them in to work that day That's all I did that day was show for operators to get them into work There's nobody could move you remember and who any of the operators were best of shoemakers one of them You know best of shoemakers? 

No She's still around And she's around someplace. I haven't seen her for years, but her husband used to be the town sergeant I picked up savior Robert. She's not around anymore. She died a couple of years ago. 

And how did you manage to get down on the drug street? Well, we ran, went around it. We drive, we drive on the streets. Yeah, as far as if you go on one street and you go back and go around another one and they carry the axes and saws with us and cut our way through it. 

How long did it take you to get to the center of town? I don't really call, but it, it moved along pretty fast. It's, uh, didn't take me long to get from my house where I was living then to the garage to pick up the truck and get the chains on. 

During this period of time, the state highway people and the city people were planning the streets too, where they just had one path through there at all. So we were able to move around a little bit. 

I can remember, you remember Dopkin's Market down in the corner? We had a pole sitting right over the front of the first door. It had a cross to make a box on it. It had three great big cables on it, big cables. 

The tree had fallen right across that thing and broke it down to the ground, but it didn't break the cable off. So that's why the cable came down the pole and went on the ground. So it just broke the pole off and pulled the cable off, but it didn't break it off, and it was still working. 

That was in 1942, then. How long did that storm interrupt the telephone service? I would say that we had most of the telephones back in service some kind of way in three or four weeks, but we were a long, long time getting back to where the plant was serviceable like we wanted. 

That's the pole we put back in and all this mess, because we laid wires on the ground where we could to get the telephones back in. We laid on the ground, and when we came to the street, we laid in the garden, and wherever we could go. 

We took care of the police and the doctors, people like that first. Was that the worst storm of that kind that you recall? In this particular area now, I went to Connecticut in 1938. On a hurricane storm, it was the worst I'd ever seen. 

I worked in Connecticut for six weeks rebuilding. plant that had been thrown down by a hurricane. But the 42 storm was the worst one in this area that we experienced. 1957, well, 58, I always get this mixed up. 

We had one that did a lot of damage, but the telephone service wasn't out everywhere like it was in 42. Pembit Hills, we had just been built. They were built on Stanley Rowan, was building it then. And that was a rattle of flimsy built house. 

Telephone wires had been attached to a mold and it went up beside the roof. And when the heavy snow hit it, it pulled the molding off. It pulled the molding off the Harrison and Wyethall on the ground. 

We had over 5,000 of those things. laying on the ground over here at one time, and telephones were working, but the wires were on the ground, likewise and telephones were on. That particular storm seemed to hit from the wall of churches and then landed on towards Tyson's, and up that area more than he did from seven corners to Bailey's Crossroads. 

No. I've been in supervision since 1951. During that particular period of time, I had as high as 150 people reporting to me during a storm like that. He bought them from everywhere we were born and brought them in here to restore service. 

Luckily it doesn't happen all over the country at one time. That's how I got into Connecticut. We had over 3,000 telephone men sending New England from the Bell system during that time. What year was this? 

1938. Oh, that was right after that big hurricane. You really can't visualize how much strength wind and water had. They had boats a mile, three quarters of a mile off the coast, sitting up on dry land when that thing left. 

As far as you could see. I remember that storm very well. They had a tremendous amount of wire, like you spoke of a minute ago, we call it open wire. Just pay a wire on hold. on the Boston Post Road, I never forget it as long as I lived, they had ten cross arms with ten wires each on them. 

And they were all laying on the ground, caught up with the pile wire. They cut the pile off at seven o'clock in the morning, everywhere. We'd go to work, and when we came in it talked and turned the pile back on again. 

You couldn't work right there with the pile. It was all messed up together. You didn't know what was the telephone pile and what was the light pile. So they just turned it off. Well, safely they turned it off so the workmen could go out and do the work. 

How long did that stay up here? Six weeks. Well, you've lived around Falls Church since 1935. A lot of things have happened. during that time and there have been a lot of changes since that time. You want to talk about just Falls Church as a community and as people and you spoke about. 

Well let's talk about the community. Community consisted primarily of stores on Broad Street and Lee Highway. It didn't extend much beyond where R.B. Park or where you are now. Businesses didn't go any further than the rest of the residents is primarily older homes. 

Most of them use coal for heat and then the seven corners wasn't as seven corners as now the Virginia foot. Thanks for watching! 

## Historical Context

Thomas Fraser's interview provides a detailed account of the development of telecommunications infrastructure in Falls Church and the surrounding region during the mid-20th century. Fraser moved to the area in January 1935 and worked for the telephone company for 45 years, giving him a unique perspective on the area's development through the lens of its communications infrastructure.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Telephone Infrastructure Development**: Fraser provides a detailed chronology of how telephone service evolved in Falls Church from early one-wire grounded circuits with hand cranks to more sophisticated systems. His description of the technical evolution includes the shift from open wire on poles to underground cables, reflecting broader patterns of infrastructure modernization in the post-war period.

2. **M.E. Church's Role in Early Telecommunications**: The interview references Merton Elbridge Church (M.E. Church), an important Falls Church entrepreneur who established the area's first telephone system before it was purchased by the Bell System. Church was a significant figure in Falls Church's commercial development, and Fraser notes that some of Church's employees, including A.J. Potter and Sadie Roberts, continued working after the Bell System acquisition.

3. **Geographic Service Areas**: Fraser describes in detail the extent of the Falls Church telephone service area, which was much larger than the city itself. It included Great Falls, Forestville, Greensville, Annandale, parts of Columbia Pike, Bailey's Crossroads, and extended to the Herndon Road. This helps map the regional connections and service networks that linked Falls Church to surrounding communities.

4. **Infrastructure Challenges**: The interview documents major weather events that affected telecommunications, particularly the Palm Sunday storm of 1942 that brought down trees and telephone lines throughout Falls Church. Fraser's descriptions of the cleanup and restoration efforts provide insights into how the community responded to infrastructure crises.

5. **Post-War Expansion**: Fraser describes a significant backlog of telephone service requests after World War II due to material shortages during the war years. The construction of the Lee-Dowell Center at Underwood and Lee Highway in 1947 marked "the beginning of the expansion of telephone service in the growth of this area," linking telecommunications development directly to the post-war suburban expansion.

6. **Residential Development**: The interview notes that Fraser built his home in 1950-51 on land he had purchased in 1947, which was formerly part of the Crossman farm. This timing aligns with the post-war housing boom and the conversion of agricultural land to residential use throughout the region.

7. **Exchange Systems**: Fraser explains the complex system of telephone exchanges (Falls Church, Axminster, Kenmore) and how they were managed and reconfigured to accommodate growing demand. His explanation of how numbers had to be assigned based on toll centers provides insight into how early telephone networks influenced community boundaries.

8. **Rural-to-Suburban Transition**: Fraser's observation that "you could drive out of Falls Church a mile and be out in the country" in the 1930s, combined with his description of gradual infrastructure expansion outward from the town center, documents the transitional period when Falls Church was evolving from a rural village to a suburban community.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

Thomas Fraser's interview offers several connections to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Regional Interconnectedness**: Fraser's detailed description of the telephone service area demonstrates how Falls Church was connected to neighboring communities through infrastructure networks. This regional perspective supports understanding Falls Church's historical relationship to geographical features like Little Falls of the Potomac.

2. **Geographical References**: Fraser mentions specific location names and routes, including the Herndon Road, Tyson's Corner, Forestville, and other landmarks that help establish the historical geography of the area. These reference points can help document how residents understood the region's geography.

3. **Infrastructure Development Timeline**: The interview provides a clear timeline of development from the 1930s through the 1970s, which helps establish when certain areas were developed and how place names might have evolved during this transitional period.

4. **M.E. Church Connection**: The references to M.E. Church's role in establishing early telephone service highlight an important historical figure whose name became associated with the area. This illustrates how individual contributions can become embedded in community identity - a relevant consideration for any renaming initiative.

5. **Land Use Transformation**: Fraser's home was built on former Crossman farmland, which exemplifies the transition from agricultural to residential land use that transformed Falls Church in the mid-20th century. This transformation represents a pivotal period when community identity was being redefined.

6. **Historical Continuity**: The interview describes technological changes over time while maintaining references to consistent geographical features and communities. This balance between change and continuity mirrors the considerations involved in a renaming initiative that seeks to honor historical connections while addressing contemporary needs.

7. **Natural Disasters as Markers**: Fraser's vivid description of the 1942 Palm Sunday storm provides a reference point for understanding how natural events affected the landscape along Lee Highway, which included "big maple trees" that were damaged by heavy snow. These landscape features help reconstruct the historical environment of Falls Church.

While Fraser does not specifically mention "Little Falls," his detailed account of regional infrastructure development provides valuable context for understanding how Falls Church related to its surrounding geography during a formative period in its development. His perspective as someone who witnessed and facilitated the area's communication connections offers a unique lens for understanding the community's evolution.
