About 19... Just before the Depression. Do you remember the Depression? Yes, I do. I was living in Washington. I had moved out and we come from Leesburg to Washington in 25. We moved out here in Virginia in 27. 


We were living in Washington when that happened. No, it wasn't. We were living out here. I was living out here when that happened. That happened about 1932, wasn't it? Twenty-nine. That's when my oldest son was born. 


He was born in 1928. Did you have any tough times during the Depression? No, I sure did. I got along just fine, thank you, Lord. My father and mother lived in those Macarenes on the farm. But I can't remember whose farm they lived on. 


But at that time, they were living on the farm. They had pictures in the garden and everything in the farm. They were funny to me. My daddy worked on the farm. At that time, no, I got along just fine. 


I didn't have nothing to make or lose. I didn't have nothing to lose. I didn't have to worry about anything. That's wonderful. That's right. It's like Mandy Ellison. Do you ever hear of Mandy Ellison? 


Yes, indeed. Mr. Shree was telling me the other day that she could go right over to the streetcar line. She never missed a streetcar. Because she just took the first one that came along after she got there. 


Mandy Ellison was the first cousin to my daddy, Will Jones. Mandy Ellison? Yes, sir. Mandy Ellison was the first cousin to my daddy. This is Mandy Ellison lived there at the corner of Broad and West. 


Broad and West. You know where the... Oh, that's somebody else, yeah. Oh, that's the Ellison. I know who you're talking about. That was Wright. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about, yeah. 


So this was Mandy Ellison lived down there like he was caught. I thought you were talking about her. But you're talking about the Ellison that used to live on the... Broad Street. That's right. I don't remember none of them. 


You don't remember any of them? No, I don't. Hmm. Did you used to use the collie? Oh, Lord, I used to ride all the rails up and down the... and I'm a little street car ride car that goes from Fairfax to Roslyn. 


You got it from Fairfax to Roslyn, yeah. That's right. Yes, indeed. I remember them. Did you... used to ride them up until about the time they stopped. Well, I'd ride them until they stopped. And after a while, they put these little autorails on there to run on the rails and run on the road too. 


And after that, they had the process. Yeah. Did you use a little autorail some day? Yes, I used to ride a little autorail too. Were they fun to ride on? Yes, there was fun to ride on. That's right. Did any of them ever have any mishaps? 


No, they never had no mishaps. I never had no trouble in our oil. Mm-hmm. Well, do you remember E.B. Henderson? Oh, yes, I remember Mr. Henderson, E.B. Henderson, and Ms. Henderson. His wife was my children's teacher, Ms. 


Henderson. His wife? She killed her teacher. Yes, she was a teacher. She was talking about Jane Blee's school at that time. Uh-huh. For my children. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. And you probably got acquainted with E.B. 


too. Yes, indeed. But I used to work for Ms. Henderson. Over on Maple? That's right. I used to work for that. She had authorized so bad, she couldn't do her work. Uh-huh. And I used to go there and help her. 


But when, what time was that? When was that? Well, that's been a good many years. I don't think I could tell you exactly what year. What year? Before the big war? Before World War I walked in? Oh, yes, a long time before that. 


It must have been around about 1930 or 39. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. How about Kato Adams? You remember him? Who? Kato Adams? No, I don't remember him. You don't remember him? Mm-hmm. He lives in Washington now, but he used to live with the Hendersons. 


No, I didn't know him. No, I really didn't know him. Did you ever hear of him? No, I never heard of him. Yes, sir. He lived out here for quite a while. Yeah. He's a real fun man. Yeah. No. No, I never heard of him. 


Yeah. He's, uh, he lives in Washington now. Oh, he lives in Washington now. And while, just before E.B. died, his two sons were here. Mm-hmm. Uh, and I met them both. Yeah, but I have never even met her son. 


And then, uh... But it was off in college when I was, uh... Then in 1975, I think it was, we had a reception for E.B. Yeah. Over at the Second Baptist Church. Yeah, I remember that. You do? Yeah. Were you there? 


No, I wasn't there. You remember about it, though? Yeah, I remember about it. Yeah. And then he lived only about a year after that. That's right. He was a great old man. Yes, he was. He was a nice man. 


How about Reverend Powell? Did you know Reverend Powlett? Yeah, he was my minister. And? He was the one that loved to have the one that baptized me at Second Baptist Church. At Second Baptist? Mm-hmm. 


And he lived over on Virginia. That's right. He sure did. Right next to the library. That's right. He lived right there. That's where he lived. That house was built along about the time of the Spanish-American War just before 1900. 


You mean the one he lived in was there by that time? Yeah? I thought it was an old place. Well, along that corner he wouldn't look at it. We'd hardly believe it now if you look at it. That's right. That's how it used to be. 


That's right. Mm-hmm. Do you remember about the people who used to live on West Broad Street? About, do you know where the, in the 400 block where the flower shop is now? There used to be some tinners. 


Ollie Tinner used to live there. Ollie Tinner? Mm-hmm. That's where he used to live. There were some turners, too, weren't there? There still was, but I can't believe it. You never knew them very well. 


No, there was some tailors over there, too. Yeah, tailors. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, tailors. Tinner, Taylor, and I guess some turns, too. Yeah, lived down there. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's been a long time ago. 


Well, are you enjoying living in an apartment? Yes, I'd love to live in an apartment. I lived over there. I raised all my kids over there on Railroad Avenue, though. Oh, let me ask you. If you come down Railroad Avenue from Fowler Street, who lives in the last house? 


Well, that's where my father lived. That was his house. That's where he lived. That belongs to my husband and Charlie Reckon. Charlie Reckon and my husband. Well, who is the old gentleman that lives there now? 


You see, the old gentleman lives there? Yeah. Well, that's supposed to be my husband. But we've been separated for 30 years. Oh, you've been separated for 30 years? Yeah. What's his first name? He doesn't have his name after his daddy, William Henry Rector. 


William Henry Rector. How old is he? He's 80, 81. 81? Uh-huh. Is he in good health, I hope? Well, I tell you, he's in good health, and the only thing, he's got bad feet. Uh-huh. And we try to get him to go to the hospital to be operated on. 


But he don't want him to do it. Uh-huh. And that's the house where you raise your 16 children? No. Just before you get to that house, there's another little house, two rooms. Uh-huh. I raised my kids in them two rooms. 


Oh, yes. That's right, my father-in-law. Brought the land from my, uh, from his dog, my sister-in-law, and he put two, there were two rooms on that, on that piece of land, for half an acre. Two rooms, yeah. 


Uh-huh. Yeah, and I raised my kids, all of them, and they got napped there for, oh, I guess, for years. I was there for about 30 years. About 35 years. 35, might have been 40. And just those two rooms all that time? 


That's two rooms all that time. What'd you do, stack them on top of each other? I guess I did. Sometimes I think to myself, I in a world did I raise all them kids in two rooms, but I sure did. I raised them in two rooms, and my husband was a man like this. 


He wouldn't work, I mean, he did, all he'd done was got children, but he didn't work, kept their care, kept, you know, make-away from. Uh-huh. So I raised them myself. I worked there, like, I used to work for Mr.

## Historical Context

This interview with Anna Mary Rector provides a valuable window into the African American experience in Falls Church from the 1920s through the 1980s. Born in Leesburg, Anna Mary Rector came to Falls Church around 1925 (she mentions coming "down here 50 years ago" during the 1980 interview) and married into the Rector family, a well-established Black family in the area.

Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Family Connections**: Anna Mary Rector was married to William Henry Rector Jr., whose father (William Henry Rector Sr.) had worked for the Rowells, a prominent white family. This employment relationship provides insights into the economic interdependencies between white and Black communities in early 20th century Falls Church.

2. **Labor and Employment**: Rector describes various jobs she held throughout her life, including working for prominent local establishments such as Bryant's restaurant in the Rust Shopping Center, a restaurant on Hillwood Avenue, and for E.B. Henderson's wife who had "arthritis so bad." These employment patterns illustrate the economic opportunities available to Black women in Falls Church during this period.

3. **Housing Conditions**: Rector's description of raising 16 children (15 surviving) in a tiny two-room house on Railroad Avenue provides powerful testimony about housing conditions for Black families in segregated Falls Church. She mentions living there for approximately 40 years, indicating the stability but also the limitations of housing options for Black residents.

4. **Black-Owned Businesses**: The interview references several Black-owned businesses and professionals, including George Washington Thomas (the "shoe man"), Robinson (who had a barber shop under the bank), and a mention of Eugene Tree's store "on the corner." These businesses formed an important part of the economic foundation of Falls Church's Black community.

5. **Interracial Relations**: Rector's matter-of-fact descriptions of working for white employers and her familiarity with various parts of Falls Church suggest a community where racial boundaries existed but with complex everyday interactions across those boundaries.

6. **Transportation**: Her references to riding "the rails" (the trolley that went from Fairfax to Rosslyn) and later the "autorails" document the transportation options available to residents in the early-to-mid 20th century and how they connected Falls Church to the broader region.

7. **Religious Life**: Rector mentions Second Baptist Church, noting it was where her father-in-law was buried and where Reverend Powell served as minister. This church was a central institution in Falls Church's Black community, providing not only spiritual guidance but also serving as a community gathering place.

8. **The Great Depression**: When asked about the Depression, Rector notes that she "got along just fine" because her parents lived on a farm where they grew food. Her comment that she "didn't have nothing to make or lose" provides insight into how economic crises affected different segments of society in different ways.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While Anna Mary Rector's interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides important context for the renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Inclusive Community History**: Any renaming initiative should acknowledge and incorporate the experiences of all community members, including historically marginalized groups. Rector's interview offers perspectives from Falls Church's African American community that should be considered as part of the full historical context for renaming discussions.

2. **Continuity of Place**: Rector's long-term residency in Falls Church (over 50 years at the time of the interview) and her detailed knowledge of local geography and changes over time demonstrate the deep roots many families have in the area, regardless of socioeconomic status. These enduring connections to place should be respected in any renaming conversation.

3. **Multi-dimensional Understanding**: The interview reveals aspects of Falls Church history that might not appear in official documents or mainstream historical accounts. This more complex, multi-dimensional understanding of the community's past is essential for making informed decisions about names that accurately reflect the area's authentic heritage.

4. **Geographical Knowledge**: Rector's familiarity with various locations throughout Falls Church, including Railroad Avenue, Fowler Street, West Broad Street, and other areas, provides insights into how residents understood and navigated the community's geography before modern development. This helps establish the historical context for how place names evolved and were used by different community members.

5. **Community Connections**: The interview highlights the interconnectedness of Falls Church's residents across racial lines, even during segregation. These connections form an important part of the community's identity and should be acknowledged in discussions about names that represent the area's heritage.

Anna Mary Rector's recollections offer a perspective that enriches our understanding of Falls Church's history beyond the dominant narrative, demonstrating that a complete picture of the community's past must include diverse voices and experiences. Her story of raising 15 children in a two-room house while working various jobs throughout the community represents the kind of determination and resilience that has shaped Falls Church throughout its history.
