## Transcript

Here we go. Grandmother's house. Yeah. When was this house built? I did. My grandmother's house. I don't know when that house was built. Who built it? Did your grandmother build it? Yeah. Well, now, you know, I don't even know that, to tell you the truth. 


I don't know that. I don't know. They came out here. Let's see. He built this house. I don't really know. After all, they came out here. Certainly, after Annie was born, about 1890 or so. She's going to Washington, I guess. 


Oh, is she? No, maybe she's going to Pittsburgh. She might have been going to Pittsburgh, by the way. Now, Vaudevant, excuse me. I really don't know when they came to Falls Church. No, I didn't. Well, it was somewhere in the first decade. 


Before 1910. Oh, certainly. After the Spanish-American War. Oh, certainly. It was, I would guess, I would assume it was very much after the 1900s. It certainly had to be soon after the 1900s. Even he was living out here before he married, wasn't he? 


Not living here. Not actually living out here. No. I mean, he spent a lot of time out here. Time out here, but he lived in Washington. He stayed at Mrs. Holland's. He used to stay up on 11th Street out of Mrs. 


Holland's house when he was caught in my mother back there earlier. Who built the store? Annie built the store. No, well. No, no, not the first store. The first store. The first store. My grandmother built that store. 


I would guess she built that store, you know, like in the 20s. About in the 20s, that store was built. When I was probably a very little young, youngster, when that store was built. Was it just a general store? 


It's a general store. Just a general grocery store, right. Yeah. Did she run it? She ran it. She ran it. She ran it. And it was the main, you know, you know, clerk and everything else. My grandfather kind of did the jobs around, but mainly my grandfather carried groceries up on the hill. 


He would carry groceries up to the people on the hill here. And of course, up on the hill, you know, by the Baptist Church and all up here. And what was his name? His name was William. William A. William A. 


William A. William A. Yeah. Of course he had come, you know, from Vicksburg. That's where he was born. And he was the one who, no, Vicksburg, Mississippi. He had been first, his name wasn't Henderson. 


His name was Roddegies, according to Ian Stettner. No, it wasn't Rodriguez. No, it isn't. It is not Rodriguez. It's something like R-O-D-I-G-U-I-Z. It's not Rodriguez. It's R-I-D-O-G-U-R, like Riddegies, something like that. 


Similar name. Similar name, but not. His father had been a Riddegies. Well, how did his name get to be Henderson? They changed it. This plane changed it. Just decided to change the Henderson, that's all. 


This plane changed it. After he came up here? No, no, before he came up here, in Mississippi. And he was born in Vicksburg as William Riddegies, but when he came up here, and I think before that, they took on the name, and I think his father did even here to him, took on the name of Henderson. 


I don't even know what, I can't tell you, probably it says in Steadman's book, what year he came up here, but of course when he came here, and I can't really tell you when he met Louisa Mars, his wife, but I would assume they must have met in Washington. 


I'm sure that's right, because yes, my grandmother came to Washington with her sister, Alice Chiu. Alice, no, with Alice here, Alice, but there was Alice Mars, and Meredith Chiu, and they came to Washington, and somehow my grandfather came, even to work on the railroads or something like that, and met my grandmother in 1882. 


1883, got married like February or January of 1882, and my father was, 1883, and my father was born nine months later, in November. Do you remember the little police station here? Oh, a certain amount of the police station, and Mr. 


Thomas' shoe store right next to it, and this was- Was this the point building, or was that- No, no, that white building was where the Robinsons lived. I used to get my hair cut there. Robinsons? Robinsons, and then they moved, and they still have relatives. 


His son, or daughter-in-law, still lives up on Cypriot Street, but that's where the first people I knew who lived there were the Robinsons, and I used to get my hair cut there. And what was the third building on the other side of the street? 


Well, that was Mr. Thomas' shoe shop. You mean, he had a shoe shop there after he got off the corner? Oh, yeah, but when I knew him, he had the little shoe shop right, that little building in between the police station and the- I forget who lived in there. 


house who lived in Dixon maybe I can't remember I don't I don't remember I can't remember who lived there I don't remember maybe well then there was the house you know back off the street the Hicks now the Hicks's lived down in that house didn't the girls yeah the two girls were their names Hicks's HIX or something like that they live there and then I should remember that man's name he had dogs who live back off the street and let me see if that that would have to be his house back here this would be where those girls let's see I was right next to mr. 


Walters house Walters right Walters right Walters lived back off the street didn't he yeah and of course that would have been the way this picture shows it, too many trees, because, you know, his house was well back off the street, wasn't it? 


This, this house had to be, this house had to be across, let's see, where's the graveyard? Beginner begins there? Yeah, it begins there, doesn't it? My, my grandmother's store was right on there. It was right next to the fence. 


My grandmother's store was there. Right across from her was the house I'm talking about that was here. Walter's lived back, you know, some distance back, which would have to be, if it's in this picture, what is that supposed to be right there? 


What is it? It looks like, like a chair or a barn, doesn't it? No, this is a barn here. It's a barn. But that's not a house either. It looks more like a barn, doesn't it? Yeah, the house that he lived in had to be back off. 


But there was a house way back here, you know, close to what's now Maple Avenue. Yeah, maybe that's the road right there. It came back here, and he's right about there. Well, I don't think it was back that far. 


Well, you can see it. Back this far. Yeah, there was, there was. Do you remember anything about it? Well, when you came around the corner here, and came up Fairfax Street here, other than Gundry's stores over here, Gundry's Farm, you know, Gundry's, Miss Gundry's asylum or whatever for atypical children. 


The only thing on this side of the street, after you passed, there was a roadway, but that went up to her place. I don't remember. But there was a lane that came back. There was a lane that came out right down, it came out right down here at the corner, as you came around that corner. 


It came right down here, and you go to Miss Gundry's. And I don't remember the house, but that would. You mean when you say you go to Miss Gundry's? Yeah. You mean there was no South Maple Street there at all then? 


No, no, no. There was a street there, but it wasn't South Maple, so it was there. Well, but I mean where the big bowling alley is now. There was no. Street there was no street there. Oh, no, there wasn't a street there. 


No, it wasn't. It's not here. No, it wasn't there No This was taken when 40 45 40 Now now it's the winter this is in the winter you can see things alive Except I gotta turn around or something like that.

Yeah, but look, what I'm trying, what I'm trying to see is that is the, uh, that thing there. That's, I see what you're saying. You look at it this way, you can see it, but it's left-handed to me. That's Grandma's house. 


The store, the store had been, the store was. It was right in here, but it's gone. Yeah, it's gone. I don't know what that, what that is in there. Now we're beginning to see, yes, there's the bank. You're right. 


That's, uh, that's the house I was saying that, uh, Mr. Robinson lived in. That was the police station. Mr., um, this is the house sometime. What was this little one? That, that's the, that's the shoe shop, unless it was between the two. 


That would have to be Tom's shoe shop. That's certainly. And then you lived down here? These are the people I'm saying lived across from my Grandma's store. I don't remember their name. Yeah. And this would be the roadway back up to Walter's, wouldn't it? 


Yeah, but Mr. Walter didn't live there when I knew him. Yeah. Well, that's, that's, that's where it went back to the house. I don't know. When did the house, when was the house ever moved? It wasn't moved. 


It had a fire practice and burned it. Is that so? It wasn't here then then. That's right. Yes, at this time it was. Where did it, what happened to it? When did it burn? Oh, that's a. Now this is going down the corner.

I don't even remember that. See, it looks like the street had been wired. I wasn't around here then. It looks like they've done some things that I don't even remember. Uh, this was, as I say, where the police, where the police, what's that man's name? 


Rush, Rust. Oh, I think his name was Rust, you stay there. And this is where the two daughters live, those two girls live there. Yeah, that's where they lived with the parents, because that was back off the street.

That's after World War two 1960 Well, as you were hanging on to some old cars, 1960, when did Andy Biller steal us? I think so. You got some pictures here. Look at the 1949 picture. Let me see it. I hear it shows some of the stars right here. 


Yeah, but let me see your 1949 era photo. But, yes, it was right next to that driveway. It was here on West Fairfax. Yeah, right. Yeah, we had a big hedge in between the two. That's Swift. Yeah, those were the Swifts. 


Swift shows on Port Picture C-2239, dated July 1946. Just to the north of the 307 South Maple. Palm Swift, Judy Swift. I can't remember the old man, I can't remember, I remember Tom and Judy and they had two daughters and maybe two sons, I can't remember now. 


They remind you of the family that we look at the Waltons. As a matter of fact, they kind of remind me of the Waltons because I remember two generations in the old family. Were they white people? Yeah, they were white. 


Oh yeah, we, we, we, that's the point. We played just like we didn't know the difference. That's true. Yeah, we just didn't know the difference. At that time, it looks like they were just building, weren't they? 


Yes. In, in Ms. Gundry, somebody had bought Ms. Gundry's property by then and they were putting up the apartments. This is by when? 48 that they did that. Oh yeah, these are all, I can see, yes, they've got, I came to Falls Church in 1947. 


Now this house was still on the hill, isn't that something? This house there, you see the bowling alley was not there. That house is where I used to go up there, the windmill up there. Who in the world lived up there? 


I shouldn't know. Oh, you mean right behind the heckengers? Yeah, up on the hill. That's all that was up there was a big house. Big old frame house. That's right, it had a windmill, first windmill ever saw. 


And I, first time I ever saw how you could attach a windmill to a pump and, and pump water. Wasn't there a house that was closer to heckengers? I can go right down below here. Oh, the Brents. Now the Brents lived, the Brent house. 


They're closer now. The Brents house is, let's see now if I can locate too many trees in here to see much. Well okay, our house is here. There's the Brents house right there. Right where the heckinger's corner is. 


They sold the heckinger, I guess, the Brent house right there. Right there at the corner of whatever, well the street is there now. It's the street over, second over from this one. It was right on the corner, that wasn't on the corner, it was back off the street. 


It was halfway between Lee Highway and, and Maple off of that street that runs on the other side you know this park I'm in this shopping up here second Street over and it was situated halfway between Lee Highway and Maple Avenue the Brents and then Heckerd of course bought and took up all the space. 


Looks like Heckerd is here. Was it already on here? Right there I think. Well look there is this building here. There is a building here. Kind of a longish building? Yeah. Yeah that's a long. But the thing you're looking at is not, no that's the, that's the. 


Of course if you go ahead. You mean Lee Highway? No. You know when you go from here and go towards what we call the farm and you get up on the top most part after you're at the edge of whole church. I guess so. 


Is that the sign there? And then you start going down. Yeah. And you remember there's that shopping centers at A and B. Well the topmost hill and they built houses up on the side of the hill. That's horseshoe hill. 


Horseshoe hill goes around in that kind of a direction. It actually forms a horseshoe like You mean the shape of the shape of the hill. Yeah In other words the highway goes right on through part of that hill As it makes a horseshoe, I guess around I think it probably goes around probably goes around like I guess it goes around probably like this You think the highway cuts through the highway cuts through about the middle of it. 


I suspect I think that's probably right Yeah, because when you get down on Andale Road, there's no more hill, you know, the hill ends up on 150 Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, right, but I'm saying if you were to go back back that would be South The hill runs out over there By or by before you get to right 50 right back over by there Well, yeah, that's 50. 


Yeah, that's good. Yeah, but that's what we call horseshoe hill and we always When we used to go to the farm You know, we used to always say we have to go up by horseshoe hill to get to the farm Which was a mile and a quarter from here. 


Do you remember anything about the birch britches Frank birch? Just knew the britches. I can't remember anything about the birth. Well, not telling you Where the National Memorial Cemetery then, you know during well during the Spangburg War, it was the place Where the soldiers bivouac it was their hospital. 


It was Camp Alger camp. Oh, yeah, well, they brought them back Camp Alger was spread over a lot of ground and they had their headquarters in Well right near Dunlory house still stays that's how they use it Dunlory. 


Yeah. Yeah, it's you know or how school is. You go out on Lee Highway to Gells Road and turn right on Gells Road. And about, oh, less than a mile if I was recording a mile. There's a school house on the left. 


And right behind that school house was this headquarters. But now, if you're going out from Falls Church to the farm, you went out Lee Highway. And then was the farm on the right. Right across from Graham. 


Dr. Graham at his house. Right where? Big frame house. Yeah, big frame house. On the top of that hill. On the left. On the left. That was Graham. And Graham owned, Graham owned the first part. He owned the property right next to that road. 


We didn't own that. That was owned, at least we had it. He owned the property that was on Lee Highway. Was his property all on the left side of the road? No, he had, as I say, if you were on, here's Graham Road. 


is Lee Highway and you're going on up here and I guess this road over there, yeah. Graham had his house here. You went up here and you went into the farm off the road here. Oh, wait a minute, no, it's just... 


Here's where you're at. And it's Safeway. Safeway is here. Yeah. Well this would be West Street. That's West Street. Yeah. That's West Street. Isn't that how you got the farm, by going up West Street? 


Yeah, we went up West Street, right. Into the sort of what's back entrance to the cemetery. No, there was a dirt road right here. Yeah. There was another dirt road right here. And the back entrance is way down here. 


The back entrance is way down here. So Graham owned about all this, Dr. Graham owned all this property over here. Yeah, before we got to our place, our farm ran here. Oh, you were, but he was, I mean, you were behind Dr. 


Graham. Or on this. From the highway. This would be the north side of the highway, right, going toward Fairfax, actually. And his house was here. Yeah. And we started some, I don't know, you know, 300 feet or so after you left here and there was a big cherry tree right here. 


That's where, that was the marker, I guess, was that cherry tree right there. Still there, I guess. I don't know. It may be. I don't know. Then we would go in and the old house, the big house that went with the camp was right here. 


Went with the camp? It went with, you know, Camp Alton. It went with the old. It was a big house that they used. Well, yeah. That also then, down here below there, I guess that was the big place for either the, because it was always a big concrete wall down below the hill. 


There was always a big concrete wall down here. I never saw, I have to assume that maybe there had been one time either barracks or stables. I don't know which. You mean right next to the house? No, down the hill from there. 


Oh, down the... Yeah, here was the house. And the biggest thing this, now this is still here, there's a huge, beautiful element. tree with absolutely wonderful branches and this was where the pump was. 


The pump was right there. I remember that clearly. Where is the pump? Where is it? And the house was kind of up the hill from there. What was Mr. Norman's first name? Colonel Norman? Yeah. Colonel Norman? 


I don't even know. Colonel Norman's first name? You all bought the place from him. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. How big was the pond? How big was the pond? 67 acres. Exactly. Over six to seven and a half acres. 


Always had to sign with no time to sell. Had the farmhouse been built by Colonel Norman? I don't know. It was a huge. house. I don't know. You have no idea of when it was going to be on the 8th. No, I don't know. 


When did it disappear? When they showed it to the National Superior Cemetery. They demolished it. Yeah. It was in. did you sell it did your family sell it to the cemetery my the people who owned it it was owned by three people Kato Adams my father four people Kato Adams Sam Compton my father and assistant superintendent Wilkerson got Garnet Wilkerson Garnet Garnet Wilkerson who was the assistant superintendent of schools in Washington DC and who was the other man Sam Compton was a teacher at Armstrong High School I guess he taught mathematics and Kato and my father they they're the ones who went into the venture lost their shirts oh really yes sounds like chicken George's money somebody came up with a some kind of a deal or bargain with them and they were always in trouble I think I think this like chicken George I think my father borrowed money from my mother to buy it and then of course I guess it was it was forced with foreclosure when they had to sell it they always said they were doing you know you're talking about the person came along soon after they probably bought it in the I guess the 20s probably in the early 20s because I remember it as early as I can remember anything going out and going up on the buggy and on the wagon and picking apples and this is I can remember the earth so they had to be in the 20s they sold it probably in the depression years in the like the 30s I think probably they probably sold in the middle to late 30s I think before I left you in 39 I'm sure they'd sold it by then so your life with all the church who was spent either here in this house or out at the farm mostly well it was spent here but we go up to the farm Sam Compton lived in it all the time Sam lived in it most of the time it was his house to live in that he's gone the ropes that would come out sometimes in the summer him and his wife but Sam lived in there until he moved the halls most of the time. 


And then it, I guess then it, I remember it was abandoned though after that. I don't remember really in the last years that anybody was living there, as I recall it. I don't really think so. Did you enjoy it out there? 


Oh yeah. What did you do? Were you just a boy then? Oh yeah. Was that fun? Oh yeah. I was, as I say, I, this was in the, in the late 20s particularly, in the early 30s, I don't remember that we did much up there. 


As I say, I suspect that they sold it in the middle 30s or so. I think they sold it before I left here. I think they did. But I used to go up and I remember I was doing a number of things. I remember we had three used cherry trees, or four. 


Yeah, two on the highway and two back. And of course holly, I remember we had some beautiful holly trees, which we used to get holly and I used to make wreaths. things like that I remember we have mostly apples though most of it of the sixty seven acres I guess half of it was probably an apple or I would suspect Yeah, and some of it was open land which was father would go up and farm with friends and John who lived with us here, 


and whoever else. And at times I remember he'd have to do his night because he would come home from, you know, work in Washington and had to go up and get, get a lady, that was the name of our horse, Lighty. 


Take a lady up there and attach it to her on a plow at night. That's the only time we could do it. Lighty got killed right out here. I remember. Always when I thought that was a terrible name. I never could understand why a lady, my father bought Lighty from, I don't know, some, you know, good buyer, a seller, and it had to be in the, was she a workhorse or a? 


Well it had recently been a riding horse, you know, not a, it had been a riding horse. I don't remember that we had more than two horses, I can remember. Lighty was one, we had another, but the thing that happened with Lighty was the highway it comes with you, as I say, about. 


Thank you. 

## Historical Context

This interview with James Henderson provides valuable insights into the history of the Henderson family, one of the prominent African American families in Falls Church during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Several key historical aspects emerge from this oral history:

1. **Henderson Family Origins**: The interview reveals that James Henderson's grandfather originally had the surname "Riddegies" (or similar spelling, not Rodriguez) and was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The family changed their name to Henderson before moving north. This name change reflects the common practice among formerly enslaved people to adopt new surnames after emancipation.

2. **Family Business**: The Henderson family operated a grocery store near the intersection of Fairfax Street and South Washington Street in Falls Church, which served as an important business in the Black community. James Henderson notes that his grandmother built the store "in the 20s" and ran it herself, while his grandfather "carried groceries up on the hill" to customers.

3. **Community Layout**: Henderson provides detailed information about the layout of Falls Church in the early 20th century, particularly the area around what is now the intersection of Fairfax Street and South Washington Street. He references several landmarks including the church, the police station, Thomas' shoe shop, and various residences, helping to reconstruct the physical geography of historic Falls Church.

4. **Business District**: The interview details several businesses that formed the commercial core of Falls Church, including Henderson's grocery store, Brown's hardware store (which also sold groceries), Abbott's grocery store (which later became Dawkins and then an EGS store), and Sam Poho's grain and feed store on the southeast corner of Broad Street.

5. **Social Geography**: Henderson's descriptions reveal the social geography of Falls Church, particularly how the Black community was centered around specific neighborhoods, including "up on the hill," which likely refers to the area near the Baptist Church.

6. **Timeline of Development**: The interview suggests that Henderson's grandmother's store was built in the 1920s, providing a timeline for the development of Black-owned businesses in Falls Church.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

While the Henderson interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides valuable context for the renaming initiative in several ways:

1. **Community Heritage**: The interview documents the contributions of the Henderson family to Falls Church's development, highlighting the diversity of the community's historical narrative. A complete understanding of Falls Church's history must include perspectives from all community members, including African American residents whose stories have often been underrepresented.

2. **Historical Accuracy**: Any renaming initiative should be based on a comprehensive understanding of the area's history. The Henderson interview helps fill gaps in the historical record, particularly regarding the Black experience in Falls Church during the early 20th century.

3. **Geographical References**: Henderson's detailed descriptions of locations and landmarks provide insights into how residents understood and navigated the geography of Falls Church before modern development changed the landscape. This helps establish the historical context for how place names evolved and were used by different community members.

4. **Timeline of Development**: Henderson's recollections about when certain changes occurred in Falls Church help establish a timeline that can inform the renaming initiative, showing how the community developed and how its identity evolved over time.

5. **Inclusive History**: The Little Falls renaming initiative aims to reconnect the community with its authentic historical identity. Including perspectives from historically marginalized communities, such as those represented in the Henderson interview, ensures that this reconnection honors the full breadth of the area's history rather than a selective version.

Henderson's family history of changing their name from "Riddegies" to Henderson also offers an interesting parallel to the community's consideration of a name change, suggesting that names and identity can evolve while maintaining historical continuity and authenticity.
