# Enslaved Laborers in the Building and Life of The Falls Church (Anglican)

## Colonial Beginnings of The Falls Church  
Founded as a mission church of Truro Parish in 1732, The Falls Church was central to the early community that grew at the colonial crossroads near present-day Falls Church, Virginia ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20forerunner%20to%20the%20Falls,Church%20%20near%20%2059)) ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=met%20in%20November%201732,3)). From its inception, the parish's prominent families were tobacco planters and slaveholders, and they relied on enslaved African Americans for nearly all large-scale labor. In **1733**, the vestry contracted Col. Richard Blackburn to construct the first church building – a wooden structure 40 by 22 feet – for a price of 33,500 pounds of tobacco ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=Known%20as%20,the%20land%20and%2C%20in%201746)). Although no enslaved workers are named in the surviving parish records of this project, later histories conclude that this original "William Gunnell's Church" (as it was then known) was **built by enslaved laborers** owned or hired by Blackburn and the local planters ([](http://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=and%2C%20thus%2C%20the%20European%20demand,Parts%20of%20these)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=The%20church%20was%20constructed%20by,in%20the%20face%20of%20adversity)). The skilled workmanship noted in the wooden church – from its weatherboarded walls to its paneled interior modeled on nearby Pohick Church – was very likely the product of **enslaved carpenters and artisans** whose names went unrecorded ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=Known%20as%20,the%20land%20and%2C%20in%201746)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=The%20church%20was%20constructed%20by,in%20the%20face%20of%20adversity)). Early vestrymen such as **William Gunnell**, on whose land the congregation first met, and **John Trammell**, who later deeded the two-acre church lot in 1746, were substantial slaveowners ([Report for Cherry Hill Historic House and Farm on the Existence of Enslaved and Free Black Individuals on the Property from 1845-1868 - Enslaved Labor](https://cherryhillfallschurch.org/about/research/report-for-cherry-hill-historic-house-and-farm-on-the-existence-of-enslaved-and-free-black-individuals-on-the-property-from-1845-1868-2/#:~:text=Trammell%20Tract%20,Northern%20citizens%20into%20the%20Falls)). Trammell's 248-acre tract (essentially the heart of today's Falls Church city) was patented in 1729 and, like other local plantations, "utilized enslaved labor" for tobacco farming and household work ([Report for Cherry Hill Historic House and Farm on the Existence of Enslaved and Free Black Individuals on the Property from 1845-1868 - Enslaved Labor](https://cherryhillfallschurch.org/about/research/report-for-cherry-hill-historic-house-and-farm-on-the-existence-of-enslaved-and-free-black-individuals-on-the-property-from-1845-1868-2/#:~:text=Trammell%20Tract%20,Northern%20citizens%20into%20the%20Falls)). A 1749 tithables list shows John Trammell paying levies on *six* enslaved adults, underscoring how integral enslaved people were to the local economy and the parish's operations ([Sampson Trammell Sr. (abt.1729-abt.1804) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Trammell-579#:~:text=from%20being%20named%20second%20in,his%20father%27s%20will)). Though unnamed in church records, these men and women almost certainly felled timber, sawed planks, and hauled materials to build the first Falls Church, and they maintained the surrounding "Rolling Road" transportation network that brought parishioners to worship ([](http://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=and%2C%20thus%2C%20the%20European%20demand,Parts%20of%20these)) ([](http://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=warehouses%2C%20inspectors%2C%20and%20ports,nearby%20marked%20along%20Annandale%20Road)). In short, the **physical foundation of The Falls Church was literally laid on the backs of enslaved workers**, a fact largely omitted from traditional narratives centered on its famous vestrymen like George Mason and George Washington. 

## Enslaved Workers and the 1760s Brick Church Construction  
By the 1760s, the original frame church had decayed, and the vestry (which included **George Washington** as of 1763) resolved to erect a more substantial building ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20a%20Vestry%20held%20at,on%20the%2029th%20day%20of)) ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=October%203rd,Wardens%20for%20the%20ensuing%20year)). The new edifice – the brick church that still stands today – was constructed **between 1767 and 1769**. Col. **James Wren**, a planter-architect and vestryman, drew up the plans and oversaw construction ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=the%20new%20Fairfax%20Parish.,5)) ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20new%20church%20was%20designed,6)). Like his fellow vestrymen, Wren was a slaveholder, and he *"used enslaved people to do the work"* of building the church ([The Falls Church - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falls_Church#:~:text=The%20new%20church%20was%20designed,6)).  Surviving accounts and research make clear that enslaved laborers carried out nearly every aspect of the project: **digging clay and firing bricks, cutting timber and carving woodwork, and hauling supplies** ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=In%201769%2C%20architect%20James%20Wren,with%20the%20institution%20of%20slavery26)). An 1764 notice inviting construction bids had specified that the building was to be brick with a gallery and measured by 1,600 square feet ([Notice of Truro Parish Vestry Meeting, 20 March 1764](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/02-07-02-0177#:~:text=Virginia%2C%20Fairfax%20County%2C%20March%2020%2C,1764)); ultimately, **Maj. Charles Broadwater** – another local plantation owner and vestryman – undertook the contract as general builder (referred to in records as the "undertaker" of the work) ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=James%20Wren%20and%20Thomas%20Price%2C,%E2%80%9D)). Broadwater almost certainly deployed his own enslaved craftsmen for tasks like masonry and carpentry. Indeed, parish minutes from 1767 record Wren and another vestryman inspecting the nearly finished brickwork and finding a small shortfall in materials; the vestry then ordered Broadwater to compensate for the deficiency ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=James%20Wren%20and%20Thomas%20Price%2C,%E2%80%9D)) ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=James%20Wren%20and%20Thomas%20Price%2C,for%20their%20proportion%20of%20the)). This entry not only documents Broadwater's responsibility, but by extension hints at the unpaid Black workforce under him who actually laid the bricks. Later local histories explicitly acknowledge that **"enslaved individuals performed various tasks such as laying bricks and crafting woodwork"** for the 1769 church, and that many of these enslaved laborers were owned by members of the congregation itself ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=In%201769%2C%20architect%20James%20Wren,with%20the%20institution%20of%20slavery26)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=tasks%20such%20as%20laying%20bricks,the%20institution%20of%20slavery%2029)). In other words, the very people sitting in the pews (the Washingtons, Masons, Broadwaters, Gunnels, and others) were often the masters of the people sweating to build and maintain those pews. We have, for example, records of the vestry paying for nails and other materials, but the blacksmiths and sawyers who produced those were likely enslaved. **James Wren's personal slave, "Charles (a blacksmith),"** is specifically named in Wren's later will ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)), suggesting that a skilled enslaved blacksmith on Wren's plantation may have forged nails, hinges, and ironwork for the church's construction. Another enslaved man known only as **"Piper"** is listed in Wren's estate next to Charles and Charles's wife Sarah ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)); while we don't know Piper's trade, it is conceivable he and Sarah labored in support roles during the building of the church (whether preparing food for workers, tending animals, or other essential tasks). The brick church's completion in late 1769 stands as a material testament to Black labor. Yet in vestry documents of the era, the **enslaved builders remain nameless**, identified at best indirectly as property (e.g. "Maj. Broadwater's people"). Only through wills and probate files of their owners can we now retrieve glimmers of their identities.

## Named Enslaved Individuals in Records of Falls Church  
Piecing together primary sources, we can begin to identify a few of the *previously obscured individuals* who built and sustained The Falls Church and its community. One important source is **James Wren's will (written 1808, proved 1815)**, which enumerates over **20 enslaved persons** that he apportioned among his family ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Wren%20died%20in%201815,Register%20of%20Historic%20Places)) ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=These%20enslaved%20persons%20were%20named,1)). Because Wren's plantation was in Falls Church and he had been deeply involved with the church's construction and upkeep, the people he enslaved are directly part of Falls Church's story. Among those named in the will are:

- **Nelly** – an enslaved woman listed as already "in the possession" of Wren's son James Jr., and formally bequeathed to him ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). Nelly had likely been born and brought up on the Wren estate. A recent historical reconstruction of her life reveals that she was *"born on the Wren plantation in Falls Church"* and spent her childhood laboring in Wren's tobacco fields ([Nelly's Journey: A Life in Chains and a Quest for Freedom | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/nelly#:~:text=My%20name%20is%20Nelly%2C%20and,I%20would%20discover%20within%20myself)) ([Nelly's Journey: A Life in Chains and a Quest for Freedom | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/nelly#:~:text=As%20the%20property%20of%20Colonel,backbreaking%2C%20and%20the%20respite%20scarce)). Though her exact role in constructing the church is unknown (she may have been too young in 1769), Nelly's life was intertwined with the church plantation economy – she and her family produced the wealth (tobacco) that financed church operations. Her story, as later chronicled, highlights the human cost of this "peculiar institution": Wren's will shows Nelly was **treated as property to be passed on**, but she survived into the Civil War era and eventually gained freedom, an odyssey that reflects the larger African American experience in Falls Church.*** ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=members%20of%20our%20community%20are,collective%20healing%2C%20understanding%2C%20and%20growth))*** 

- **Charles** – an enslaved man described in Wren's will as a *"blacksmith"*, given to Wren's widow Sarah ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)). Charles and his wife **Sarah** (and a third person, Piper) were to remain on the Wren property. Charles's inclusion and title indicate his specialized skill. It is very plausible that Charles had been the *blacksmith responsible for much of the ironwork* at The Falls Church – from making nails and locks during the 1760s construction, to repairing tools and shoeing horses for parish use. Blacksmithing was a highly valued craft often performed by enslaved artisans. Charles's presence in the record is a rare instance where an enslaved person's *occupation* is noted, allowing us to appreciate that enslaved people were not only field hands but also **skilled craftsmen essential to the church's maintenance** ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20wife%20Sarah)). 

- **Kitty and Lilly** – two enslaved women whom Wren's will bequeathed to his son James Jr., alongside Nelly ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20son%20James%20,possession%20already)). We know little else about Kitty and Lilly from the will alone, but their grouping with Nelly (and the fact that they were already in James Jr.'s "possession" before 1815) suggests they too lived and labored on the Falls Church property. They may have been domestic servants in the Wren household or farm laborers on the surrounding land. Either way, they supported the daily operations of a prominent Falls Church family. Indirectly, women like Kitty and Lilly also supported the church: for example, by cooking the meals and making the clothing that allowed the Wren family (and other slaveholding families) to sustain their status and focus on endeavors like church governance. Their lives remind us that **enslaved women's work – raising children, preparing food, tending the sick – was part of the social foundation on which institutions like The Falls Church rested**.

- **Will** and **Janney** – a man and woman whom Wren had already given to his married daughter Betty Hughes's family in 1806 ([James Christopher Wren Sr. (1728-bef.1815) | WikiTree FREE Family Tree](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wren-173#:~:text=to%20children%20of%20daughter%20Betty,in%20the%20spring%20of%201806)). Though they did not remain in Falls Church by the time of Wren's death, Will and Janney likely spent years on the Wren plantation prior, and possibly helped during the War of 1812 when Falls Church was a mustering point. (In August 1814, President Madison fled through Falls Church as the British burned Washington; one local account notes that Dolley Madison's enslaved valet Paul Jennings assisted her escape through this area ([](http://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=Europe%20by%20the%20late%2016th,casks%29%20to)). The presence of enslaved people like Will and Janney in Falls Church households would have been typical in such wartime upheavals – enslaved workers drove wagons, cooked meals, and tended horses for both their owners and sometimes even for passing American troops.)

Beyond Wren's estate, other **enslaved individuals surface in local archives**. In Fairfax County court records, for example, a chancery case related to the estate of **Henry Gunnell** (a Falls Church vestryman in the 1750s-60s) mentions an enslaved woman named **"Nelly"** and a man named **"Randolph"** as part of the property in dispute ([Virginia Memory: Chancery Records Index - 059-1891-002](https://www.lva.virginia.gov/chancery/case_detail.asp?CFN=059-1891-002#:~:text=Moore%20Nelly%20)). Gunnell's family had been involved with The Falls Church for generations (Henry's father, William Gunnell, hosted early Anglican services in the 1720s). While we can't confirm this Nelly is the same person as Wren's Nelly, it is clear that *multiple enslaved individuals named Nelly* lived in the Falls Church area across the 18th and early 19th centuries. The recurrence of such names highlights how common and yet how faceless these people were in the records – a single name like "Nelly" or "Will" might be repeated for different individuals, none fully documented. 

We also find evidence of enslaved people serving in direct support of the church's religious functions. Vestry minutes from the colonial era show payments to **sextons and church clerks** – for instance, in 1757 the Truro vestry paid *"Edmund Porter for his attendance at ye Church"* and **William Gladdin** for serving as sexton (sexton at the Falls Church and at Alexandria). Those particular men appear to have been free (Porter and Gladdin were likely white laborers), but it was not uncommon for Virginia parishes to use enslaved workers for menial church chores. Falls Church tradition holds that enslaved people sat in a **segregated gallery** and likely helped maintain the churchyard. A late-18th-century entry in the parish poor records even notes the church paying for the burial of a Black man (identity unknown), hinting that enslaved or free Black congregants were present in the community of worshippers ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=Wealthy%20families%20in%20Falls%20Church%2C,influence%20into%20the%20church%20community)) ([The History of Truro Parish in Virginia – New River Notes](https://www.newrivernotes.com/the-history-of-truro-parish-in-virginia/#:~:text=white%20people%20and%20the%20other,%E2%80%9D)). And in 1862, when Union troops occupied the village, one of the churchyard's most tragic stories unfolded: Confederates caught a local white man, **John Read**, and executed him on The Falls Church lawn for the "crime" of educating enslaved people in secret during the war ([Historic Falls Church Dedicates 'Enslaved Persons' Plaque - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/02/12/historic-falls-church-dedicates-enslaved-persons-plaque/#:~:text=His%20dedication%20was%20preceded%20by,days%20of%20the%20Civil%20War)). Though this occurred in the Civil War, it underscores that *enslaved African Americans around The Falls Church were striving for literacy and spiritual knowledge* long before emancipation, even if their names are largely unrecorded. Oral histories collected by the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation suggest that enslaved workers from nearby plantations would surreptitiously gather in the woods (since they were relegated to the margins of the official parish) to practice faith on their own terms ([Transformed From a Colonial Town to a Popular D.C. Suburb, Falls ...](https://www.historynet.com/falls-church-virginia-civil-war-history/#:~:text=Transformed%20From%20a%20Colonial%20Town,the%20grove%20of%20trees)). 

In summary, through a patchwork of vestry minutes, wills, and court documents, we **recover at least a few names and narratives** of the enslaved people connected to The Falls Church: Nelly, Charles, Sarah, Piper, Kitty, Lilly, Will, Janney, and others. Each of these individuals had specific skills and roles – whether as field laborers, artisans, or domestic workers – that contributed to the **physical construction, ongoing maintenance, and social life** of the church and the colonial community around it. They tilled the fields that paid the parish levies, cut the timber and clay that became church walls, and served the families who filled the pews. Yet, in the written history of Falls Church, they received virtually no recognition until very recently.

## Broadening the Narrative: Memory and Historical Responsibility  
For most of the church's existence, local history celebrated its **esteemed founders and architectural heritage** while either glossing over or entirely omitting the enslaved people who made that heritage possible. Only in the 21st century has Falls Church begun to formally acknowledge this complex past. In 2017 – after research confirmed that *"skilled, but enslaved laborers had built the current Falls Church in 1769"* – the church installed a prominent plaque at its entrance expressing *"gratitude and repentance"* toward the enslaved individuals who helped construct it ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=match%20at%20L338%20enslaved%20laborers,was%20deemed%20not%20strong%20enough)) ([Historic Falls Church Dedicates 'Enslaved Persons' Plaque - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/02/12/historic-falls-church-dedicates-enslaved-persons-plaque/#:~:text=dedication%20of%20a%20new%20plaque,1700s)). The plaque's wording ("with gratitude and repentance we honor the enslaved people whose skill and labor helped build The Falls Church") was chosen to convey both appreciation for those long-forgotten workers and contrition for the injustice of their bondage ([Historic Falls Church Dedicates 'Enslaved Persons' Plaque - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2017/02/12/historic-falls-church-dedicates-enslaved-persons-plaque/#:~:text=In%20a%20solemn%20ceremony%20held,1700s)). This public act of remembrance directly challenges earlier narratives that spoke of The Falls Church only as a proud colonial relic of patriots and gentlemen. It forces current parishioners and residents to grapple with the fact that **enslaved Black lives are entwined with the church's foundation** in a very literal sense. 

In 2024, The Falls Church's own Archives Ministry published a comprehensive research report on the parish's ties to slavery, revealing that **between the 1730s and 1860s, the church's rectors and vestrymen collectively enslaved around 750 people** ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=New%20research%20concludes%20that%20rectors,between%20the%201730s%20and%201860s)). This astonishing number, spanning many generations of human lives, lays bare how deeply the institution was implicated in slavery. The research specifically identified clergy like Rev. Townsend Dade and families like the Masons, Gunnels, and Harrisons and tallied the individuals they held in bondage ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=New%20research%20concludes%20that%20rectors,between%20the%201730s%20and%201860s)). By quantifying the enslaved people "owned" by church leaders, the report reframes Falls Church's legacy: the success and prominence of the parish were built on an economic foundation of slave labor. Current church leaders have embraced this truth-telling as a form of moral reckoning. *"Acknowledging difficult truths about the long history of this parish"* is seen as a first step toward healing, as the rector wrote, and the congregation has been studying how to make amends or reparations ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=itself%2C%20complicated%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Fr,%E2%80%9D)) ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=The%20report%20includes%20a%20series,to%20racial%20justice%20and%20equality)). The **Episcopal Diocese of Virginia** has commended these efforts, linking them to a broader movement of racial reconciliation in historic churches ([TFC Ties to Slavery | FCE](https://www.thefallschurch.org/tiestoslavery#:~:text=The%20Right%20Reverend%20E,%E2%80%9D)). 

The wider Falls Church community is likewise debating how to remember (or even whether to continue honoring) the figures of the past who were slaveholders. In 2020, amid national conversations about race, the City of Falls Church renamed its high school, which had been **George Mason High School**, to a new name (Meridian High) in part because **George Mason**, though a Founding Father, was an enslaver on a massive scale ([Mason's Name is Removed from High School, But His Virginia ...](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/07/05/masons-name-is-removed-from-high-school-but-his-virginia-legacy-endures/#:~:text=Mason%27s%20Name%20is%20Removed%20from,my%20mind%20that%20he)). Some have even questioned the city's very name – "Falls Church" – arguing that a name drawn from an Anglican church built with slave labor implicitly glorifies a slave-era institution. A local citizens' group has advocated for renaming the city to "Little Falls" to break from that legacy ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=By%20confronting%20our%20history%20and,collective%20healing%2C%20understanding%2C%20and%20growth)). While controversial, such proposals underscore a growing awareness that the symbols and names from the slavery era carry weight. The Falls Church Episcopal itself has confronted this tension between pride in its heritage and repentance for its injustices. As one example, a prominent memorial plaque inside the church honors **Col. James Wren** as *"Architect and Builder of this church"* – but only recently have church tours begun to add that Wren's *actual builders* were enslaved people ([James Wren - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wren#:~:text=Wren%20died%20in%201815,Register%20of%20Historic%20Places)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=In%201769%2C%20architect%20James%20Wren,with%20the%20institution%20of%20slavery26)). 

By bringing forward the names and stories of individuals like Nelly and Charles, our understanding of Falls Church's history expands beyond the old celebratory narrative. We now see Falls Church not just as a quaint colonial village blessed by the presence of Washington or Mason, but as a place where **enslaved Africans and their descendants literally shaped the landscape**. Every brick in the 1769 sanctuary, every timber in the 1733 structure was placed by hands that labored in bondage. This reality complicates the straightforward tale of patriotism and piety with one of exploitation and human resilience. It also enriches it: knowing these names and roles allows the modern community to **honor the full story** – including the contributions of those who had been written out of it. Today, initiatives in the city (such as public history projects, renamed institutions, and partnerships with African American heritage organizations like the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation) are seeking to ensure that those *previously underdocumented individuals* are not forgotten again. Falls Church is, in a sense, undergoing a renaissance of memory, where the voices of the enslaved are finally being heard alongside the voices of the famous. This ongoing dialogue about memory and responsibility is challenging, but it has opened the door to a more honest and inclusive narrative of Falls Church's past – one that acknowledges that the "physical and social foundations" of the community were laid as much by **Nelly's endurance and Charles's craftsmanship** as by George Mason's ideas or James Wren's designs ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=The%20church's%20leaders%2C%20including%20Wren%2C,justifying%20slavery%20in%20the%20community)) ([History of Falls Church | Little Falls Movement](https://littlefallsva.com/history/#:~:text=By%20confronting%20our%20history%20and,collective%20healing%2C%20understanding%2C%20and%20growth)).

Ultimately, confronting these histories has been an act of redemption for the church and community. As the new plaque at The Falls Church declares, only with *gratitude* for the enslaved people's contributions and *repentance* for the wrongs done to them can Falls Church move forward. The research presented here – drawn from vestry books, wills, court cases, and local lore – is part of that truth-telling. By **naming the nameless** and illuminating their roles, we reshape Falls Church's collective memory. These findings deeply enrich the public narrative: they transform "the Falls Church" from merely an old building at a crossroads into a legacy of enslaved skill and sacrifice. In doing so, they challenge all of us to remember that our community was built by *all* of its people, enslaved and free, and to carry that understanding as we consider how to commemorate and tell our history in the future.
