# Carol L. DeLong (1930–2023): Falls Church’s Trailblazing Mayor

## Early Life and Transition to Public Service  
Carol L. DeLong combined a background in science with a passion for community. Born June 25, 1930, in Newark, New Jersey, she earned a Bachelor of Science from the New Jersey College for Women (now Douglass College at Rutgers) in 1952 and a Master’s in organic chemistry from Washington State University ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=DeLong%20was%20born%20on%20June,Witte%20and%20Edith%20Kraeuter%20Witte)). She met her husband, Chester “Chet” DeLong, in graduate school; they married in 1956 and settled in Falls Church in 1960 to raise their family ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=Bachelor%20of%20Science%20degree%20in,chemistry%20at%20Washington%20State%20University)). As a mother of three daughters, DeLong put her analytical mind and **“formidable organizational skills and attention to detail”** toward volunteer service while managing a busy household ([Carol Witte De Long  Obituary - Falls Church, VA](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/falls-church-va/carol-de-long-11575713#:~:text=While%20managing%20a%20busy%20household,young%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church)). Her entry into civic life began through her children’s schools: she served as president of the Madison School Parent-Teacher Association in 1969–70, channeling her leadership abilities into improving local education ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=While%20managing%20a%20busy%20household,young%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church)). This hands-on involvement in the community laid the groundwork for DeLong’s transition from chemist and parent to public servant.

## Breaking Barriers in Falls Church Government  
DeLong’s grassroots civic engagement soon led her into city governance. In 1971, she was appointed to the Falls Church Planning Commission, where she helped shape neighborhood development policies ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=of%20the%20then,Falls%20Church)). Building on that experience, she ran for City Council and won election in 1974, launching what would become a 16-year tenure on the council ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=She%20served%20as%20Madison%20School,Council%20terms%2C%20serving%20until%201990)). At a time when few women held high office in the region, DeLong quickly emerged as a leader. Her council colleagues selected her as **Vice Mayor from 1976 to 1980**, and in 1980 she made history when fellow council members unanimously elected her as Falls Church’s first female Mayor ([](https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HR241+pdf#:~:text=16%20City%20Council%20from%201974,and%20the%20Metropolitan%20Washington%20Council)) ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=Her%20Council%20colleagues%20chose%20her,was%20City%E2%80%99s%20first%20woman%20Mayor)). She would serve four consecutive two-year terms as mayor (1980–1988), breaking barriers for women in the City of Falls Church. During this period, DeLong was known for her steady, detail-oriented approach and **plain-spoken style**. “In nerve-racking public meetings,” one longtime colleague recalled, **“Carol’s unique blend of traits – keen intellect, plain-speaking manner, eye for detail, and humility – were on display consistently” ([CBC Tribute to F.C. Mayor Carol DeLong - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/21/cbc-tribute-to-f-c-mayor-carol-delong/#:~:text=In%20these%20nerve,%E2%80%93%20were%20on%20display%20consistently))**. These qualities helped her earn the respect of allies and skeptics alike, enabling her to build consensus on the Council and in the community. By the time she left the Council in 1990, DeLong had paved the way for future women in Falls Church politics through her example of confident, competent leadership ([](https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HR241+pdf#:~:text=16%20City%20Council%20from%201974,and%20the%20Metropolitan%20Washington%20Council)).

## Shaping a Growing City as Mayor  
As mayor throughout the 1980s, DeLong guided Falls Church through a period of significant growth and civic development. She believed in building a strong civic infrastructure for the young city (which had only gained independence in 1948) and worked to improve public facilities, transportation, and quality of life for residents. **Key accomplishments during her mayoralty included:** 

- **Modernizing City Hall:** Overseeing construction of the *City Hall East Wing* addition to expand the capacity of local government ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=During%20her%20tenure%20on%20City,and%20Haycock%20Rd)). This project ensured that the city’s administration could meet the needs of a growing population and was a visible symbol of Falls Church’s maturation.  
- **Expanding Parks and Trails:** Creating new public recreation space with the establishment of *Madison Park*, and championing the construction of the *Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD) Trail bridge* over West Broad Street ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=During%20her%20tenure%20on%20City,and%20Haycock%20Rd)). The pedestrian bridge bridged a busy intersection, connecting the popular W&OD bike trail and improving safety for cyclists and walkers.  
- **Revitalizing the Downtown Streetscape:** Leading streetscape improvements along West Broad Street (Route 7) between West Street and Haycock Road ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=During%20her%20tenure%20on%20City,and%20Haycock%20Rd)). Under DeLong’s watch, Falls Church’s “Main Street” received widened sidewalks, landscaping, and other upgrades to foster a more pedestrian-friendly, neighborhood-oriented downtown.  
- **Launching the Farmers Market:** Promoting the establishment of the Falls Church *Farmers Market*, which began under her administration and has since become a beloved weekly institution in the city ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=She%20promoted%20the%20establishment%20of,weekly%20institution%20in%20Falls%20Church)). DeLong recognized early on the value of a community market, both for fresh local produce and as a gathering place that would draw citizens together on Saturday mornings.  
- **Championing Housing and Social Services:** Advocating for affordable housing and support for vulnerable populations. She pushed for the Falls Church Housing Corporation’s purchase of 81 units at *Winter Hill Apartments* to preserve affordable homes for low-income seniors and people with disabilities ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=DeLong%20advocated%20for%20the%20Falls,elderly%20and%20people%20with%20disabilities)). She also fought to establish *Aurora House*, a residential counseling center for at-risk adolescent girls in the city ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=DeLong%20advocated%20for%20the%20Falls,elderly%20and%20people%20with%20disabilities)), reflecting her commitment to social welfare and youth in need.

Wells Building). As mayor in the 1980s, Carol DeLong oversaw an expansion of City Hall and other infrastructure upgrades ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=During%20her%20tenure%20on%20City,and%20Haycock%20Rd)).*  

Each of these projects left a lasting imprint on Falls Church’s physical or social landscape. From new parks and bridges to human services, DeLong’s tenure was marked by an emphasis on strengthening the community’s foundations. Longtime residents still enjoy amenities she helped put in place decades ago, like the vibrant farmers market and improved civic facilities, underscoring how her leadership shaped the city’s late-20th-century evolution.

## Leadership Style and Regional Impact  
DeLong’s influence extended beyond bricks-and-mortar improvements; she was equally impactful in regional planning and governance. While on the City Council, she represented Falls Church on the **Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC)** from 1976 to 1990 and served on the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments’ Transportation Planning Board ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=While%20on%20the%20City%20Council%2C,COG%20over%20transportation%20funding%20formulas)). In these roles she became a voice for Falls Church in crucial transportation decisions during the era of Metrorail expansion. Notably, DeLong chaired the regional Transportation Planning Board and was instrumental in brokering a long-sought compromise among Northern Virginia jurisdictions on transportation funding formulas ([Carol Witte De Long  Obituary - Falls Church, VA](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/falls-church-va/carol-de-long-11575713#:~:text=While%20on%20the%20City%20Council%2C,COG%20over%20transportation%20funding%20formulas)). That achievement helped set equitable funding for projects like Metrorail, ensuring smaller localities like Falls Church had their interests protected. Colleagues credit her ability to master details and her collaborative approach for this success. She skillfully navigated regional politics with the same pragmatism she brought to City Hall, proving that Falls Church, despite its small size, could punch above its weight in metropolitan affairs. **“Falls Church has been richly served”** by leaders like DeLong who engage beyond the city’s borders, she once noted, emphasizing her belief in working together with neighboring communities for the common good ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=While%20on%20the%20City%20Council%2C,COG%20over%20transportation%20funding%20formulas)). Her legacy in this arena is evident in the efficient transit options and regional cooperation that Northern Virginia enjoys today, partly thanks to groundwork laid by DeLong’s tenure on those transportation bodies.

## Legacy of Service and Mentorship  
Even after retiring from elected office in 1990, Carol DeLong’s dedication to Falls Church did not wane. She remained a guiding presence in civic life for another three decades, often acting as a mentor and elder stateswoman for the community. DeLong was a longtime leader in the nonpartisan civic group **Citizens for a Better City (CBC)** – the organization under whose banner she had run for office – and even served as CBC president in later years ([CBC Tribute to F.C. Mayor Carol DeLong - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/21/cbc-tribute-to-f-c-mayor-carol-delong/#:~:text=Reflecting%20these%20traits%2C%20her%20character%2C,Dexter%20Award%2C%20CBC%E2%80%99s%20highest%20honor)). In 2002, CBC honored her with its highest award, the Jane and Wayne Dexter Award, recognizing her *“extraordinary record of sustained achievement”* and service ([CBC Tribute to F.C. Mayor Carol DeLong - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/21/cbc-tribute-to-f-c-mayor-carol-delong/#:~:text=Reflecting%20these%20traits%2C%20her%20character%2C,Dexter%20Award%2C%20CBC%E2%80%99s%20highest%20honor)). Hal Lippman, current CBC president, described DeLong as **“a beacon and embodiment of our cherished principles of citizen engagement and effective, responsive, accountable local government”**, calling hers *“a life well-lived”* whose effects will endure ([CBC Tribute to F.C. Mayor Carol DeLong - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/21/cbc-tribute-to-f-c-mayor-carol-delong/#:~:text=In%20sum%2C%20while%20our%20sadness,engagement%20and%20effective%2Fresponsive%2Faccountable%20local%20government)). Those who worked with her consistently highlight her humility, integrity, and devotion to inclusive governance.

DeLong helped launch the market, fostering a new tradition of community gathering ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C.

DeLong also used her platform to lift up other women in local government. In 1999, she received the Falls Church **Mattie Gundry Award** for *“furthering the standing of women in the community,”* a testament to her role in encouraging women’s civic participation ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=In%201999%20she%20received%20the,Falls%20Church%20Commission%20on%20Women)). She was active in the League of Women Voters and the Village Preservation and Improvement Society, and in 2021 – well into her 90s – she served as an honorary grand marshal for Falls Church’s first annual Women’s History Walk ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=In%201999%20she%20received%20the,Falls%20Church%20Commission%20on%20Women)). By proudly stepping into leadership and then actively celebrating other women’s contributions, DeLong inspired younger generations to engage in public service. Several local female officials who followed in her footsteps have noted that seeing a woman capably lead the city in the 1980s made their own paths easier. Her willingness to mentor up-and-coming community leaders (including family – her son-in-law Phil Duncan currently serves on the City Council ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=DeLong%2C%20a%20civic%20activist%20for,C%2C%20City%20Coincil))) showed her commitment to cultivating effective leadership beyond her own tenure.

Carol DeLong’s passing on December 9, 2023 marked the end of an era for Falls Church ([Former 4-Term & First WomanMayor of F.C. Carol DeLong Dies at 93 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/10/former-4-term-first-womanmayor-of-f-c-carol-delong-dies-at-93/#:~:text=Sunday%2C%20Dec.%2010%20%E2%80%94,9%2C%202023)). But the legacy she leaves is profound. City and state leaders remembered her as a *“trailblazing civic leader”* whose dedication left a **“profound and lasting impact”** on Falls Church ([](https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HR241+pdf#:~:text=33%20RESOLVED%2C%20That%20the%20House,Falls%20Church%3B%20and%2C%20be%20it)). From the **City Hall** that expanded under her watch, to the **farmer’s market and parks** that enliven the community, to the many protégés she encouraged, DeLong’s influence is woven into the fabric of the city. In every sense, Carol L. DeLong lived a life of purpose and service, and Falls Church today is a stronger, more vibrant “Little City” because of her decades of visionary leadership and civic devotion. Her story continues to inspire, reminding us that engaged local leadership can shape a community for generations ([CBC Tribute to F.C. Mayor Carol DeLong - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/12/21/cbc-tribute-to-f-c-mayor-carol-delong/#:~:text=In%20sum%2C%20while%20our%20sadness,engagement%20and%20effective%2Fresponsive%2Faccountable%20local%20government)).
