# Native Inhabitants and Early Development

When Englishmen first came to the site of Fairfax County, the Algonquin inhabitants of the area were of the Necostin (or Anacostin) and Dogue (or Toag or Taux) tribes. The Necostins lived at the mouth of the Anacostia River on the Maryland side and along the Virginia shore and Analostan Island (Theodore Roosevelt Island). The Dogues lived on Mason Neck and the Maryland shore of the Potomac. Both tribes were part of the Powhatan Chiefdom which in earlier years had gathered most of the Virginia Tidewater and Piedmont Indians into a loose alliance. By the seventeenth century, however, the tribes in the Potomac region were gradually pulling away in favor of alliances with the Iroquois nations of the north.

Indian life flourished along the river and the many small streams. The Indians of the Potomac Tidewater were fishermen and corn growers. Their tools were made of stone, wood, bone, and fiber. Throughout Northern Virginia, the sites of Indian villages and hunting camps still can be found, generally near streams or outcrops of flint or quarts or deposits of pottery clay. They offer abundant evidence of the Indian presence.

Throughout the seventeenth century, the virgin forest that covered the Piedmont and the Appalachian mountains was the historic hunting preserve of the Iroquois Nations, and their war parties held the Tidewater Indians in fearful respect. And even the English traders and settlers, anxious though they were to expand westward, would not venture into the forests and highlands of the Iroquois hunting grounds. Thus, the Englishmen of 1720 were almost as ignorant of what was beyond the Blue Ridge as Captain John Smith had been in his day (Harrison, Landmarks). *Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution*

# The Patowmack Canal

George Washington and his neighbors who were interested in developing western lands actively promoted the idea of constructing a canal around the Great Falls. In 1785 they organized the Patowmack Company to undertake this pioneering project. Work began on the locks at Great Falls in 1793 and by 1802 the entire series of canals and locks was substantially complete. President John Adams presided at the opening of the canal for navigation in 1802. Down the river, through the locks, and on to Georgetown and Alexandria came cargoes of furs, flour, whiskey, and lumber packed in flat-bottomed barges called gondolas.

# The Chain Bridge

The importance of having a bridge across the Potomac at the Little Falls was recognized early, and in 1797 the first bridge at that point was built by the Georgetown Potomac Bridge Company. It was a covered wooden structure designed by Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Massachusetts. A combination of weathering and heavy loads caused its collapse in 1804. Another one was immediately constructed, using wooden arches carried by a wooden truss, but within six months it was carried away.

The original Chain Bridge, shown here, was the third bridge built at that site. It was designed so that its 128-foot deck of oak planks was suspended from chains made of four-and-a-half foot links anchored in massive stone abutments, based on a design patented by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. This bridge lasted until 1852, and it was an essential link in the road system by which wagon transports and herds of animals moved from the Shenandoah Valley to the auction houses of Georgetown in the first half of the nineteenth century. *Drawing about 1805; courtesy of United States Commission on Fine Arts*

# Civil War in Fairfax County

As Union troops occupied Alexandria and the northern part of Fairfax County, and Confederate units formed in the western and southern parts, civilian life was a victim of the confusion and speed with which events moved. Outside the areas guarded by Federal troops, pockets of Union sympathizers were harassed by secessionists and driven from their homes.

In areas occupied by the Federals, civilians suspected of secession political activity or spying were arrested. The drawing above from Harper's Weekly shows "the Misses Scott" and their father being escorted to prison in Washington and illustrates the fate of many civilians suspected of rebel activity (Steadman, Falls Church). *Courtesy of Melvin L. Steadman*

Within days after Virginia seceded, Union troops occupied strategic hills and crossroads in Fairfax County to protect the city of Washington. Eventually an extensive system of fortifications was built along a large arc stretching from south of Alexandria up to Chain Bridge.

In the summer of 1861 the crossroads community of Falls Church marked the outer rim of the territory occupied by the Union defenders. Shown here are Union cavalry pickets at The Falls Church. *Courtesy of Falls Church Historical Commission*

During the summer and fall of 1861, McClellan organized, trained, and drilled the new Army of the Potomac. Parades and inspections were held regularly, and led one Pennsylvanian to write home: "When the Major or Brigadier General are favored with the visits of some particular friends of course a big parade must [be held]." This is as necessary as dessert is.

1861 exceeded all others. That day in the fields between Munson's Hill and Bailey's Crossroads approximately 100,000 men passed in review for McClellan, President Lincoln, and other distinguished visitors from Washington.

Later one enlisted man from Massachusetts declared: "This is a day long to be remembered by thousands of people as one [on] the 'sacred soil' of Virginia."

These parades, as well as the other training, gave the new soldiers and officers a chance to assess each other's qualities, sort out the misfits, and develop an esprit de corps that had been missing before. There also were opportunities for small units to patrol and probe the strength of the nearby Confederate [forces].

## Military Technology and Innovation

The Civil War saw the introduction of new military technologies, including aerial reconnaissance. In Fairfax County, Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe, Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, conducted several observation balloon missions to gather intelligence on Confederate positions. The balloon "Intrepid," shown here during an ascension near Vienna, Virginia, allowed Union commanders to observe troop movements and fortifications from heights of up to 1,000 feet. 

These balloons represented the first military aeronautical unit in American history and provided the Union Army with a significant tactical advantage in the early stages of the war. Vienna, where this ascension took place, was strategically important due to its location on the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad and had been the site of one of the war's earliest skirmishes in June 1861.
