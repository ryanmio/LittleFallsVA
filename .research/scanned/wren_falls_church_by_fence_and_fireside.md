# Wren Bio on Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside
## The Big Chimney Tours

## Source Information
This document captures content from Tony P. Wren's biographical work on Falls Church history, specifically focusing on the "By Fence and Fireside" themes as related through the lens of the Big Chimney landmark and associated tours.

## Description
This work appears to be Wren's exploration of Falls Church history through a series of "tours" centered around the Big Chimney, a significant local landmark. The "By Fence and Fireside" subtitle suggests an intimate approach to history-telling, collecting stories shared across neighborhood fences and around home firesides. The work likely combines architectural history with oral traditions and community memories.

Jonathan Lovett, a Quaker Surveyor of Loudoun County, made a map, in Sep-ember 1801, showing the roads from Winchester to Alexandria. When he arrived at Falls Church, he gave it another name: "Col. James Wrens." At that time Wren was not only one of the most prominent citizens of the area, but Wren's Ordinary (Tavern) was a noted stopping place, recommended by Thomas Jefferson.?
Lovett noted that the distance from Winchester to Colonel Wren's was 66 miles, 2 quarters and 36½ perches. It was 4 miles, 2 quarters and 52 perches from "Old Court House' (Tyson's Corner) to Wren's; and 4 miles, 2 quarters, and 73 perches from Wren's to the "Forks of the Road on the levels" (now Bailey's Cross Roads).
Very little has been written about Colonel James Wren. His connection with the life of Falls Church and Northern Virginia is yet to find its place on the printed page.
Any man is a product of his family environment. This is especially true of Colonel Wren, for good architecture was in his blood, as the old folks used to say. His roots include Sir Christopher Wren, distinguished English Architect.
The earliest known ancestor of Sir Christopher Wren was one Cuthbert Wren, who died in 1558. He was a haberdasher with a corner stall "next unto Cheap-Crosse." His ancestors came from Denmark and settled in County Durham, England, in the 15th Century. Cuthbert Wren settled at Monk's Kirby, Warwickshire. The name is found in old records as Wren, Wrenn, and Wrenne. Present day descendants in Virginia use Wren and Wrenn, the latter being most popular.
Francis Wren (1553-1624), a son of Cuthbert Wren,' was a London Mercer. By his wife, Susan, he had at least three children: Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely; Susan Wren, married William Holder the mathematician; and the Rev. Christopher Wren, father of Sir Christopher Wren.
John Wren's name appeared on the Tax List made in 1782 by Josiah Watson in Fairfax County. At that time he paid tithe on eleven whites and six slaves.» He appears on the Loudoun County Tithe List in 1783 with John Urton, Overseer, and paid for three Negroes (five tithes in all). In 1786 he paid in Loudoun County for himself and Negroes: James, Peter, and Frank, 28
There is also a record in Loudoun County of Samuel Chun being apprenticed to
John Wren:29
"I do hereby Certifie that Mary Chun the Mother of Samuel Chun is willing that he shall be bound to John Wren of Loudon County to learn the trade of a carpenter, he is twelve years old the nineteenth day of March Next 1785. James Wren.
On July 29, 1793, Gray Douglass conveyed a wagon and team and other items to John and Thomas Wren. Merchants, of Loudoun County (Witness: Simon Triplett).
On September 8, 1795, Wren, and wife Hannah, then of Fauquier County, sold to Francis Harriman of Loudoun County, for 200 pounds, the same tract sold Samuel Dorsey Harriman in 1792. The deed recites that the land was sold by Court decree and repurchased by Wren. The land is here further described as being on the northeast side of the main road leading from Leesburg to Alexandria. This deed made an exception of one acre which Wren sold to Colonel Thomas Ludwell Lee. Witnesses were: John Littlejohn, Benjamin Edwards, and John Fry.30 On February 11, 1796, John and Hannah Wren sold to Colonel Thomas Ludwell Lee one acre on Goose Creek for a mill. On August 17, 1793, Samuel Dorsey Harriman had made a deed to Lee, but later died without fully paying Wren who reclaimed the property. Witnesses were: Charles Binns, Jr., Thomas Swann, and William A. Harding.31 On October 26, 1793, Mrs. Jane Carter, Landon Carter, Jr., and Robert Carter of Bull Run, and others, sold to John Wren, then of Fauquier County, a tract of 277 acres of land on Goose Creek.

The lease was made for the life time of John Wren, his wife Hannah, and son James Wren. 32 Witnesses were: John McEndree, George McKenny, and William DeBell On May 13, 1800,33 Landon Carter, Jr., and Robert Carter of Bull Run,

(13) (Colonel) James Wren, the Architect of Falls Church, was born about 1728. a son of John Wren (1) and Ann (Turner) Wren. He died at his Falls Church home
*Long View," in 1815. Colonel Wren established a large plantation, "Winter Hill" on that tract which includes the present site of Dulin Methodist Church. His mansion house was on the site of the present-day Ankers House in the 300 block of East Broad Street. The Birch home at 312 East Broad Street was an early building on the
"Winter Hill" tract.
The first record of Colonel Wren is on a Poll (nature not indicated), one of many names, January 10, 1751 (King George County, Deed Book 3, page 469). He is listed thus: "James Wren-107." On May 17, 1753, there is a record, an Indenture of Ap-prentice, between David Bronaugh and Thomas Bronaugh (cousin of said David) both of King George, and James Wren, also of King George. The said David Bro-naugh apprenticed the said Thomas Bronaugh to Wren, to be taught the "trade Suince (Science) or Occupation of a Carpenter and Joiner." Recorded September 6, 1753.67
On October 2, 1755, Thomas Wren was bound to James Wren, as an apprentice, until age 21 years, to learn the trade of "Joiner and Carpenter."6s On July 6, 1758, Kilby (Kilbree) Wren, son of John Wren, late of Hanover Parish, ing George County, and James Wren, of Truro Parish, Fairfax County, joined in ndenture of Apprentice. Kilbree Wren was apprenticed to James Wren, "to be ht the trade science or occupation of a Joiner & Carpenter which he the said es Wren now useth .. " for five wears. The signature of Kilbree Wren gives the frect spelling of his name. Witnesses were: Nathaniel Harrison, Thomas Bro-naugh, and William Brent. 69
On October 4, 1758, there is a deed of record between James Wren and William Wren of Hanover Parish, King George, to Zaccheus Wharton, for 60 acres (corner to Thomas Turner). This has already been given in detail.
John Wren, with the approbation of the Court, bound himself to James Wren on April 7, 1763, to "Learn the Trade of a Carpenter and Joiner." This, too, is detailed
elsewhere.
The first reference to Colonel James Wren in the Fairfax County land records is a deed dated June 15, 1756, in which James Scott conveyed to Wren (then of Truro Parish) the land Wren was living upon. The land is described as 200 acres adjacent to John and Gerrard Trammell. James Wren, Catherine Wren, and their son. Charles

Mrs. Wren was dines in stalford County on January 13, 1729, a daughter of Charles and Hannah (Innes.
Brent 7 Her father, Charles Brent, made his will in Overwharton Parish, Staftos, Brenty, on August 28, 1755, and this was probated April 13, 3756. In the will he mentions his children: Charles Brent, Hugh Brent, William Brent, George Brent, ment Brent, Ann Brent, Catherine Wren, and his wife, Hannah Brent. He also mentions his friend and neighbor, Peter Daniel. Brent left his daughter, Catherine Wren. three Negroes: Sarah, Moll, and Hannah; also one equal part of all his household goods and stock, "including what she hath already received to be part of the same." Witnesses to the will were: John Anderson, Clement Cheverel, Mary Cheverel, Sarah Daniel, and Mary Carter.
About 1771/74, Colonel Wren remarried (no record available). Colonel Wren married (third) in Alexandria, D.C., on March 4, 1804, to Sarah Jones?* George Deneale was Bondsman at the time of this marriage.
Colonel Wren was listed as a Vestryman and Church Warden for Fairfax Parish on December 20, 1769. His election to the Vestry was on November 15, 1766, to replace Edward Blackburn, a former Vestryman. This election serves as additional evidence of his loyalty and interest in the Anglican Church. As noted earlier, Wren designed Falls Church and built it. His plan was also used in Christ Church at Alex-andria, and Pohick Church.
Although Wren was the Architect of Christ Church, it was built by James Parsons.
Wren did, however, letter tablets on either side of the "three windows," and the chancel of Christ Church, for which he was paid 8 pounds in 1773. The bricks for the Falls Church were burned in his brick kiln on Shreve Road, near "Long View," which tradition states he owned in proprietorship with his brother, William Wren.
As an Architect, Wren had been influenced by works in print in his day, and its thought by this writer that he may have come under the influence of William Buck land who designed George Mason's "Gunston Hall." In 1759 Buckland completed work on the Truro Parish Glebe which much later (under provision of the Act of
1802), was purchased by Wren. S
Colonel Wren was Commissioner of Provisional Law for Fairfax County durin the Revolutionary War, and the D.A.R. records also call him an Artificer and Sot dier. Certificates are on file in the Virginia State Library at Richmond (under Public Claims) showing that Wren received rye "for the use of the army," from his son.
James Wren, Jr., on October 16, 1780. He signed both certificates under this dale as "Jas. Wren, Commissioner." Wren was appointed Lieuterant of the Fairfax Counts Militia and took Oath April 16, 1787.76 It is known that he held the commission of Captain during the early part of the Revolutionary Conflict. Samuel Barker Dark in his deposition made February 2, 1833,7, states that he unfistedin Fairtax Count
on July 10, 1775, under Captain James Wren, and took part in the defense of Alex.
Wren purchased several tracts of land in the Falls Church area as he extended his interests in social and political affairs. He must have been a well educated man, with 1 good business sense, judging from the following extract of a letter he wrote from Winter Hill on November S, 1797, to his son-in-law, Simon Adams:
"Mr. Talbot (another son-in-law) informs me that you are selling goods fast, but must remind you that selling is one part of the business and receiving is another, and you had but a small capital to begin with, so that in the end you may find it a disagreeable business if you are not very cautious who you trade with. I cant help but remind you of old John Muir's opinion 'that a man had better cry over his goods than after them." "
Wren owned land in Loudoun County, and the Tithe List for 1780 (page four) gives reference to the Quarter owned by Colonel James Wren "of Fairfax" and he paid four tithes, on John Hubbard (probably his Overseer) and three Negroes: Jack, Mary, and Winny. The Tithe List for Loudoun County (1782, Part I), gives this information: "Colo. James Renn (Fairfax), David Allen, Overseer." Negroes named Jack, Moll, and Winny were living at this "Quarter" tract in Loudoun in 1782. He paid six tithes in 1785, and John Win (Winn) is listed as Overseer. Apparently this land was the 200 acre tract in Cameron Parish (near the Fairfax border) on Difficult Run, which he purchased on February 21, 1774.78 The deed of that date was from Benjamin Cockrill of Loudoun to James Wren of Fairfax, in consideration of
80 Pounds, current money. Witnesses to the deed were Robert H. Harrison, Bailey Donaldson, Edward Dulin, Philip Adams, William Elley, William Gunnell, and William Payne.
On May 28, 1787, James and Mary Hurst conveyed to James Wren land in Fairfax County on Four Mile Run. Boundaries included: Pearson, Harrison & Reagan Trammell, and along the Run to Gunnell's corner (on the North side of the Run).
This tract contained 145 acres, 35 perches, and was originally granted to George Harrison. Witnesses were: George Minor, Henry Darne, and Thomas Grafford. 19
On February 23, 1788, James Wren, Gentleman, took oath as a Commissioner of Tax for Fairfax County, and his Bond was countersigned by Colonel George Minor.80 He was appointed Sheriff of Fairfax County by Governor Henry Lee, and his Commission was dated November 13, 1792. His Bond in the amount of 20,000 pounds current money was dated November 19, 1792, and addressed to the Gentleman Justices of Fairfax County: David Stuart, William Herbert, and Richard Conway.
The Bond was countersigned by: Benjamin Dulaney, William Payne, George Minor, and R

deline else is known of Colonel James Wren, excepting that he served as a Justice
of the Peace of Fairfax County, and was a Trustee of the stillborn Town of Turber ville, laid off near the Little Falls of the Potomac in 1798.
The only house owned and lived in by James Wren, which is standing,"
* is "Long
View" on Shreve Road. This house was erected in 1770, and became his home after his second marriage. His son, John Wren, later lived at "Long View" after the death of his step-mother. "Long View" has changed little over the years. The original front was from what is now the Lee Highway area, and the house was approached by an avenue of cedar trees. The family cemetery was to the left of the entrance.
Stones which were standing as late as 1949 have disappeared, but twelve graves with dornick stones are still to be seen. A twisted piece of box, burned many times, but still coming back, marks the grave of Colonel Wren. Also buried in the cemetery are Mrs. Robert Reid and children, Sarah (Jones) Wren, members of the family of John Wren, and also descendants of Robert and Verlinda (Wren) Darne.$6 Mr. John Robert Darne (always known as "Jack" Darne), was the last member of the Wren family buried there. Mr. Darne was a great-grandson of Colonel James Wren. "Long View" is now the home of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bretschneider.
One of the last records made by Colonel Wren was a deed in connection with the final settlement and sale of the old Glebe of Fairfax Parish, made a few months before his death. At that time, April 25, 1815, Wren was too feeble to sign his name. and signed with an "x.

Wren also loaned her the use of Charles the blacksmith and his tools for three years f he lives so long and at the expiration of that time to be given up and his tools to his wife Sarah Piper not as a slave but as her husband."s Wren also loaned to his wife all the fowls on the home plantation, and directed that she not rent "out any part of the land nor suffer any waste of the timber to be done on the land.
" He direct-
ed also that the land was to belong to his son, John Wren, following the death of his wife, and that her estate which he received at the time of marriage, "be given up to her or her heirs at my death agreeable to Contract by my Executors." Wren gave his son, James Wren, his watch and all his "wearing apparrell," his riding Saddle, and three Negroes (already in his son's possession): Nelly, Kitty, and Lilly. To his daughter, Hannah Adams, he gave three Negroes, Sall (and her two children, lone and Hamon) already in Hannah's possession, and also $200 out of his estate. Wren gave his daughter Mary Dulin two Negroes, Milly and Anna and their increase, these Negroes already owned by Mary, and also $200. Daughter "Catey" Adams during her life was to have right and title "to a small tract of land lying and being in the state of Kentucky, Shelby County," and was loaned three Negroes "which is in her possession named Sarah, Maryann and Reubin," which after her death were to belong to William Adams, her son. Another daughter, Sarah Talbott, was given Negroes Lewes and Anny, already in her possession, and $200.
The main provision of the will was for John Wren, who apparently received more than his brother James. It may be, however, that Colonel Wren provided for James, Jr., during his lifetime. John Wren was to receive the home plantation and all items uned" his step-mother during her life, also "the tract of land I purchased of Mr. as Hurst Except one quarter of an acre I gave to the Methodist Society to build r Church on-likewise one tract of Land I took up adjoining Benjamin Dulany

He also left John two Negroes, John and Julet, already in John's possession, and by a codicil of December 28, 1810, gave him a tract of land purchased from Andrew Rounsaville containing eleven and three quarters acres.
Wren also provided for the heirs of his daughter Betty Hughes, giving her children "Two Negroes named Will and Tonney that I let William Hughes have in the Spring (of) 1806 and at his death they and Jeneys Increase to be equally divided amongst her (Betty's) children.

## Historical Context
The "Big Chimney" referenced in this work was likely a prominent local landmark that served as a geographical and historical anchor point for the community. Using landmark-based "tours" as a narrative device was a common approach in local histories of the mid-20th century, allowing writers to create a physical journey through both place and time.

The "By Fence and Fireside" approach connects to the long tradition of oral history in American communities, recognizing that much of what we know about local history comes not from formal documents but from stories passed between neighbors and generations. This work appears to attempt to preserve these informal histories before they were lost to time.
