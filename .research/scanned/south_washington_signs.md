The Story of Falls Church
The community located just 10 miles from the nation’s capital and today known as Falls Church
boasts a history rich in culture and diversity.

The People to 1700
Native Peoples and Their Land

For thousands of years, native peoples lived in the Falls Church vicinity including a tribe called the
Dogue near the Potomac River. They were aligned with the Powhatan Confederacy, led by Chief
Powhatan (Wahunsenacawh), father of Pocahontas (Matoaka). The people in this area grew corn,
beans, squash and tobacco, collected wild plants, and fished for sturgeon and other migratory
species. They hunted deer, bison, bears, wild turkey, small game and birds. They traded with other
tribes and later, settlers, traveling via waterways and connecting trails, which were the earliest
routes and became integral to the region’s history.
European Colonists
By the late 1600s, increasing hostility and conflict
caused by European settlement drove the native
peoples from their traditional lifestyle and lands. Some
assimilated into the community. Many moved and
settled in other locations. The Europeans used the
same water routes and the extensive trail system
established by the natives as their basic means of
travel, commerce and settlement. The newcomers first
settled near the larger rivers and creeks. A log cabin
with two large brick chimneys was likely built in Falls
Church in 1699 by an independent farmer. Known as
“Big Chimneys,” the house was the first known
European structure in the area. It stood until the early
20th century near today’s Big Chimneys Park, located at
Annandale Road and Maple Avenue.

Africans In Virginia
In August of 1619, a British ship sailing under a Dutch
flag brought the first Africans to North America.
Originally captured by Portuguese traders and held in
Angola, roughly twenty Africans, from west-central
Africa, were forcibly abducted and transported to what
is now Hampton, Virginia. The tragedy of the
transatlantic slave trade continued for centuries. Early
records of Falls Church and nearby areas document
that both free men and women of color and enslaved
people of African descent were part of the Village of
Falls Church as early as the mid-1700s. These early
African Americans were skilled in farming, weaving,
metalwork and other crafts, making them valuable
contributors to the local economy.

Tobacco and the Early Economy

Native people introduced tobacco to the Europeans soon
after their 1607 settlement in Jamestown, Virginia. As the
English tried various means to sustain their new colony,
the plant became a popular cash crop. Tobacco was used
as currency to pay taxes collected by local churches.
Cutting, curing and transporting tobacco for shipment was
labor intensive, fueling the transport and sale of enslaved
African people as field workers. Away from the rivers,
“rolling roads” of wood slabs allowed large barrels or
casks called hogsheads to be pulled by oxen to the
warehouses, inspectors and ports. Enslaved Africans and
indentured Europeans often built the ox roads that were
used throughout the area. A historic sign on Annandale
Road marks the remains of one such road.

The Falls Church and Community

Most Virginia colonists were members of the Church of England, also known as the Anglican or
Episcopal Church. In 1724, the first church in the area was established near the Potomac River at
Pohick, followed in 1734 by a second church near the Potomac River Falls, soon known as “The
Falls Church.” In 1748, the influential George Mason was named a vestryman, and in 1762, 30year-old George Washington was also named to the vestry. Washington and his neighbor George
William Fairfax led efforts to replace the wood structure. The current church, built between 17671769, was designed by James Wren. Both churches were likely built with enslaved labor. The
church that gave the City of Falls Church its name was the center of local life and served as a
Revolutionary War recruiting station. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read from its
steps.
Near the Nation’s Capital
The history of Falls Church has close ties to the nation’s capital. After the American Revolution, a
capital city was planned along the Potomac River, near the home of George Washington. Major
Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker, a free African American mathematician and astronomer,
surveyed the boundary in 1791, placing the west corner stone for the District of Columbia on
Meridian Street. A second stone stands on what is now Van Buren Street. During the War of 1812
with the British, American gunpowder and arms were moved from Washington to the Dulany family
farm in Falls Church for safe keeping. President James Madison and his wife traveled separately on
congested local roads to escape the burning of Washington by British troops. Dolly Madison’s
carriages held the White House silver and George Washington’s portrait, saved with help from Paul
Jennings, an enslaved servant. President Madison stayed at Wren’s Tavern in Falls Church.

Virginia Village 1815-1861
Turnpikes and Tolls
Falls Church’s location was not only close to the
nation’s capital, it was also an important stop along
the route from Alexandria’s port on the Potomac
River to Leesburg and the western mountains. The
Leesburg Turnpike Company was established by
the Virginia General Assembly in 1809 to construct
a road from Leesburg to “a point on the Little River
Turnpike” to improve travel and commerce. In 1818,
merchants in Washington City won the right to
connect a second pike to Georgetown via the
present-day Chain Bridge. The Leesburg Turnpike –
now State Route 7 – was later paved through Falls
Church, and finally opened in 1838. One of its six
toll gates was built in Falls Church near Wren’s
Tavern.

The Village Grows
By the 1830s, Falls Church was a growing,
prosperous village, a marketplace and a service
stop for travelers. Blacksmiths and wheelwrights
were numerous, and by 1828, Falls Church was
home to five inns and ordinaries, including Wren’s
Tavern, dating to circa 1785. Providing food, drink
and lodging, the inns and taverns were centers of
political discussions and social gatherings. The
village became a hub for commerce, with farms and
orchards providing produce for the local market,

Alexandria and Washington City. Northerners
attracted by the cheap farmland and warmer climate moved to the area. Cherry Hill Farmhouse
(1845), the Lawton House (1854), the Birch House (1840s), and several other homes built along the
turnpike still stand today. Better roads also improved regional communication, earning Falls Church
a post office, located in the Star Tavern.
Church and Community
From its earliest days, Falls Church has been a welcoming place for people of many beliefs.
In the 1770s, Methodist church members established the Fairfax Chapel (site is in Oakwood
Cemetery). Bishop Francis Asbury, founding father of the American Methodist Church, and Harry
Hoosier, the first African American Methodist minister, visited Falls Church often. By the 1800s,
Methodists replaced the Anglicans as the area’s largest congregation. During these years,
Presbyterians met in private homes. The Civil War brought many changes to the village, including
damages to The Falls Church and the destruction of Fairfax Chapel. Columbia Baptist Church,
established in 1856, allowed people of color to worship in the balcony. Abolitionist leaders
encouraged the establishment of the African American Galloway Methodist Church (1867) and the
Second Baptist Church (1871). The war split the Methodists into separate Southern and Northern
congregations. St. James Catholic Church began in 1874, followed by the Congregational Church in
1885.

National politics influenced Falls Church. In 1858, Harriet Foote Turner, a local free woman of color,
led 12 enslaved people to freedom in Canada by posing as their owner. In the 1860 Presidential
election, some residents voted for Abraham Lincoln, rare in Virginia. During the 1861 referendum to
leave the Union, more than a third of the local citizens voted secession despite intimidation. After
Virginia joined the Confederacy and Union troops “invaded” the commonwealth, friends and
neighbors were forced to choose sides. Black and white Union supporters formed a local Home
Guard. Some African Americans joined the U.S. Colored Troops. In June 1861, Thaddeus Lowe
used a hot air balloon to report Confederate troop movements in Falls Church, the first such U.S.
military use. In November 1861, Julia Ward Howe was inspired by a visit to Union Army camps near
Falls Church to write the words to the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”

Falls Church lay just outside a line of forts protecting the Union capital. In July 1861, thousands of
Union soldiers marched through the village to engage Confederate forces who won the first battle at
Manassas along Bull Run. Seeing so many Union soldiers retreating in disarray through the village
unnerved some residents, who quickly fled. Roughly 20,000 Confederate troops occupied Falls
Church for the rest of the summer. In late September, the Confederates pulled out, and Union
troops regained control of the area. After a second battle at Manassas in August 1862 and the
September battle at Antietam, Maryland, hundreds of wounded and sick soldiers were brought to
makeshift hospitals in churches and barns. Tent camps sprouted up and fences became fuel for
campfires. The graveyard at the Falls Church became the final resting place of soldiers from both
sides.
Fear and Resistance
The Union Army occupied Falls Church from fall 1861 to the end of the war, but
residents also feared Confederate partisans. By 1864, Confederate Col. John
Singleton Mosby’s Raiders were actively staging night raids while an interracial
Home Guard of Civilians kept watch over the village. On October 2, 1864, 75
Raiders rode down the turnpike after dark, killing two Home Guard members,
including freedman Frank Brooks, a free African American. They took two
captives, including John Read, an abolitionist Home Guard member who with

Church residents suffered losses of buildings, fences, livestock, crops and other
property. After the war, the Southern Claims Commission processed requests for
payment of damages to Union loyalists including several free African American families.

Coming of the Railroad

Railroads began to spread across the eastern seaboard in the 1830s, providing fast and reliable
transportation for goods and passengers. The local railroad received its charter in 1847, and by
May of 1860, trains ran between Alexandria and Leesburg, including a station at West Falls Church.
A trip that required a half-day’s journey by horse took only 35 minutes by train and cost 50 cents.
The line closed during the Civil War and later reopened, with a second local station built at East
Falls Church in 1870. The line was renamed the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. The
W&OD ceased operations in 1968 and its right-of-way is now a recreational trail stretching 45 miles
from the Potomac River to Purcellville, Virginia.
Reconstruction and the Town
Following the Civil War, black and white residents rebuilt their lives.
Many who fled during the war returned, and newcomers arrived seeking
cheap land, a better climate and government jobs. African Americans
created a thriving community by purchasing land despite price gouging,
successfully fighting for and gaining municipal services to establish
businesses and churches. Through the leadership of Joseph Riley, the
Town of Falls Church was incorporated in 1875, enabling local control
of taxes, roads and schools. A school for white children was built in
1882, but the Falls Church Colored School was not built until 1888, and
then only after a determined appeal by African American civic leaders.
Frederick Foote Jr., a respected black merchant, was elected to the
town council for four terms (1880-1889). One year later, the town
council voted to eliminate the influence of black voters by giving up onethird of the town to Fairfax County.

The late 1800s was a time of modernization.
The center of town was made up of thriving
businesses owned by black and white residents
and patronized by all. During this period, Village
Improvement Societies (VIS) were formed in
many places, including Falls Church in 1885.
The community celebrated the first Arbor Day in
Virginia in 1892, prompting residents to plant a
canopy of trees along paved roads. The Falls
Church Telephone Company began operations
in 1888, and electric trolley service reached
East Falls Church in 1897. Residential
development increased, with the first
subdivisions constructed in 1891, followed by
electricity in 1898. Educator Mattie Gundry
formed the Virginia Training School in 1899,
where she taught mentally disadvantaged
students skills to enrich their lives. The same
year, the Falls Church Library Association
created the first public library under the
leadership of Mary Riley Styles.

The Spanish American War

Alger, 1898. MRSPL

The sinking of the USS Maine at Havana, Cuba, ignited the
Spanish American War in 1898, dramatically changing life in
Falls Church. Southwest of town, Camp Alger was built to
train 30,000 troops, including African Americans of the 10th
Cavalry Buffalo soldiers. The East Falls Church train station
became a bustling center full of recruits, camp suppliers and
visitors. Crowded army trains, drum noise, wagon and
carriage traffic and carousing soldiers disrupted local life.
Among the visitors was President William McKinley, who
arrived with an entourage of cabinet officers and foreign
dignitaries to review 15,000 troops. They rode 200 horses
into town, creating a cloud of dust that rendered visibility
nearly impossible. In July of 1898, an outbreak of typhoid
prompted the closing of Camp Alger by September.

Civil Rights and Segregation
By 1900, Falls Church was the largest town in Fairfax County. A
1904 map of the town shows 125 homes, 55 stores and offices,
seven churches and 38 properties that could support farms and
orchards. In many ways, Falls Church was progressive. But in
1912, Virginia passed legislation allowing communities to impose
segregation. In 1915, the town council proposed an ordinance
mandating African Americans live in specific confined areas of
town. Local black citizens E.B. Henderson, Joseph Tinner and
seven other men formed the Colored Citizens Protective League
to object. The group ultimately became the first rural branch of the
NAACP in the nation. They strategized and hired legal counsel to
establish the unconstitutionality of the ordinance. Although they
were successful in preventing its implementation, many public
facilities remained segregated.

The Great War and Postwar Progress
When the nation entered World War I, local officials pushed for the reopening of Camp Alger near
Falls Church, but the War Department selected land south of Alexandria that became Fort Belvoir.
Five of the 314 men from Falls Church who were drafted died in military service. The war ended in
November 1918 coinciding with the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, which infected 500 million
worldwide and killed 531 in Fairfax County. With men at war, women in Falls Church took on new
roles, joining the women’s suffrage movement, and eventually earning the right to vote. In 1921,
Falls Church elected two women to town council: Mrs. P.H. Smyth and Mattie Gundry, who served
three terms and was the first woman to serve on the board of directors of the Falls Church Bank.
Mary Ellen Henderson and Viola Hudson were civil rights activists and women’s rights reformers
whose efforts resulted in achieving equal facilities for black students at the Falls Church Colored
School and public services for the black community.

From Horses to Highway

Plans for Lee Highway, ca. 1922. VDOT
Local roads were winding and narrow, cheap to build and maintain as they followed the contour of
the land for horses and wagons. Automobiles required straighter, paved roads to allow for their
increased speed, safety, visibility and mechanical vulnerability. In 1919, the association for planning
national highways proposed Lee Highway as a coast-to-coast road. The first portion was completed
by 1928 and provided a paved road from southwest Virginia to Washington, D.C. A local
businessman, Merton E. Church, whose company paved the road with concrete from Falls Church
to the Fairfax courthouse, was largely responsible for routing the highway through town. It improved
the regional transportation network and benefitted development, but its construction disrupted
businesses and bisected the property of many residents, including the thriving African American
community.
Growing Pains
Between the two World Wars, and in spite of the Great
Depression, Falls Church prospered. It grew in
population as a suburban community for the nation’s
capital, with many residents working in governmentrelated jobs. In 1924, Virginia established a separate
school district for the town. Two years later, Madison
Elementary School opened, and the Jefferson Institute
became a four-year high school. Both schools were for
white students only. It was not until after World War II
that modern schools were built for black children. In
1930, the town built a municipal water system to serve
the growing community. East Falls Church residents,
dissatisfied with the town’s priorities, and voted to rejoin
Arlington County in 1936. That same year, the airconditioned State Theater opened, making the town a
popular local destination. Increasing car ownership
helped end local trolley service in 1939.

World War II and City Status
During World War II, 25 Falls Church servicemen died or went
missing. In 1945, Virginia abolished the independence of the town’s
schools, placing them under Fairfax County jurisdiction. This decision,
along with concerns about property taxes, municipal water,
transportation and town planning, led to a drive for independent
status. Falls Church became a city in 1948, with the population
topping 5,000 and rising due to the postwar “baby boom.” Civic and
social organizations flourished. In 1949, the City once again operated
its own school district with 927 students. That same year, James Lee
Elementary School for African American students was built in Fairfax
County. Like most of American society, the community and schools
remained largely segregated, excluding blacks from social and cultural
services. African Americans founded their own service groups, such as
the Mother’s Council, Masons and Eastern Star.

1950 And Beyond
A Small Independent City
By the end of the 20th century, the City’s population had tripled. Its housing and neighborhoods
have become a notable mix of preserved pre-1910 houses and newer residential construction with
affordable housing as a continuing challenge. Commercial development and transportation
improvements from the 1950s to the 1980s (Seven Corners, Tyson’s Corner, Capital Beltway,
Metro and Route 66) have emphasized Falls Church’s links to the greater area. These changes
also enhanced the community’s vitality and improved residents’ access to shopping, businesses
and cultural institutions.
Continuing the struggles and successes of the early 20th century, African American residents led
efforts to obtain full civil rights. In 1961 for example, a diverse coalition of City activists successfully
ended segregation in Falls Church schools, becoming only the second Virginia community to do so.
The City’s cultural diversity broadened in the last decades of the 20th century as peoples from Asia,
Central and South America, many seeking refuge from wars and other conflicts, became the latest
neighbors in the area. In 1964, Eden Center, the largest Asian-themed shopping complex on the
East Coast, opened in Falls Church.
The City has been recognized as an All American City by the National Civic League in 1962 and
continues to be named a state leader in Tree City USA recognition annually through the National
Arbor Day Foundation. During unprecedented growth and change, the City continues to maintain its
identity and provide high quality schools, environmentally friendly greenspaces, quality housing and
small-town character.
