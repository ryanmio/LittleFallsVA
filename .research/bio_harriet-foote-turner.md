# Harriet Foote Turner: Falls Church’s 19th-Century Liberator

## A Free Woman in an Enslaved Society 
Harriet Foote Turner was born in 1810 and grew up as a free Black woman in northern Virginia, a rare status in a state where the vast majority of African Americans were enslaved. Free people of color in antebellum Virginia faced harsh restrictions despite their nominal freedom – they were required to carry “free papers” and register with local authorities, barred from learning to read or write, and lived under constant threat of being kidnapped or forced into slavery ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=occupation%2C%20Confederate%20Col,both%20shot%20in%20the%20head)) ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=900&meta_id=71437#:~:text=Guards%2C%20including%20Frank%20Brooks%20%28freedman%29,show%20many%20claims%20for%20war)). In Harriet’s case, freedom still meant navigating a slave society: she found work on the Falls Church plantation of the prominent Fitzhugh family ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=As%20a%20free%20woman%20of,from%20the%20Alexandria%20slave%20market)). One of her assigned duties was both grim and telling – she was sent to the slave market in Alexandria to collect newly purchased enslaved people for the Fitzhugh plantation ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=As%20a%20free%20woman%20of,from%20the%20Alexandria%20slave%20market)). This role placed Harriet, a free woman of color, in the painful position of escorting others in bondage. Yet it also gave her a unique opportunity to observe the slave trade up close and to devise an audacious plan to subvert it. Those who knew her later described Harriet as possessing uncommon courage and resolve, traits she would soon put to the ultimate test.

## Forging Freedom: The 1851 Escape to Canada 
In the spring of 1851, Harriet Turner made a fateful decision that would secure her place in history. She was tasked with picking up a group of 12 enslaved men and women from Alexandria and delivering them to the Fitzhugh plantation in Falls Church ([Commentary: Why Women’s History Month Matters Today - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/13/commentary-why-womens-history-month-matters-today/#:~:text=A%20few%20examples%20from%20our,journey%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). Instead of complying, Harriet boldly **posed as their “owner,” forged travel passes**, and led the entire group north on a perilous journey to freedom in Canada ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=As%20a%20free%20woman%20of,from%20the%20Alexandria%20slave%20market)) ([Commentary: Why Women’s History Month Matters Today - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/13/commentary-why-womens-history-month-matters-today/#:~:text=A%20few%20examples%20from%20our,journey%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). Disguised by the very paperwork meant to keep Black people in bondage, Harriet and the 12 freedom-seekers slipped through slave patrols and checkpoints. It was an extraordinarily dangerous act of resistance – had they been caught, Harriet could have faced severe punishment or re-enslavement for aiding a mass escape. But her ruse worked. Navigating the Underground Railroad routes that wound from Virginia through the free states, she guided the group out of reach of slave catchers. By the time Fitzhugh and the authorities realized something was amiss, Harriet and the fugitives were likely well on their way to Canada, beyond the grasp of the Fugitive Slave Act. Her successful liberation of a dozen people is a local legend paralleling the famous exploits of Harriet Tubman, yet it happened right out of Falls Church. This act of “stealing” human property was a direct challenge to the slave system – a **quiet, clever insurrection** carried out by a free Black woman in an era when such defiance was almost unthinkable. As one account simply puts it, “In 1851, instead of delivering twelve people to the plantation, she led them on a perilous journey to freedom in Canada” ([Commentary: Why Women’s History Month Matters Today - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/13/commentary-why-womens-history-month-matters-today/#:~:text=A%20few%20examples%20from%20our,journey%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). 

Harriet’s brave deed did not come without sacrifice. After spiriting the 12 enslaved individuals to freedom, she could not safely return to Falls Church ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=plantation%2C%20she%20posed%20as%20their,them%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). Helping slaves escape was a grave crime in Virginia; remaining in the area would have almost certainly meant arrest or violent retribution. Facing exile from her lifelong home, Harriet made her way out of the South. Historical hints suggest she may have initially gone to Canada with the group or slipped into a Northern free state. Ultimately, Harriet settled in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts – a community known for its abolitionist sympathies – where she lived out much of her later life ([Galloway Methodist Church | American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/galloway-methodist-church#:~:text=Additional%20Notable%20People%20Interred%20in,the%20Cemetery)). Even in freedom, she likely lived discreetly, aware that slave owners or bounty hunters might seek to retaliate. For a time, Harriet Turner vanished from Falls Church’s daily life, but she refused to sever ties with the people and place she loved. Through letters and word of mouth, she stayed in contact with family back in Virginia ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=plantation%2C%20she%20posed%20as%20their,them%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). The Civil War a decade later would finally eradicate slavery and open the door for Harriet to reconnect more openly with her hometown. 

## Ties to Tinner Hill: Family, Land, and Community  
 ([Galloway Methodist Church | American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/galloway-methodist-church#:~:text=Additional%20Notable%20People%20Interred%20in,the%20Cemetery))After the Civil War, Harriet Turner quietly re-established a presence in the Falls Church area – not for herself, but for her family. Unable to return during the 1850s, she had nonetheless maintained a lifeline to loved ones who remained in Virginia ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=plantation%2C%20she%20posed%20as%20their,them%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). With emancipation, those family members were now free. Harriet, by then in her fifties, helped ensure they had not just freedom but footing. She provided funds to **purchase land in the Tinner Hill area for her relatives**, seeding a nascent Black community in Falls Church ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=plantation%2C%20she%20posed%20as%20their,them%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). Local tradition holds that Harriet’s savings went toward buying a parcel of farmland in the 1860s, at a time when landownership was newly possible for African Americans. Indeed, records show that members of the extended Foote family (Harriet’s kin) and other Black families began acquiring property on the outskirts of town in the post-war years ([Letters to the Editor: October 3 – 9, 2013 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/10/03/letters-to-the-editor-october-3-9-2013/#:~:text=would%20then%20resell%20the%20land,Brice%20and%20Harriet%20Foote%20Turner)). Harriet herself “lived where the Falls Church tobacco barns once stood, on what is now South Maple Avenue,” according to a Virginia historical resolution ([](https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+HJ350ER+pdf#:~:text=WHEREAS%2C%20members%20of%20the%20Henderson,now%20South%20Maple%20Avenue%3B%20and)). That site – near the intersection of South Washington Street and Tinner Hill Road – was part of a growing African American neighborhood. It was here that Charles and Mary Tinner, family friends of Harriet, also bought land and established homes, giving the area its enduring name “Tinner Hill” ([Tinner Hill Considered For Falls Church Cultural And Historic District | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/tinner-hill-considered-falls-church-cultural-historic-district#:~:text=Key%20sites%20in%20the%20district,Tinner%20and%20Mary%20Ellen%20Henderson)) ([Tinner Hill Considered For Falls Church Cultural And Historic District | Falls Church, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/tinner-hill-considered-falls-church-cultural-historic-district#:~:text=figures%20to%20be%20recognized%20in,Tinner%20and%20Mary%20Ellen%20Henderson)). 

The land Harriet secured became a refuge and homestead for her siblings, nieces, and nephews in the tumultuous Reconstruction era. Notably, Harriet Foote Turner was the aunt of **Edwin Bancroft (E.B.) Henderson**, who was born in 1883 to a prominent Falls Church Black family ([](https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?141+ful+HJ350ER+pdf#:~:text=WHEREAS%2C%20members%20of%20the%20Henderson,now%20South%20Maple%20Avenue%3B%20and)). E.B. Henderson would later become a pioneering civil rights leader and co-founder of the first rural branch of the NAACP at Tinner Hill, but his own roots traced back to the very ground Harriet helped anchor for the family. In an 1890s gerrymander by the town, the Tinner Hill enclave (along with other Black neighborhoods) was cut out of the town limits – yet Black landowners like **“Freddie Foote, Harriet Brice and Harriet Foote Turner”** persisted, holding on to their properties on the Fairfax County side ([Letters to the Editor: October 3 – 9, 2013 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2013/10/03/letters-to-the-editor-october-3-9-2013/#:~:text=would%20then%20resell%20the%20land,Brice%20and%20Harriet%20Foote%20Turner)). Oral history suggests Harriet Turner may have returned to Falls Church in her twilight years or at least visited; at the very least, the property she secured kept her connected to the community’s growth. By the late 19th century, the Tinner Hill area was a thriving African American district with homes, a church, and small businesses – a place where formerly enslaved and freeborn Black families built new lives. Harriet’s quiet investment in land helped make that possible. It speaks to her foresight: she not only freed people from slavery, she later helped provide them a place to truly live free. 

## “Forgotten” No More: Remembering Harriet Turner’s Legacy 
For much of the 20th century, Harriet Foote Turner’s heroism went unheralded in the public history of Falls Church. The grand narratives of the Civil War and Reconstruction often overlooked the contributions of local Black women like her. She left no diary or published memoir, and her daring 1851 rescue was carried out in secrecy. As a result, Harriet’s story survived largely in the memories of her family and the Black community. Her name does not appear in older standard histories of Falls Church, and for years only a modest gravestone marked her presence. That weathered stone, located in the historic **Galloway United Methodist Church cemetery**, reads: “Sacred to the memory of Harriet Turner, of Cambridgeport, Mass., and her beloved mother Rachel Hartshorn – Rest in Peace.” ([Galloway Methodist Church | American Battlefield Trust](https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/galloway-methodist-church#:~:text=Additional%20Notable%20People%20Interred%20in,the%20Cemetery)) It lies in a corner of Falls Church that was once part of the very plantation she fled, now a resting place for many African American trailblazers. 

In recent years, however, Harriet Turner’s legacy has been rediscovered and celebrated as an essential part of Falls Church history. Her name now features alongside other local icons in community commemorations. The Falls Church Women’s History Group, for example, honored Harriet as a **“19th-Century Liberator”** during its annual Women’s History Walk, recognizing her bold action in freeing the 12 enslaved individuals ([Falls Church Women's History Walk - Harriet Foote Turner](https://sites.google.com/view/fc-womens-history-walk/home/herstory-stations/harriet-foote-turner#:~:text=As%20a%20free%20woman%20of,from%20the%20Alexandria%20slave%20market)). A citywide commentary noted that **“Harriet Foote Turner was a woman of color”** who defied the odds and led people to freedom, holding her up as an inspiration for later generations ([Commentary: Why Women’s History Month Matters Today - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2025/03/13/commentary-why-womens-history-month-matters-today/#:~:text=A%20few%20examples%20from%20our,journey%20to%20freedom%20in%20Canada)). The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation has also embraced Harriet’s story in the broader narrative of the African American experience in Falls Church. In the historic Galloway church cemetery, interpretive signs now include Harriet’s biography, ensuring visitors learn of “Harriet Foote Turner, [who] escaped from the nearby Cook-Fitzhugh plantation… and led 12 enslaved persons to freedom” ([Galloway United Methodist Church (1867- ) | BlackPast.org](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/galloway-united-methodist-church-1867/#:~:text=cemetery%20holds%20the%20gravesites%20of,Home%20Guard%2C%20an%20interracial%20militia)). And in 2025, the Falls Church City Council discussed naming new parks after the **Foote family**, explicitly to honor figures like Harriet Foote Turner who “assisted enslaved people in their quest for freedom” ([CitizenPortal.ai - Falls Church City Council considers naming parks after Foote family for historical legacy](https://citizenportal.ai/articles/2429756/Falls-Church-City/Virginia/Falls-Church-City-Council-considers-naming-parks-after-Foote-family-for-historical-legacy#:~:text=During%20the%20City%20of%20Falls,in%20their%20quest%20for%20freedom)). Such efforts signal a conscious shift toward a fuller, more inclusive history of the city.

Harriet Turner’s life – her courage in the face of injustice, her sacrifice and exile, and her later dedication to family and community – adds a vital chapter to the story of Falls Church. It reminds us that the fight for freedom and equality was waged not only on battlefields or in courts, but also through the quiet heroism of individuals who refused to accept tyranny. Today, Harriet’s legacy lives on in the thriving African American community that took root at Tinner Hill, in the descendants who still remember “Aunt Harriet,” and in the public history projects that finally speak her name. By reclaiming her story, Falls Church acknowledges that its history was shaped as much by the resilience of a Black woman forging freedom as by any mayor, general, or founding father. Harriet Foote Turner’s long-forgotten tale of resistance now stands as a proud example of courage and defiance – a beacon from the past guiding Falls Church toward a more truthful and inclusive narrative of its own heritage.
