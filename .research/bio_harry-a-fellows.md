# Harry A. Fellows and Segregated Housing in Falls Church

Harry Andrew Fellows (1866–1943) was a prominent Falls Church real estate figure and civic leader in the early 20th century. He served as mayor of Falls Church for eight years (1920–1928) and later became the first chairman of the Arlington County Board in 1932 ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=Harry%20Fellows%20became%20mayor%20of,supervisor%20from%20its%20Washington%20district)). During his tenure, Fellows helped shape local development and governance. **However, his legacy is intertwined with the era’s segregationist housing practices** – including racially restrictive covenants and policies that excluded non-white residents from many neighborhoods. This profile examines Fellows’s role in promoting or enforcing those discriminatory practices, how his developments influenced Falls Church’s racial geography, and how modern narratives have portrayed (or overlooked) this aspect of his legacy.

A native of Alabama, Fellows moved to the Washington area for law school and settled in East Falls Church around 1900 ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=A%20native%20of%20Livingston%2C%20Alabama%2C,heart%20lay%20in%20civic%20activism)). He quickly became active in civic affairs. By the 1910s, he was president of the Falls Church Citizens Association, a leading civic group, and also helped found Arlington County’s Civic Federation ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=After%20buying%20the%20Washington%20Blvd,the%20French%20Lodge%20of%20Washington)). In 1920, Fellows won election as **Mayor of the Town of Falls Church**, a position he held for multiple terms ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=Harry%20Fellows%20became%20mayor%20of,supervisor%20from%20its%20Washington%20district)). His mayoralty coincided with rapid suburban growth and the entrenchment of Jim Crow segregation in Virginia. He championed local “improvements” like new schools and infrastructure for the predominantly white community – for example, overseeing bond sales in 1926 to fund Madison Elementary (a white school) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=Harry%20Fellows%20became%20mayor%20of,supervisor%20from%20its%20Washington%20district)). In 1932, as Falls Church’s jurisdictional lines shifted, Fellows played a key role in separating his East Falls Church neighborhood from the town (annexing it to Arlington County) and was sworn in as **Arlington’s first County Board Chairman** ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=In%201932%2C%20Fellows%20was%20sworn,committee%20that%20renamed%20Arlington%E2%80%99s%20streets)) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=He%20was%20active%20in%20the,the%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church)). Through these roles, Fellows had substantial influence over land use and community planning across Falls Church and Arlington at a time when **segregation in housing was either legally mandated or privately enforced**.

## Segregation Ordinance of 1915 and Racially Restrictive Covenants

Fellows rose to prominence just as Falls Church’s white leadership was trying to enforce residential segregation by law. In June 1915 – five years before Fellows became mayor – the Falls Church Town Council adopted an ordinance to **divide the town into “white” and “colored” districts**, making it illegal for people to sell or rent homes to Blacks in white-designated areas ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2011%2C%201915%2C%20a,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)). This segregation ordinance was enabled by a 1912 Virginia law, and local officials justified it under the pretense of “public health and order” ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20December%2014%2C%201914%2C%20it,went%20into%20effect%20one%20year)). **Black community leaders, led by Joseph Tinner and Dr. E.B. Henderson, organized protests** and even formed one of the first rural chapters of the NAACP to fight the ordinance ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2011%2C%201915%2C%20a,Council%20member%20Harmon%20voting%20nay)) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20January%2020%2C%201915%2C%20Dr,formed%20just%20six%20years%20earlier)). Despite their objections, the council (dominated by white citizens) approved the measure in January 1915. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 1917 *Buchanan v. Warley* decision soon struck down such race-based zoning laws as unconstitutional, but in Falls Church the damage was done – many Black families felt pressure to move, and the invalidated law stayed on the town’s books for decades (it was not formally repealed until 1999) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Asked%20to%20respond%2C%20Edwin%20Henderson,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)) ([[PDF] 2. Background | Falls Church, VA](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/852/Background#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%202.%20Background%20,and%20others%20had%20fought)). 

Although Fellows was not yet on the Council in 1915, he was part of the white civic establishment that broadly supported residential segregation. Indeed, **local white developers and officials quickly pivoted to private mechanisms – notably restrictive covenants in property deeds – to continue excluding non-white people** after the ordinance was nullified ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=racial%20covenants,%E2%80%9D)) ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=the%20city%20of%20Falls%20Church,%E2%80%9D)). During the 1920s, when Fellows was mayor, these racially restrictive covenants became commonplace in Falls Church’s new subdivisions. The covenants were clauses written into deeds that **barred the sale or rental of a property to anyone not “of the Caucasian race,”** ensuring neighborhoods remained exclusively white even without an explicit law ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=racial%20covenants,%E2%80%9D)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,%E2%80%9D)). 

 ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/)) *A 1922 deed for Falls Church’s “Woodland” subdivision included a covenant barring sale or lease of any lot to “any one not of the Caucasian race.” Such clauses were typical in the 1920s ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,%E2%80%9D)).* 

Two real estate developers active in Falls Church during Fellows’s mayoralty – **Harry C. Birge and Ruby Lee Minar** – were especially notorious for inserting such covenants. Birge, a D.C.-based lawyer, planned the **Woodland** tract (near today’s Fulton Avenue) and, as early as November 1922, his deeds specified that no lot could *“be leased, devised, sold or conveyed to any one not of the Caucasian race,”* with any violation causing the title to revert ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,%E2%80%9D)). Ruby Lee Minar, a prominent woman developer, launched the large **Greenway Downs** subdivision in the late 1920s on the south side of Falls Church. Minar’s sales agreements similarly declared *“neither said property nor any part thereof…shall be sold or leased to a negro or a person of negro descent.”* ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Her%20sales%20agreement%E2%80%94posted%20by%20the,%E2%80%9D)) These private agreements, backed by the force of property law, maintained residential segregation just as effectively as the 1915 ordinance would have – but now under the guise of “normal” real estate practice. By the end of the 1920s, **hundreds of properties in and around Falls Church carried racially exclusive deed language**. Researchers have recently documented about 1,200 lots in the City of Falls Church (and thousands more in surrounding Fairfax and Arlington) that were subject to such restrictive covenants in the first half of the 20th century ([Northern Virginia's History of Racially Restrictive Covenants](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/racially-restrictive-housing-neighborhood-covenants-arlington-falls-church-fairfax-virginia/#:~:text=But%20the%20snapshot%20alone%20is,tranches%20in%20the%20coming%20months)).

As mayor, Fellows did not publicly oppose these covenants – in fact, he operated in concert with the forces promoting them. He served as an officer of the Falls Church Citizens’ Association, which in 1915 had **allied with segregationist goals**. (A 1915 letter from E.B. Henderson to Harry Birge reveals that Henderson and fellow Black citizens knew certain influential white residents were *“favoring this legislation”* to zone Blacks out; Henderson pointedly asked if whites like Birge feared that “colored people may buy property near you…and thereby lower the value of your property.” ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=letter%20to%20Birge%20and%20partner,%E2%80%9D))) That question underscored the prevailing attitude among men like Birge – and presumably Fellows – that Black neighbors were a threat to property values. Fellows himself, as a landowner and community leader, **benefited from Falls Church’s identity as an exclusive, white enclave**. There is no record of him objecting to the racial covenants proliferating in the 1920s; on the contrary, his administration approved new subdivision plans that were drawn up with those restrictive clauses in place ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Language%20in%20sales%20agreements%20that,Greenway%20Downs%20and%20Woodland%20neighborhoods)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Birge%20was%20planning%20what%20became,%E2%80%9D)). Segregation, once it could no longer be enforced by ordinance, was effectively enforced by private contract and social consensus.

## City Planning, Zoning, and Segregationist Practices

Beyond deed covenants, Fellows contributed to other **segregationist development practices** common in that era. During the 1920s and 1930s, local governments employed tools like exclusionary zoning and selective provision of services to shape who could live where ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Later%20after%20World%20War%20II%2C,previously%20owned%20by%20African%20Americans)). Falls Church was no exception. Under Fellows’s leadership, the town pursued modern zoning codes that favored single-family homes and explicitly banned apartments or duplexes in certain areas (for example, Greenway Downs’ plan banned duplexes and required generous setbacks) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Her%20sales%20agreement%E2%80%94posted%20by%20the,%E2%80%9D)). Such rules, while race-neutral on paper, **had the effect of pricing out most African Americans and lower-income people**, confining them to the few areas where they already owned land. Historian Edwin Henderson II notes that *“exclusionary zoning, urban renewal, and discriminatory loan policies”* worked alongside covenants to *“restrict and attempt to push out Northern Virginia’s Black population.”* ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) Fellows, as a pro-development mayor, embraced these planning trends that upheld a segregated status quo.

One example of Fellows’s impact on local geography was the **“East Falls Church” secession**. In the early 1930s, Fellows helped orchestrate the transfer of his East Falls Church neighborhood from the Town of Falls Church to Arlington County ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=He%20was%20active%20in%20the,the%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church)). East Falls Church at that time was a predominantly white section on the town’s outskirts. Residents (led by Fellows) were unhappy with Falls Church’s services and taxes and admired Arlington’s improvements in water and sewer systems ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=The%20reasons%20were%20complex,a%20court%20in%20April%201936)). In 1936, the area was officially annexed to Arlington. This move effectively **shrank the Falls Church town limits in a way that left behind a higher proportion of the Black community in the remaining town**. (Decades earlier, in 1887, Falls Church’s boundaries had been deliberately drawn to exclude heavily Black neighborhoods and dilute Black voting power ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=the%20Ku%20Klux%20Klan%2C%20there,the%20background%20of%20this%20issue)) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=jurisdiction%20back%20to%20Fairfax%20County,the%20background%20of%20this%20issue)) – a “gerrymander” of segregation that foreshadowed later moves. The 1936 border change was driven by municipal concerns, but it also neatly separated the well-to-do (white) East Falls Church residents under Fellows from the historically Black enclaves along South Washington and Annandale Roads.) By carving up jurisdictions, Fellows and his peers could align resources to predominantly white areas while marginalizing Black neighborhoods outside their governance. Indeed, well into the mid-20th century, **African-American sections like the Tinner Hill/Southgate enclave in Falls Church lacked basic services** – no paved roads, no sewer or water lines, irregular trash pickup – until Black activists fought for equal investment ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Americans%20in%20Falls%20Church)) ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Eminent%20domain%20and%20zoning%20African,first%20resort%20for%20these%20projects)). The delay in extending modern infrastructure was another method of reinforcing that those areas were “lesser” parts of town.

In Arlington, where Fellows became county board chair, he continued to influence policies that reflected segregationist norms. One striking action was Arlington’s 1932–34 street-renaming project, in which Fellows took part ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=In%201932%2C%20Fellows%20was%20sworn,committee%20that%20renamed%20Arlington%E2%80%99s%20streets)). Many Arlington streets were renamed after Confederate generals and elite families – an assertion of the Lost Cause narrative in the landscape. (A commenter in a local forum caustically noted that *“Harry Fellows oversaw the naming of everything for Lee and other traitors”* ([Death knell tolls for Victorian home in East Falls Church | ARLnow.com](https://www.arlnow.com/2021/11/19/death-knell-tolls-for-victorian-home-in-east-falls-church/#:~:text=ARLnow,bad%20for%20the%20ghosts)) – referencing Robert E. Lee and other Confederate figures.) While naming streets after Confederates was not a housing policy per se, it was part of the **cultural climate of segregation** that venerated the Old South’s racial hierarchy. In housing, Arlington under Fellows embraced federal programs that enabled whites-only developments. During World War II, for instance, Arlington welcomed large FHA-funded projects like Arlington Village and Buckingham – all built with **whites-only covenants** enforced under federal underwriting guidelines ([Northern Virginia's History of Racially Restrictive Covenants](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/racially-restrictive-housing-neighborhood-covenants-arlington-falls-church-fairfax-virginia/#:~:text=Mortgages%20were%20also%20racially%20restricted,%E2%80%9D)) ([Northern Virginia's History of Racially Restrictive Covenants](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/racially-restrictive-housing-neighborhood-covenants-arlington-falls-church-fairfax-virginia/#:~:text=In%201939%2C%20FHA%20approved%20the,according%20to%20the%20mapping%20project)). Fellows died in 1943, before the postwar housing boom, but the groundwork he helped lay – a county governance structure friendly to developers and deferential to Jim Crow norms – ensured that nearly all new suburban housing in the 1940s and 1950s would be off-limits to Black families. **Black Arlingtonians, like those in Falls Church, were left in aging pockets such as Hall’s Hill, often literally fenced off or walled off from adjacent white subdivisions** ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=Image%20Wall%20of%20Separation%3A%20At,Courtesy%20Deeply%20Rooted)). (In the 1930s a cinder block wall was erected to separate the Black Hall’s Hill neighborhood from white neighbors in north Arlington ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=Image%20Wall%20of%20Separation%3A%20At,Courtesy%20Deeply%20Rooted)).) Fellows’s career bridged Falls Church and Arlington, and on both sides of the border the policies of the day – which he supported – ensured residential segregation was deeply ingrained.

## Public Stance, Statements and Affiliations

Harry Fellows was not known for fiery speeches or published opinions on race, but his **actions and affiliations spoke loudly about his stance on segregation**. All evidence indicates he aligned with the segregationist consensus of white Virginia in that era. He was a member of **social and civic organizations that were implicitly or explicitly segregated**. For example, Fellows belonged to the **Falls Church Episcopal Church (“The Falls Church”)**, an historically white congregation ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=became%20president%20of%20the%20Falls,the%20French%20Lodge%20of%20Washington)), and to fraternal groups like the Odd Fellows and a Masonic lodge (the “French Lodge of Washington”) ([Our Man in Arlington - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/05/28/our-man-in-arlington-425/#:~:text=became%20president%20of%20the%20Falls,the%20French%20Lodge%20of%20Washington)). These groups did not admit African Americans; Blacks had to form their own parallel churches and fraternal orders (indeed, Falls Church’s Black community had its own Prince Hall Masonic lodge and Odd Fellows Lodge as community pillars ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Although%20strictly%20segregated%2C%20the%20African,Colored%20School%20bought%20their%20candy))). Fellows’s leadership of the Citizens Association is also telling – that body’s membership was drawn from the town’s property owners and business elite, who in 1915 almost unanimously favored the residential segregation ordinance. The **Tinner Hill activists recalled that protesting segregation was unpopular enough to endanger their livelihoods**; they “put their lives and families’ livelihoods on the line” by opposing, as they phrased it, *“the actions of the majority of citizens in Falls Church on a matter that was as close as religion in their hearts.”* ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=The%20Ku%20Klux%20Klan%20was,their%20lives%20and%20their%20families)) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=with%20his%20family%20on%20Tinner,families%27%20livelihoods%20on%20the%20line)) The “majority of citizens” referenced were people like Fellows – respectable white homeowners who treated the separation of the races as a core value. There is no indication that Fellows ever broke from that majority view.

Fellows also moved in the same circles as prominent segregationist developers. He corresponded and partnered with figures such as Birge and Samuel Styles (Styles co-sponsored the 1915 segregation ordinance and partnered with Birge in real estate deals) ([Civil Rights History & Tinner Hill — History, Hope and Healing Preserving and Presenting the African American legacy and Promoting Racial Reconciliation in N](https://www.tinnerhill.org/educational-resources/2018/2/15/civil-rights-history-tinner-hill#:~:text=On%20November%209%2C%201914%2C%20Mayor,Nourse%2C%20and%20Harmon%2C%20voted%20against)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)). In 1915, when Henderson wrote to Birge to ask why he was advocating segregation, Birge was working with Styles and likely had support from other town notables. Fellows’s name does not appear on surviving correspondence from Black activists – perhaps because he held no official office in 1915 – but as a rising civic leader he certainly was aware of these debates. His later silence on restrictive covenants in the 1920s suggests tacit approval. Meanwhile, **advertising and rhetoric around Falls Church development in Fellows’s day was clearly aimed at white buyers**. For instance, ads for new subdivisions highlighted strict building codes and “desirable” communities – often code words for racially exclusive. An advertisement for Lyon Park (Arlington) in 1923 boasted of modern amenities and *“for white people only”* policies ([Housing Segregation: Nowhere to Live – Deeply Rooted](https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/you-cant-own-property-and-you-cant-live-here/?ref=fallschurchindependent.com#:~:text=Image)). Realty companies and the local press openly touted neighborhoods “free from undesirable elements.” Fellows never contradicted these messages. As Mayor, he presided over official brochures that promoted Falls Church as an ideal suburb – undoubtedly implying a homogeneous, affluent (and white) citizenry as part of its appeal.

In summary, while Harry Fellows might not have left behind inflammatory quotes about race, **his public life was tightly interwoven with segregationist practice**. He operated within a network of white leaders who deliberately engineered where people of color could and couldn’t live. Whether through the **segregation ordinance** of 1915 or the **“Caucasian only” covenants** of the 1920s, Fellows and his contemporaries shaped Falls Church into a geographically segregated community. The African-American residents who had once comprised nearly half the village’s population after the Civil War ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Before%20the%20Emancipation%20Proclamation%2C%20the,of%20the%20inhabitants))saw their numbers and neighborhoods steadily decline under these pressures. By the 1940 census, on the eve of Fellows’s death, Falls Church’s Black population had dwindled to a small fraction, concentrated in a couple of segregated enclaves, while the town’s new garden subdivisions were entirely white. This outcome was no accident – it was the result of **conscious social engineering**, in which Fellows played a significant, if now often overlooked, part.

## Legacy and How History Remembers Fellows

For many decades, local history narratives **obscured or sanitized Fellows’s role in housing segregation**. He was frequently celebrated simply as a founding father of Falls Church and Arlington. For example, a 1964 Falls Church history by Melvin Steadman Jr. dutifully listed **Harry A. Fellows** among important early citizens, noting his mayoral tenure and civic posts, and describing him as *“a staple of his community.”* ([Fellows Land a Strong Chance for Sustainable Community Outreach - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/09/03/fellows-land-a-strong-chance-for-sustainable-community-outreach/#:~:text=Among%20the%20names%20listed%20in,a%20staple%20of%20his%20community)) Nowhere did that mid-century account mention restrictive covenants or Black displacement. Even into the 21st century, public commemorations focused on Fellows’s public service. The Victorian home where he lived (the Fellows-McGrath House) was regarded as an East Falls Church landmark, and when it was demolished in 2021, news articles highlighted Fellows’s significance as a mayor and Arlington official ([Landmark Victorian-Style House Torn Down To Build New Homes | Arlington, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/arlington-va/landmark-victorian-style-house-torn-down-build-new-homes#:~:text=The%20Fellows,Courtesy%20of%20Arlington%20Historical%20Society)) ([Landmark Victorian-Style House Torn Down To Build New Homes | Arlington, VA Patch](https://patch.com/virginia/arlington-va/landmark-victorian-style-house-torn-down-build-new-homes#:~:text=ARLINGTON%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20A%20large,new%20homes%20on%20the%20site)) – again without discussion of his segregationist activities. The City of Falls Church named a newly acquired park property “Fellows Property” in recent years (on South Oak Street) in reference to the Fellows family that long owned it ([Fellows Property | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/2131/Fellows-Property#:~:text=About%20the%20Project)) ([Fellows Property | Falls Church, VA - Official Website](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/2131/Fellows-Property#:~:text=Current%20Design%20Plans%20can%20be,was%20created%20in%20January%202024)). The city’s description of that project makes no mention of Harry Fellows’s record, apart from the name itself. In short, **Fellows has been memorialized as a civic leader, with the less palatable aspects of his legacy left unspoken**.

Only in the last few years has the community begun to grapple openly with the racist housing policies of Fellows’s era. In 2023, local historian Charlie Clark described the **omission** of segregation history in Falls Church as “eye-opening,” noting that until recently there had been little acknowledgment of the *“racially exclusionary real estate covenants common in new subdivisions a century ago.”* ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=The%20Little%20City%20recorded%20a,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)) Projects like the **Documenting Exclusion & Resilience** map (a collaboration of Marymount and Mary Washington University researchers) have publicly identified properties with restrictive covenants and brought this data to light ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=A%20fresh%20set%20of%20interactive,were%20such%20exclusionary%20practices%20outlawed)) ([Racially Discriminatory Covenants Historically Prevalent Across City of Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchindependent.com/racially-discriminatory-covenants-historically-prevalent-across-city-of-falls-church/#:~:text=Image)). The Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation – led by descendants of the very activists who battled the 1915 ordinance – has worked to ensure the city does not forget this history. Edwin B. Henderson II (grandson of E.B. Henderson) has pressed the City of Falls Church to formally recognize sites like Tinner Hill as historic districts and to **acknowledge the 1915 segregation ordinance in the city’s narrative** ([Tinner Hill Considered For Falls Church Cultural And Historic District](https://patch.com/virginia/fallschurch/tinner-hill-considered-falls-church-cultural-historic-district#:~:text=Tinner%20Hill%20Considered%20For%20Falls,disavowed%20the%201915%20segregation%20ordinance)). In 1999, the Falls Church City Council finally passed a resolution denouncing and repudiating the hateful 1915 law ([[PDF] 2. Background | Falls Church, VA](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/852/Background#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%202.%20Background%20,and%20others%20had%20fought)). These steps indicate a gradual willingness to confront the past. Still, the focus has been more on honoring Black resilience than on naming the individuals responsible for their adversity.

Harry Fellows’s name thus occupies an ambiguous place in Falls Church’s public memory. On one hand, he is enshrined as a pillar of the “Little City” – a mayor who helped establish modern Falls Church and a figure who bridged its transition from town to independent city (Falls Church became an independent city in 1948, a few years after his death). On the other hand, the segregated housing patterns that Fellows abetted have left lasting scars. The socio-economic landscape of Falls Church – a small, affluent, and majority-white community – **was largely set in the era of Fellows’s leadership, when people of color were systematically excluded from home ownership and the attendant wealth-building in the city** ([Northern Virginia's History of Racially Restrictive Covenants](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/racially-restrictive-housing-neighborhood-covenants-arlington-falls-church-fairfax-virginia/#:~:text=became%20illegal%29,%E2%80%9D)) ([Northern Virginia's History of Racially Restrictive Covenants](https://www.arlingtonmagazine.com/racially-restrictive-housing-neighborhood-covenants-arlington-falls-church-fairfax-virginia/#:~:text=all)). Those inequities persist in some form today. Modern Falls Church takes pride in being a welcoming, inclusive community, but as Henderson II writes, *“it wasn’t always that way.”* ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Those%20of%20us%20who%20live,the%20City%E2%80%99s%20history%20is%20a)) The Black families who once made up nearly half of Falls Church’s population were relegated to a marginal status by the likes of Fellows, and many of their descendants were forced to seek housing elsewhere due to the very covenants and policies he supported ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Red%20lining%2C%20a%20practice%20established,in%20wealth%20accumulation%20in%20America)).

In recent years, historians and community members have begun to **re-evaluate Fellows’s legacy with a more critical lens**. They point out that the same person who championed civic improvement also helped erect a system that kept Falls Church and nearby suburbs nearly all-white for generations. This fuller portrait does not erase his contributions – such as helping establish local government institutions – but it provides crucial context. Understanding Fellows’s role in segregationist housing practices serves as a reminder that suburban segregation was not merely an “inevitable” outcome of the times, but the result of deliberate choices by leaders like him ([Housing Segregation: Nowhere to Live – Deeply Rooted](https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/you-cant-own-property-and-you-cant-live-here/?ref=fallschurchindependent.com#:~:text=In%201912%2C%20Virginia%20authorized%20%E2%80%9Csegregation,Caucasian%E2%80%9D%20buyers)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Asked%20to%20respond%2C%20Edwin%20Henderson,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)). By naming and examining those choices, the Little Falls (Little City) community can better acknowledge the harm done and celebrate the courage of those who resisted. 

**Harry A. Fellows helped shape the physical and social landscape of Falls Church**, from plotting its subdivisions to influencing its boundaries. Unfortunately, that legacy includes helping to **draw the color lines** that separated neighbor from neighbor. Today, as Falls Church works to be more inclusive, it must grapple with the fact that one of its esteemed founders was also an architect of housing segregation. Telling the complete story of Harry Fellows – warts and all – is a step toward an honest public history.
