# Turberville: A Planned Town Near Little Falls in 1798

## Transcription of Relevant Portion

"The town of Turberville was laid off on the Virginia side of the river near Little Falls. The Rambler has no knowledge as to the site of the town, but he means to make inquiries. The Virginia legislature on December 31, 1798, enacted that 'Twenty acres of land, the property of John Turberville, lying near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax, so soon as they shall be laid off into lots and convenient streets, shall be established as a town by the name of Turberville.' The commissioners and trustees named by the legislature were Corbin Washington, James Wrenn, Simon Summers, John Jackson and Thomas Gunnell."

## Historical Context

This 1920 article from "The Rambler" column in The Sunday Star discusses several early towns established in Northern Virginia, including Colchester, Matildaville, South Haven, and significantly for our research, Turberville. The article provides critical documentation about the planned town of Turberville, authorized by the Virginia legislature in 1798 to be established on twenty acres of John Turberville's land "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax."

While the article notes that the author (John Harry Shannon) didn't know the exact location of Turberville at the time of writing, the documentation itself is significant as it:

1. Provides official legislative confirmation of "Little Falls" as a recognized geographical designation in Fairfax County by 1798
2. Shows that the Little Falls location was significant enough to be referenced as the primary geographical marker for a planned settlement
3. Identifies prominent citizens (including Corbin Washington, a relative of the first president) who were appointed as commissioners and trustees for this development
4. Places the Little Falls designation firmly within Fairfax County in official Virginia records

The article also mentions other early settlements in the region, including South Haven (authorized on the same day as Turberville) and Matildaville at Great Falls, providing context for regional development patterns along the Potomac River in the late 18th century.

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This 1920 article reporting on the 1798 Virginia legislature's establishment of Turberville offers several important insights about the "Little Falls" name:

1. **Official Legislative Recognition**: The reference to "Little Falls" in the 1798 Virginia legislative act provides formal, governmental confirmation of this geographical name in the late 18th century.

2. **Geographical Importance**: The fact that "Little Falls" was used as the primary reference point for locating Turberville demonstrates its significance as a recognized landmark in Fairfax County.

3. **Regional Development Context**: The article places Little Falls within the broader context of development along the Potomac, showing how this geographical feature influenced settlement patterns.

4. **Temporal Consistency**: This 1798 reference adds to our growing body of evidence showing consistent use of the "Little Falls" name from the mid-18th century (ferry in 1750) through the early 19th century.

5. **Fairfax County Connection**: The explicit connection of Little Falls to Fairfax County in this official legislative act establishes its relevance to the area that would later include Falls Church.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This document provides additional compelling evidence supporting the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Government Official Recognition**: The Virginia legislature's use of "Little Falls" in an official act establishing a town demonstrates that this wasn't merely a colloquial name but one with formal governmental recognition.

2. **Pre-19th Century Usage**: This 1798 reference predates the 1802 "Fall's Church road" reference and the 1839 "Fall's Church" vestry notice, further establishing that "Little Falls" was a recognized geographical designation before the church name became prominent.

3. **Fairfax County Planning Context**: The fact that the Virginia legislature approved a town site "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax" shows that this geographical feature was considered significant for regional planning and development.

4. **Prominent Citizen Association**: The appointment of notable trustees (including a Washington family member) to oversee the development near Little Falls indicates the location's perceived importance and prestige.

5. **Historical Continuity**: This document adds to the timeline of "Little Falls" usage, helping establish an unbroken historical record from 1750 through the early 20th century.

This Virginia legislative act from December 31, 1798, establishing Turberville "near the Little Falls, in the county of Fairfax" provides another authoritative historical source confirming that "Little Falls" was the original, government-recognized geographical designation for this region. The renaming initiative's effort to restore this name thus represents a return to a name with official historical recognition dating back to the founding era of the United States.
