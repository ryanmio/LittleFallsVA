# May Face VEA Action
# Arlington Teacher Group Integrates

ARLINGTON – Virginia Education Association directors are expected to grapple next month with the question of whether to expel its Arlington affiliate – the first local teachers association in the state to approve admission of Negroes to its membership.

Sources hesitate to predict the eventual outcome of this controversy, but are hoping the VEA board of directors will decline to recommend expulsion, an action never before taken against a local affiliate.

VOTES tallied yesterday showed that, despite veiled threats of expulsion by the VEA, Arlington's white teachers had approved by a 56-vote margin the proposed merger of the white and Negro teachers associations in the county.

With 90 per cent of the 1,100-member Arlington Education Association voting, 519 ballots were cast in favor of admitting Negro teachers and 463 ballots were cast against the action.

The 84-member Negro Arlington Teachers Association voted earlier to support the principle of a desegregated teachers unit.

AEA EXECUTIVE Secretary Richard Neal said the close vote resulted more from a fear of VEA expulsion than it did from a reluctance to admit Negro teachers.

"I just can't believe there are 463 teachers who believe that Negro teachers shouldn't be a part of the Arlington Education Association," he said.

Neal said AEA President Sim Taylor will write the VEA informing it officially of the Arlington action. "What will happen at that point no one can say," he added.

The executive secretary of the VEA, Robert F. Williams, said he has "no idea what the board will do because this has never happened before."

He noted, however, that the VEA's statewide drama section was expelled some time ago for admitting Negro members.

While there is no provision in the VEA constitution or bylaws against admitting Negro teachers, Williams said, it had been felt there was no need for such a provision.

DURING the balloting, some argued that there had been indications from Richmond that any desegregated local group would be expelled. Others, pointing to the state's "freedom of choice" program and the VEA's announced policy of conforming to general state practices on integration, argued that the VEA would allow Arlington to pursue its own desired course.

One VEA official speculated that, if the board of directors declined to recommend expulsion, the VEA general assembly next fall would allow Arlington to remain in the group. In any event, he added, the issue is almost certain to arise at the October assembly session.
