# Group Has 5-1 Edge As Result
# Dennis Named to Falls Church Council

FALLS CHURCH – Samuel C. Dennis, a former councilman who is a candidate for the Citizens for a Better City for council in the June city election, last night was named to the unexpired council term of Charles Kellogg who resigned.

The term ends Aug. 31. Dennis, who received the highest number of votes as a write-in candidate at the CBC nominating convention in March, was appointed to the council post last night on a second ballot with five of six council votes.

COUNCILMAN Charles Seymour supported Archie Monson for the post. In the initial balloting, Dennis got three votes, with Councilman Everett Johnston supporting Claud Wells, and Councilman Harold Silverstein voting for Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones. Johnston and Silverstein switched their votes to Dennis.

Others recommended for the vacancy were Planning Commission member E. John Rockey and Falls Church Taxpayer League president Francis Trapp, both independent candidates for the council.

The appointment of Dennis gives the CBC six members on the council.

Seymour, who announced he is not planning to run for re-election because of the pressure of business, lambasted the appointment of Dennis. In an obvious reference to the CBC, Seymour said "Falls Church is entering into a controlled political machine – an Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy type of politics. It was cut and dried as to who was going to be appointed," he said.

SILVERSTEIN called Seymour's comments "unfounded and confused." Dennis later was sworn in as councilman and took part in the meeting.

A statistician with the Bureau of the Census, Dennis was a member of the council from 1948 to 1953.
