# 'Resistance' Still in Saddle?

To The Editor:

One wonders how the recent claims of the Harrison-Godwin ticket to love, honor, and protect the public school system of Virginia jibe with the most recent appointment of Ruth Bauserman to manage their new Arlington headquarters. Harrison's running mate Godwin in Richmond and "our" Mrs. Bauserman in Arlington fought "long and loud" for a policy which would, in effect, have closed our schools. Can it be that the old "massive resistance" mentality still sits firmly in the saddle, if one bets on the Harrison horse?

On Dec. 4, 1958, during those dark days of doubt and fear when schools in Charlottesville and Norfolk had already succumbed to hysteria and had closed their doors, Mary Marshall submitted a resolution to the Arlington Democratic Committee urging that "all honorable and legal means" for keeping the schools open be pursued in Arlington.

The realistic, thoughtful majority of that committee gave the resolution its overwhelming support. Only six members, in fact, expressed themselves against it, including the woman who has now been selected to mother-hen the local offices of the Harrison-Godwin-Button ticket.

One can conclude only that Harrison finds rather slim pickings among his supporters in Arlington or that Mrs. Bauserman and massive resistance represent the true but antiquated sentiments of the Harrison-Godwin-Button ticket, all recent pronouncements to the contrary.

## Research Notes

This letter provides valuable insights into the broader state-level political context surrounding school integration in Northern Virginia:

1. **Massive Resistance legacy**: The letter demonstrates how "massive resistance" remained a divisive political issue in Virginia in 1961, with the writer questioning if the Harrison-Godwin gubernatorial ticket still secretly harbored pro-segregation views despite their public statements. This reveals the lingering tensions even as official policies were beginning to change.

2. **Arlington's progressive stance**: The letter specifically mentions that Arlington had taken steps to avoid school closures, contrasting with Charlottesville and Norfolk which had "succumbed to hysteria" - highlighting Arlington's more progressive approach. This aligns with other evidence showing Arlington leading integration efforts in Northern Virginia.

3. **Regional variation**: The letter implicitly compares Arlington's approach with other parts of Virginia, showing the political differences between Northern Virginia and other regions regarding integration. This reinforces the pattern of Northern Virginia jurisdictions moving more quickly toward integration than other parts of the state.

4. **1958 crisis point**: References the "dark days of doubt and fear" in December 1958 establish a timeline of when Virginia's massive resistance policies reached their peak, leading to actual school closures in some jurisdictions. This provides crucial context for understanding the evolution of integration policies.

5. **Political evolution**: The writer suggests that the Harrison campaign was trying to present a more moderate image on school integration while still employing people who had previously supported closing schools rather than integrating. This highlights the political transition occurring in Virginia as open resistance became less tenable.

This letter, when read alongside other election-related content from June 1961, reveals how school integration remained a central political issue in Virginia during the gubernatorial campaign, which was occurring simultaneously with Falls Church's local election and the beginning of school integration efforts in that city.

The document shows that even as Falls Church was moving forward with integration under CBC leadership, the statewide political landscape remained divided, with the Harrison-Godwin ticket (who would eventually win) attempting to navigate the political transition away from "massive resistance" while still appealing to its former supporters.
