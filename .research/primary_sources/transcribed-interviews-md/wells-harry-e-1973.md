## Transcript

This is January 20, 1973 in Falls Church, Virginia in the home of Harry E. Wells, City Manager. Mr. Wells is going to tell us something about his family and his early life in Falls Church as well as his recollections of the old Harmon Blacksmith shop on East Fairfax Street near the Falls Church. 

The Wells family moved to Falls Church in 1972 and we lived at 216 East Fairfax Street in a relatively old home. My parents both came from Catawba Mountain which is between Blacksburg, Salem and Rome and moved to Catawba Mountain and Catawba Valley. 

They moved to Washington, D.C. area and eventually lived in Sea Pleasant, Maryland where I was born and moved to Falls Church then in 1922. I have three brothers and one sister, Claude Wells who lives on Midvale Street now, Glenn Wells who lives in, by the way, Mary Frances Lester, one of the older families of Falls Church, lives in West Virginia now. 

Stanley Wells lives on Highway Road and my sister Shirley lives on Highway Road. We lived on... You said you mostly lived on Highway Road? Highway Road in Fairfax County. What was your father's full name? 

My father's full name was Sherman M. Wells. Your mother made Ruthie? Ruthie Wells. She was a garment and her family was the name that I remember talking about. Garments, real hearts, shepherds, practically, and Wells who lived in Catawba. 

Valley and practically everybody down there at one time was related to us and we would visit at my grandparent's home. Almost everybody in Catawba Valley were related to the rest of the family. What was your father's business or why did he come to Falls Church? 

I think he came to Falls Church just to get away from the mountains and originally but he when he first came to Washington DC he worked for the he was conductor on the trolley line in Washington DC. Within the city? 

Within the city of Washington DC. Then he became connected with Woodlawn Lothropson actually as a carpenter and he was in charge of the carpenter shop in Woodlawn Lothropson, Washington DC. Did he continue to work for Woodlawn Lothropson after he came to Falls Church? 

Yeah he worked for Woodlawn Lothropson until he returned. Oh and when did he retire? Yes a hard question. I don't recall exactly when he retired. I would say 1962. How about the house where you lived on Fairfax Street? 

Well the house we moved into as I mentioned earlier was old and it was an old framed house. An old framed house that was similar to the one that Mises now live in and have remodeled. We lived in that old house for about six years and my father built what eventually was a chicken house. 

We moved in and lived one summer when he really remodeled the house into the frame. house that was there and torn down for the Merrill house. What was the house number? 216 East Fairfax Street was the house number. 

And what year was what year was it torn down? I would think in 1927. Torn down? That's the old house. The old house was torn down in 1927. Oh gee, the own house was torn down when the Merrill house was filmed and she had a very good date. 

But that would have been in, I would say 1964. Tell me again a little bit about what you're telling me about your father's construction of the house. Building the new house more or less right over the old one? 

Well, we moved out of the old house and he rebuilt the new house over top of the basement, the existing basement and just extended the basement out to the full basement under the new house. He used the foundation wall which was stoned for a portion of the basement, and that stoned the wall all over it, so it leaked every winter. 

It was still part of the foundation of the new part. What kind of foundation did you put on the new part? The new part was actually center block and cement. Did the old basement have a floor in it, or just a dirt floor? 

No, that was just a dirt floor. I would suspect that it was used for a root cellar more than anything else. When we moved there, it was quite a little truck farm. It had some 24 apple trees and 5 sour cherry trees. 

Blackberries, raspberries, a good garden spot, care trees, strawberries. Who had operated this or who had lived in this? I don't know who had lived there. Just prior to us buying the place, when we bought it, it was in a very run-down condition. 

But we found out that later in years that Mr. Harmon, the blacksmith, had actually planted the orchards there. I had talked to Mr. Harmon after he had retired several times, several years, and he remembered planting the trees on that particular little farm. 

It was about three acres in there. So it was enough, and actually, we lived. We were able to, under the impression, we were able to live very well, right off of the farm. You don't know who built the house or when? 

No, I have no idea. No idea. The later, after the new house was built, we built a tennis court within the east of our house, almost a lot that was owned by any church. And in trying to get the surface smooth, we ran into an old blacksmith, the remains of an old blacksmith shop. 

So we had all kinds of metal. Where was this? It would be, it would be, it would be facing Fairfax Street, but just, it would be east of our house, adjacent to the Anderson home. And there was a remains of an old blacksmith's charm there. 

Anderson? Yeah. What do you mean? That's the house, the Merrill House is the best reference I can tell you to be there. The Merrill House, then there's a little cape card that's now built on what... we used for tennis court for years right on the corner right on the corner right on the corner of uh this would be the east uh going toward broad street right on the corner of broad and fairfax street there's a barge house was owned by amherst and then it built the brook house the brook is right well that's the small houses the small houses between the brook house and the brook house is uh on the corner and then you come to a small cape cut was built by guard church on a lock and that's where it was uh where we built a tennis court and that's where we found when we started excavating for the tennis court we found the um remains of an old blacksmith shop we had to dig out all the old metal the wires Four shoes, 

we ran into all types of metals that we had to dig out and just throw away. Anderson, who eventually sold the house to the brook, was building an additional his house. I want to introduce you to Archibald, his Archibald Anderson's assistant. 

There's some of his family still living here. you just where they are now, but they're still living there, both Mr. and Ms. Anderson did. But Mr. Anderson's building an addition on his house, and we actually helped him excavate underneath there, and use the dirt from his basement to build the tennis court. 

But we found a bottle that's had on it an Emmy Church druggist right on the bottle. Of course, the Emmy Church was really an entrepreneur when he moved to Falls Church, came into Falls Church years ago. 

He came in the early 70s, I think. Yeah, I don't know exactly, but he, we gave the bottle to, I guess, he had it to Guy Church or North of Church, or he had another son called Elkins. So the bottle was just a small bottle that had an Emmy Church druggist, and we thought it would be important to him, so we gave it to him. 

Did you ever learn anything about the identity of the blacksmith shop? No, never did. The only person that might have been able to give us some indication of it was Bob Harmon, but in those days he was operating a blacksmith shop that would be south of, sort of west of us. 

And it was across the street. Yeah, across the street and down and down. So we never did talk to him about it, and it was just, by accident, years later, I think. Didn't you ever even ask him about it? 

No, never did. This is the first animation I've ever heard of a blacksmith shop there. Yeah, yeah. There's supposed to be two blacksmith shops up at Cherry Street and Broad, where Jason too were close to Charlie Kellogg's house. 

Yeah, yeah. I never heard of, I never heard of that. And this couldn't have been a dump, because you could see these cinders that would be coming, you know, from the coals and things of that nature. It was a heck of a mess. 

When we started, when we first moved to Falls Church, all the front of our land, was you could hardly see the house for undergrowth and we gradually year by year cleaned it out, left the trees in place, came down so we had a tremendous yard. 

The front yard was I would say it was at least 100 yards long. It was a long yard 300 feet at least and that came back to behind the house so we had a tremendous front yard to go. Well now this tennis court in the Blackstone Shop area was part of your property. 

No it wasn't part of our property that was part of it. That lot had been cut out by any church that belonged to him. He gave us permission to clean it up with later when the house was built the little Cape Cod house was going to be built. 

We built another tennis court in the west of the house closer to Harlan's Blackstone Shop. You mean prior to down? Prior to down right and that we played on for a number of years but then all of us went in the service in 1941 and there was no one left to play on it and my father just took the backstop down and just made it part of his front yard. 

When was that little house there in the corner? Since you came to culture? Oh yeah that's a very neat house. Colbert Hunter built that house there. I would I would think that house was built after World War II. 

Is he colored man? He's colored, he's black. Do you still live there? Yes he does. I think Mrs. Hunter is still alive too. Her name is now Brown, and she lives in a house that sits pretty far back off the road there. 

And Colbert is one of her sons. And he lives there. How do you spell it? Colbert? C-O-L-B-E-R-T. C-O-L-B-E-R-T, Hunter H-O-N-T. Well, when did you first start working for our city? In 1948. 1948? As city clerk? 

As city clerk in 1940. You had an anti-connection with the city administration before that? No, none at all. Were you serving as city clerk in 1948 until? About nine years ago when I went to city manager. 

So it would be 49 from 1972 to 1963, I guess. And how long did you live here in 706? I moved here I think in 1950. That's 706 property. You have six children? Six children. Three boys and three girls? 

Three boys and three girls. All the children went through St. James school at Dennis J. O'Connell, except the younger boy who's brain damaged and has never gone to school. Michael now has graduated from George Washington University, and he's working for the Guaranty Life Insurance Company in New York City, and lives at Rockaway Beach in New York City. 

Pat is a graduate from St. Bonaventure University. He was a lieutenant in the artillery, the airborne artillery at the Vietnam service time, came back. And now he is teaching in the Fairfax County school system and lives in Fairfax County near the Charterhouse Hotel. 

He's recently bought and will be moving into a townhouse that will be occupied, that is supposedly in March. Nan, the oldest girl, is a graduate from Marygrove College, Marygrove College of Detroit, Michigan. 

She is, well, Mike is married, Pat's is married, and Nan is married. Nan taught in the Arlington County School System in special education for two years. She has a son now, so she is home taking care of him. 

Marguerite was the next oldest, and she is a senior in Bellarmine College in Louisville, Kentucky, and should graduate this May. How do you spell that? B-E-L-L-E-R-M-I-N-E, Bellarmine College. It was Bellarmine and Erselon College, and both were private Catholic schools. 

Bellarmine was the boys' school, Erselon was the girls' school, and then they combined when she was a sophomore here at Bellarmine College. In her co-educational school. Ruth is going to Marywood College in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

She's a sophomore this year, so she has two more years to go. And, of course, Harry is the youngest boy. He's a brain damage, and we've had him in special schools. But at the present time, he is a... 

I went to grade school here in Falls Church. The first three years, I went to the building that's now the Washington House. Then I went down to Madison School through the 7th grade. From the 7th grade, I went to Grand Junior High School, which was the first grade. 

I was in 22nd G Street in Washington DC for one year. I went over to graduate from Western High School, which is at 35th and R Street. You just missed going to Jefferson High School. Yeah, just missed going. 

In those days, we graduated from Madison. They had two classes. They graduated in February and in June. In those days, if your parents worked in Washington DC, there was no tuition to go to Washington DC schools. 

An awful lot of the students just went to Washington DC to schools. For instance, my brother Claude went to Western High School and graduated. Stanley went to Tech High School and graduated. Glenn went to Old Business, which is in Central High School to graduate from Washington DC. 

Shirley was the only one of our family that graduated from Old Jefferson High School, which was located over on Cherry Street. Then I went into service in 1941. When I got out, I went down to VPI. From VPI, I came to Falls Church. 

I went to work with the city, a city department. I eventually applied for, and I think was lucky enough, to be appointed city manager. I've been very pleased with what people have accomplished for the nine years that I've been married. 

Who did you marry? Kathleen King Kenneth. She lived at 515 West Creek Falls Creek. I didn't meet her until after I had graduated from high school. Her mother died when she was young and she went to school in Philadelphia. 

She was gone nine months out of the year. She went to school outside of Philadelphia. Her family lived in vultures a long time ago. I would guess that her family probably... Lived in Washington, probably longer than we have, but I'm not sure of that. 

They lived in Washington, D.C. for a short while, but moved to, they've been on Broad Street, the house is now torn down, and they moved over to 515. Her father is still living? Her father is still living, yes. 

Good health. Good health. 73. Well, you undoubtedly recollect considerable of what went on on East Fairfax Street when Mr. Harmon was operating a classroom shop there. When you're just, uh, I'm just about, uh... 

Yes, we used to, even before we went to school, we used to visit Mr. Harmon's blacksmith shop as often as we could. It was less than a block away from our house. We used to enjoy going there, especially on red in the snowy days, because all the farmers in the surrounding area would bring their horses in to be shot. 

Because they couldn't work on the farm. They couldn't work on the farm. They were in there to have their horses shot. And, of course, in those days, there were really more horses around than there were automobiles. 

At very seldom, we saw a car going from the center of town toward Alexandria. In fact, the East Fairfax Street was just a dirt road, and in the wintertime, it was almost impossible except for horses and puppies and carriages. 

It was just a dirt road, very dusty if an automobile went down. Very dusty when it was dry and very muddy when it was wet. In the wintertime, you could really only horse-drawn vehicles and wheel-drawn vehicles go up and down. 

But it was fun to go down, not only to listen to the farmers talk about their problems, but to watch Mr. Harmon and his assistant, Henry Simms, show a horse. Henry Simms was a black man, and they were very patient with the kids around. 

Not only would my brothers go with me, but there would be other kids from the village. Very often, the boys from the farm would come in with their parents. After we got into school and got to know those boys, it was on a man day. 

We just got together on Saturday at the next workshop. But he would give us old horseshoes that we could play with. He'd also, every now and then, make us a horseshoe-nailed ring. He was a very kind man. 

It was really an experience to see him fill a shoe to a horse. It was always surprising to me that it didn't hurt the horse. But it didn't. He knew what he was doing. He was the only one. That was the only blacksmith shop in this area that I can recall. 

There were none of these folks. At that time, there wasn't one of these folks. This is the only one that I know of. At the time, it was a two-story frame building. It was lots of... direct equipment around the blacksmith's shoe. 

Or wheels, pieces of wheels, parts of buggies, and things of that nature that would pile up that he could use. Because he did other things besides just shoe horses. He would fix plows and sharpen moral points and sharpen axes and things of that nature. 

Did he still make wheels? No. He made wheels earlier. Earlier I think he made wheels because the upper portion of the blacksmith's shop was in a deteriorated condition. He used it for storage, but he would never let us go up into the upper portion of it. 

But apparently he didn't make wheels there. I've seen him fix wheels there, but I never did see him make any wheels there. But this was a direct route for us to go to the village to these stores. We would go down East Fairfax Street, buy the blacksmith's shop, and cut through the Falls Church to guard. 

The Falls Church yard to go to the store. Where was the store? Well, there were several stores there. Henderson had a, which was a black family, had a grocery store that was sort of on the hill. On Washington Street? 

It would be on South Washington Street now. On the East side of South Washington Street? It would be on the East side of South Washington Street. And near where the old Henderson house used to be? Yes, it would be. 

In fact, I guess one part of the family lived in the store and the other part lived in the house adjacent to that store. What was the store there where this, where Makis's, Bakis's reed? I would think that the store would be, the store would have been up on a bank. 

where the hobby shop is. No, it was pretty close to the road, but you had to go up a series of steps to get to it. No, the house, the store would then be adjacent to the Falls Church, and then it was a house that would be between that and between the store would be right where that little driveway goes in. 

Right, about there. That was right at the edge of the church ground. Very close to the church ground. And then, of course. Was that just a little one-room store? It was a one-room store. The sold groceries and candies and things of that nature. 

But there were, Brown's hardware store was there, and they also sold groceries in those days. It was sort of a mixture of clothing, hardware, and groceries. They still sold groceries there when I came here in 1947. 

I'm sure they did. Then, Abbotts had a grocery store there that where most everybody in this whole area actually got their groceries. So they had everything. That's the one that, yeah, eventually was brought, Abbotts sold to Dawkins. 

Rebecca Dawkins became an EGS store. On the corner, actually, where it became famous now, I guess, because it looked so bad, but on that corner, in the southeast corner of Broad Street, Sam Poho's operated a grain and feed store. 

Across the street was a drugstore. There, that was part of our building. right into part of a house almost all the stores people lived and used lived in. They were living quarters plus a store then lunches the post office for snacks and then next to that lunch on the sort of cars and who were raised there. 

And adjacent to that was a small house that was Abbott's lived in. And adjacent to that was the store that Mr Abbott operated and the people lived in that store. Across the street that would be on the south side of Broad Street gone west. 

There was a real estate office, a bank, these were all framed by the new church. They lived there, had a home. There was another, just to go to the front of the west, sales of having a store where they sold dry cords. 

And then just the rest of that was another home and they were on up. That was old Dr Lloyd's home? I don't know whose it was but there was a two-story house. It was a two-story house right then from there to the next building. 

Thanks for watching! 

## Historical Context

Harry E. Wells (born c. 1920s) served as the City Manager of Falls Church for nine years (c. 1963-1972) after previously working as the City Clerk from 1948-1963. His interview provides valuable insights into Falls Church during the 1920s-1970s, spanning a period of significant transition from a semi-rural community to a suburban municipality.

The Wells family moved to Falls Church in 1922, and Harry grew up on East Fairfax Street. His recollections document several important aspects of Falls Church history:

1. The evolution of transportation infrastructure, noting that East Fairfax Street was a dirt road through the 1920s, accessible primarily by horse-drawn vehicles in poor weather
2. The presence and importance of the Harmon Blacksmith Shop, a vital local business serving the agricultural community
3. Changing land use patterns as orchards and small farms gave way to residential development
4. Educational patterns of Falls Church residents, with many attending schools in Washington D.C.
5. The discovery of a previously unknown blacksmith shop site, indicating the area's earlier economic activities
6. The transition of local governance as Falls Church evolved into an independent city

As a long-term city employee and later City Manager, Wells had a unique perspective on Falls Church's development and governance during a crucial period of growth and change. His memories of Harmon's Blacksmith Shop provide particularly valuable documentation of a business that represented the area's agricultural heritage before suburban development.

Additional significant historical insights from this interview include:

1. **Blacksmith Operations**: Wells provides detailed descriptions of Harmon's Blacksmith Shop operations, including that it was a two-story frame building where the blacksmith not only shoed horses but also fixed plows, sharpened "moral points" (likely mouldboard plows) and axes, and repaired wheels and buggies. The shop was particularly busy during snowy days when farmers couldn't work their fields. The interview reveals that an assistant named Henry Simms, described as a Black man, worked with Harmon, indicating the racial dynamics of local businesses during this period.

2. **Commercial Landscape of Early Falls Church**: Wells describes a vibrant commercial district including:
   - Henderson's grocery store (operated by a Black family) on the east side of South Washington Street
   - Brown's hardware store that also sold groceries and clothing
   - Abbott's grocery store (later sold to Dawkins and became an EGS store)
   - Sam Poho's grain and feed store at the southeast corner of Broad Street
   - A drugstore, post office, real estate office, and bank
   - A store selling "dry cords" (likely dry goods)

3. **Residential Integration**: The interview mentions Colbert Hunter, a Black resident who built his house after World War II. Wells also mentions that Hunter's mother (referred to as Mrs. Hunter, now Brown) lived in a house set back from the road, indicating the presence of Black families and property owners in the Falls Church community during this period.

4. **Educational Institutions**: Wells describes attending what is now the Washington House for his first three years of school, then Madison School through 7th grade. He notes that many Falls Church residents attended Washington D.C. schools if their parents worked in the district, as there was no tuition requirement. He mentions that his sister Shirley was the only one in his family who graduated from "Old Jefferson High School" on Cherry Street, suggesting the development of local educational infrastructure over time.

5. **Property Development Patterns**: The interview details how Wells' father rebuilt their house at 216 East Fairfax Street on top of the existing stone foundation, replacing a deteriorated frame house while preserving elements of the original structure. This pattern of incremental development and reuse of existing structures offers insights into how Falls Church's built environment evolved.

6. **Agricultural Heritage**: Wells describes their three-acre property as a "truck farm" with 24 apple trees, 5 sour cherry trees, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, allowing the family to "live very well, right off of the farm." He notes that Mr. Harmon, the blacksmith, had planted the orchards, suggesting the intertwined nature of various occupations in the early community.

7. **The Church as Central Landmark**: Wells mentions using the Falls Church yard as a shortcut to reach local stores, indicating how the historic church building served as both a physical and cultural landmark in the community's geography.

8. **Mixed-Use Buildings**: The interview reveals that most stores in early Falls Church were combined with living quarters, with proprietors typically living in the same buildings where they conducted business. This pattern of mixed-use development differs significantly from later suburban commercial development.

9. **Archaeological Discoveries**: The discovery of an old blacksmith shop site and an "Emmy Church druggist" bottle during excavation suggests the layered history of Falls Church, with earlier commercial activities being built over as the community evolved.

These details collectively depict Falls Church in transition from a rural village centered around agricultural services to an increasingly formalized municipality with established governance structures and diversifying land uses. Wells' perspective bridges the gap between personal experiences of early Falls Church and professional oversight of its later development as a city.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This oral history interview offers several points of relevance to the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Pre-suburban Character**: Wells' detailed descriptions of the rural nature of East Fairfax Street in the 1920s demonstrate Falls Church's historical identity as a small village surrounded by agricultural land. His mentions of horse-drawn vehicles, dirt roads, and farming activities show how recently the area maintained its connection to its agricultural past.

2. **Historical Infrastructure**: The descriptions of blacksmith shops, including the previously undocumented one discovered on the Wells property, highlights the economic infrastructure that supported the area's agricultural character. These businesses were essential services in small communities like Falls Church.

3. **Land Use Evolution**: Wells' account of his family's property, which included apple trees, cherry trees, and various other crops, documents the transition from agricultural to residential land use, providing context for how Falls Church evolved from its historical roots.

4. **Community Identity**: As someone who served in city government for over two decades, Wells' perspective on community development helps establish how Falls Church's identity evolved during the mid-20th century, which is relevant for understanding how place names and community identity interrelate.

5. **Historical Preservation Values**: The interview itself represents efforts to preserve Falls Church history through oral testimony, demonstrating the community's long-standing interest in maintaining connections to its past - a value that also underlies the current renaming initiative.

While this interview does not directly mention "Little Falls," it provides essential context for understanding Falls Church's historical character during a transformative period, reinforcing the initiative's goal of reconnecting the community with its authentic historical identity. The interview helps establish the agricultural and small-town character that defined Falls Church before suburban development transformed the landscape.
