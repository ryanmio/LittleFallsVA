 NOTES ON THE EVOLUTION OF VIRGINIA BRICKWORK FROM

 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TO THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY

 Calder Loth, Architectural Historian
 The Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission

 Much can be learned about the age, quality and history of a

 building through an examination of its brickwork. The numerous illus-
 trations presented here are an attempt to demonstrate the changing char-
 acter of brickwork styles in one state over a period of some two hundred
 and fifty years, and to contrast these styles, to some degree, with
 those of other regions of the nation. Virginia, with its rich legacy of
 brick architecture, is an excellent area in which to conduct such a
 study. Not only are some of the nation's oldest brick buildings located
 in Virginia, the varied cultural backgrounds of her settlers provides
 for a wide assortment of regional brickwork types. Brick was virtually
 the only masonry material available in the earliest period of settlement,
 thus a strong tradition of brick architecture developed at the outset.
 It should be noted that many of the comments presented with

 the illustrations are broad generalizations. Exceptions to what is said
 can be found for any period and any region. Early brick masons were
 individuals, and as such were subject to quirks, whims and special
 influences just like anyone else. They had a freedom to express them-
 selves through their craft that does not exist today. Most Virginia
 masons, however, veered little from the norm of the day, and their work
 is more standardized than one might expect. Thus, the more one observes
 Virginia buildings of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth
 centuries, the more the broad generalizations seem to hold up.

 Although studies of brick manufacturing and local brickwork

 styles have been conducted, very little has been written concerning the
 evolution of American brickwork over a long period of time. Information
 is especially lacking for nineteenth century brickwork styles. As a
 result, many of the comments presented here are based on personal obser-
 vation, rather than on documentary evidence. In most cases, the con-
 clusions were arrived at by the simple correlation of dates and locations
 of various buildings with their brickwork styles.

 It should be noted at the outset that individual brick dimen-

 sions can tell very little about the age of either the brick or the build-
 ing in Virginia. Except for the small, so-called Dutch bricks (see Fig. 1)
 which occasionally are found in archaeological excavations of seventeenth
 century sites, nearly all bricks of the period discussed follow the same
 general proportions. The basis of these proportions can be traced to
 what Nathaniel Lloyd in his History of English Brickwork termed the
 "Flemish brick." The Flemish brick, Lloyd noted, was in use in England
 in the thirteenth century. With only minor variations its dimensions
 were 9" x 4 1/4" x 2 1/4", which are the same as most Virginia bricks of
 the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The proportions

 of the Flemish-size brick were governed by two factors: (1) the largest
 amount of wet clay a man can comfortably lift with one hand and throw
 into a mold, and (2) the size and shape of rectangle that is most comfort-
 ably grasped with one hand while working a trowel with another.

 Standards for brickwork sizes, or statutes, were set up in

 England from time to time, and these standards varied only slightly from
 the Flemish brick size. No official regulations requiring Virginia
 masons to adhere to size standards have been found, however. Occasion-
 ally early contracts or minutes will specify that bricks for an indivi-
 dual building be dimensioned according to statute, but the references
 are so scarce, and the statute size varies so little anyway, that practi-
 cally no assistance for dating purposes is provided by such references.
 Most of the minor variations in dimension and proportion resulted from
 a combination of variations in individual mold size, clay quality, and
 shrinkage from firing, not from any changes in statutes or guild regula-
 tions that can be correlated with specific dates. Practically the only
 method one can use to assign a general period to an individual brick is
 through identification of its process of manufacture, and that would
 apply only for the nineteenth century. Much more useful information for
 dating purposes is derived from a brick's context rather than from the
 brick itself.

 Enough has already been written to dispel forever the oft-heard

 claims of early buildings being built of bricks imported from England.
 It would only be repetitious to present the arguments against these
 claims in this article. It is sufficient to say that no one has yet
 found convincing documentary evidence of a Virginia building being
 erected of bricks imported from England. The author must admit, however,
 that he would be delighted with the discovery of such evidence.

 All photographs are from the archives of the Virginia Historic Landmarks
 Commission, and were taken by its staff between 1968 and 1974.

 These small bricks, found in a chimney base of a mid-seventeenth century
 post house, are what are referred to as Dutch bricks. They measure
 6 1/2" x 3" x 1 1/2", have a yellowish color, sandy texture, and are
 poorly fired. Such small yellow bricks are frequently found in seven-
 teenth century sites, although no standing structure built with them
 survives in Virginia. Dutch bricks are the one variation in brick size
 that can serve as a general dating guide.
 Richard Neve's Builder's Dictionary (1736 edition) describes Dutch bricks
 in England thusly: "I am informed that they are 6 1/4n. long, 2 1/2
 broad, and 1 l/4n. thick; another tells me they are 6n. long, 3n. broad,
 and ln. thick;... They are of a yellowish color.... They are commonly
 used here in England, to pave Yards and Stables withal, and they make a
 durable Pavement, and being laid Edge-wise, look handsomely, especially
 if laid Herring-bone fashion."

 The lining of the cellar of what archaeological evidence indicates was
 a mid-seventeenth century post house is laid in English bond with Dutch-
 size bricks. The individual bricks measure 7 1/2" x 3 1/2" x 1 1/2",
 and are made of red clay rather than the more usual yellow clay.

 Fig. 3 (left) Wishart House, Virginia Beach, Va. (c. 1680)

 In Virginia, English bond, or courses of stretchers (sides of bricks)
 alternating with courses of headers (ends of bricks) was used mainly
 during the seventeenth century. Whole walls of English bond are rarely
 seen on buildings erected after 1710's.
 Note in the example illustrated that the courses are not consistently
 all headers or all stretchers; corrections with odd-sized bricks were
 often necessary to prevent the vertical joints from aligning. Glazed
 headers occur in English bond only randomly, although several buildings
 survive with glazed header courses. The walls of the Wishart house are
 laid entirely in English bond.

 Fig. 4 (right) Jamestown Church Tower, James City County, Va. (c. 1647)

 The church tower is one of the earliest datable examples of English bond
 in Virginia. Note that it is used both above and below the ovolo water
 table. Typical of seventeenth century English bond the tower employs
 from ten to fifteen percent glazed headers. The individual brick size
 is 8 3/4" x 4" x 2 1/4".
 The illustration was made during a recent archaeological investigation
 of the tower's foundations.

 Fig. 5 (left) Bacon's Castle, Surry County, Va. (c. 1660)

 This famous Jacobean-style manor house is Virginia's finest example of
 seventeenth century brick architecture. The building is laid entirely
 in English bond with scattered glazed headers. The curvilinear gable
 ends are a unique survivor in this country, although others, such as in
 Province House, Boston, are known to have existed. Rubbed or gauged work
 is not used, it is rarely found in buildings erected before 1700.

 Fig. 6 (right) St. Peter's Church, New Kent County, Va. (nave erected 1701)

 English bond is employed in the nave of St. Peter's both below and above
 the water table, although three courses of Flemish bond appear just above
 the water table. One might conclude that the mason was dubious about
 using a "modern" bond and lapsed back into the more familiar English bond
 as his work progressed. The bricks are among the largest in any Virginia
 building and measure, 9" - 9 1/4" x 4 1/2" x 4". Most colonial bricks are
 rarely more than three and a half inches high, although the nine inch
 length is not uncommon.

 Farnham Church, Richmond County, Va. (1737)

 From the mid-seventeenth century to the mid-eighteenth century English
 bond usually was retained below the water table. It was preferred in
 the foundation area primarily because of its strength -- it is some
 twelve percent stronger than Flemish bond. Even when English bond was
 used in conjunction with glazed-header Flemish bond, the unglazed
 headers were turned outward.

 Fig. 8 (right) Clifton, Cumberland County, Va. (c. 1750)

 English bond was used just as consistently for the foundations of frame
 buildings as it was for brick buildings, although Flemish bond is more
 often found in the foundations of finer frame houses dating from the mid-
 eighteenth century on.

 Fig. 9 (left) Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House, Richmond, Va. (1808-09)

 This Richmond townhouse exhibits a very late use of both English bond
 and a water table. Although neither feature was utilized much after
 the 1780's, its use here may indicate that the building was erected by
 a conservative or elder mason. The English bond in the retaining wall
 is less unusual, however. It was the preferred bond for retaining
 walls throughout the eighteenth and most of the nineteenth centuries.

 Fig. 10 (right) Reconstructed seventeenth century Dutch style farmhouse,

 Van Cortland Manor, New York

 The wall of this reconstructed house is laid in Dutch Cross bond, also
 called English Cross bond, which is a variant of common English bond.
 In cross bond the stretchers are not vertically aligned with one another
 in every other course as in common English bond. Instead, each stretcher
 is centered with vertical joints in the stretcher courses above and below.
 This manner of laying bricks produces continuous diagonal stepped patterns
 in the joints throughout the wall. Cross bond was favored among Dutch
 masons and was widely employed in the colonial buildings of New York.
 No early example of cross bond has been found in Virginia.

 Fig. 11 (left)

 Yeocomico Church, Westmoreland County, Va. (1706)

 On several Virginia buildings, particularly certain ones erected around
 1700, little attempt was made for a consistent bond throughout the wall.
 The result was a confused pattern, sometimes called "haphazard bond."
 In the south wall of Yeocomico Church English and Flemish bonds are run
 together, and in several courses consistency breaks down entirely. Alter-
 nating glazed headers even appear in some of the header courses. Note
 the crude pilaster to the left of the doorway.

 Fig. 12 (right)

 Ware Church, Gloucester County, Va. (first quarter 18th
 century)

 Flemish bond (headers alternating with stretchers in every course) was
 used in Virginia from the mid-seventeenth century through the mid-nine-
 teenth century. The colonial mason made his stretchers fall on center
 with the headers above and below them by placing a small brick bat, or
 queen closer near one end of every course. In nineteenth century Flemish
 bond king closers (a brick approximately two-thirds the length of a
 stretcher) gained in favor over queen closers. King closers fall at the
 corner of a building rather than one header in as with queen closers.

 Fig. 13 (left) St. Luke's Church, Isle of Wight County, Va. (mid-

 seventeenth century)

 Flemish bond was introduced into England from the Continent around 1600,
 and it was being used in Virginia by the mid-seventeenth century.
 Except for its buttresses, St. Luke's Church is laid entirely in Flemish
 bond (even below the water table). The church may represent the first
 instance in English building where true Gothic architecture and Flemish
 bond were combined. The building illustrates how conservative the
 colonists remained architecturally, yet how up-to-date they were in build-
 ing techniques.

 Fig. 14 (right) Pungoteague Church, Accomack County, Va. (1738)

 Glazed or vitrified headers were employed in Virginia Flemish bond from
 the late-seventeenth century to the mid eighteenth century. The early
 kilns as well as the temporary clamps were fired with oak and the potash
 in the oak caused a chemical reaction in the clay which resulted in the
 blue-gray glaze. (The headers were glazed because they were placed closest
 to the fire.) The glazed ends were selected to face outward in the wall to
 emphasize the checkered effect of Flemish bond. The example illustrated
 is interesting for its use of glazed queen closers, as well as for its use
 of unglazed headers and closers below the water table.

 Colonial bricks were formed in wooden molds which were dusted with sand

 to prevent the damp clay from adhering to the wood. This gave the
 bricks a granular face. The inconsistency of both the clay quality and
 the firing heat caused the bricks to have rough, irregular edges. As a
 consequence it was difficult to have neat, even mortar joints. To cause
 his jointing to appear more regular the colonial mason used a steel rod
 and straight-edge to tool both the horizontal and vertical joints with
 a thin groove. These grooved joints are termed scored, rodded, or some-
 times grapevine joints. They are found in most all but the roughest
 colonial brickwork.

 Fig. 16 (right) Malvern Hill, Henrico County, Va. (late-seventeenth

 century)

 In Virginia, glazed headers were used primarily to emphasize the checkered
 effect of Flemish bond; only rarely were they used to form special designs
 such as diapering, herringbone, dates or initials. The two concentric
 diamonds in the chimney of the ruins of Malvern Hill form one of the few
 early examples of diapering in the state. Glazed patterning is much more
 common in Maryland and New Jersey.

 The gable of Yeocomico's porch chamber employs a diamond of glazed headers,
 as well as a line of glazed headers following the edge of the gable. This
 latter feature is relatively common on pre-Georgian Virginia buildings.
 Note the unique trefoil-like motif above the doorway and the inscribed
 brick panel between the trefoil and the diamond.

 Fig. 18 (right) Pear Valley, Northampton County, Va. (c. 1660)

 The brick gable of Pear Valley illustrates the use of chevroning, or
 parallel rows of glazed headers following the line of the gable. Chev-
 roning is especially prevalent on the Delmarva peninsula where Pear Valley
 is located. The use of a corbeled cornice stop is a typical seventeenth
 century feature, and is rarely employed after the 1720's.

 Fig. 19 (left) Brooke's Bank, Essex County, Va. (c. 1751)

 The chimneys of Brooke's Bank exhibit a rare mid-eighteenth century use
 of diapering. Instead of the more normal outlining of the diamond with
 glazed headers, the entire diamond is glazed.
 The word diaper meaning a square or diamond shape is derived from Ypres,
 the Belgian city which during the Tudor period exported to England a
 special square-cut cloth. The cloth was called d'Ypres and the term was
 eventually corrupted to diaper appertaining to square or diamond shapes.

 Fig. 20 (right) Alexander Withrow House, Lexington, Va. (c. 1790)

 Diapering is sometimes found on late-eighteenth century and early-
 nineteenth century houses in the Shenandoah Valley, in the western part
 of the state. Introduced by settlers from Pennsylvania it also is found
 on a number of houses of the same period in western North Carolina and
 the midwest.

 Fig. 21 (left) Rosewell, Gloucester County, Va. (begun 1726)

 Some of the finest examples of colonial Flemish bond in Virginia, most
 notably Rosewell and Christ Church, Lancaster County, employ only scattered
 glazed headers. This gives the wall a sparkling quality as opposed to the
 flat effect of a wall devoid of glazing. Rosewell is the only Virginia
 building to employ panels of rubbed brick, or aprons, beneath the windows,
 a device common on Queen Anne period buildings in England. (The illustrated
 section of Rosewell's north wall was largely destroyed in the summer of
 1972).

 Fig. 22 (right) George Wythe House, Williamsburg, Va. (1752)

 Glazed headers ceased to appear in most Tidewater Virginia brickwork by
 the mid-eighteenth century. An explanation for this phenomenon is that
 by the 1750's most of the stands of oak, especially around Williamsburg,
 had been depleted, and other woods such as pine had to be used to fire
 the brick kilns. Instead of the beautiful blue-gray glazes, pine gave
 headers only a smutty look which was considered undesirable. As a result
 the tendency was towards a more even-colored wall with the headers being
 selected to match the stretchers. The Wythe House in Williamsburg and
 Carter's Grove, James City County (1750-55), are early examples of major
 houses having no glazed headers. Concurrently, glazed headers passed out
 of fashion in England by the 1750's.

 Fig. 23 (left) Morrison House, Harrisonburg, Va. (c. 1822)

 While glazed headers generally disappear from use in the mid-eighteenth
 century, they reappear in some isolated late-eighteenth century build-
 ings. Second growth oak in eastern Virginia allowed for the production
 of some glazed bricks in this period, but their use was never widespread.
 Most examples of post-Revolutionary Flemish bond with glazed headers are
 found in the Shenandoah Valley. The Morrison House, which employs con-
 sistent glazing up to the second floor level is one of the latest known
 examples.

 Fig. 24 (right) House at 421 South Second Street, Philadelphia, Pa.

 (c. 1790)

 Flemish bond with glazed headers was used consistently in and around
 Philadelphia into the early-nineteenth century. The persistence of this
 tradition accounts for glazed work being found on buildings erected by
 settlers of Pennsylvania origin in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Compared
 with the glazed-header Flemish bond found in the Tidewater section of
 Virginia, Pennsylvania brickwork has a more regular, almost mechanical
 appearance. This regularity resulted from improved brick manufacturing
 processes that were available in large cities.

 The facade of Williams Ordinary is one of the less than a half-dozen
 known examples of header bond in Virginia. As its name implies, header
 bond employs headers consistently in every course. Batty Langley regarded
 header bond as "especially beautiful."* In America, header bond is common
 only in Maryland where numerous examples are found. Most of the finer
 townhouses of Annapolis and Chestertown have header bond facades with the
 remaining walls in either Flemish or English bond. Being located in a
 Potomac River port town, Williams Ordinary may have been erected by Mary-
 land masons.

 give an impression of strength to a place of detainment. The side and

 This distinctive chimney stack is a unique example of all-glazed header
 bond. The blue-gray mass of the glazed headers is set off by the light-
 red rubbed brick corners. The corbeled cap with string course is a
 typical finish for colonial chimney caps.

 Fig. 28 (right) George Wythe House, Williamsburg, Va. (1752)

 Because handmade colonial bricks had irregular edges, obtaining sharp,
 even lines at jambs and corners offered a problem. The problem was
 solved with the use of rubbed bricks. Rubbed bricks were made from less
 thoroughly burned bricks called samels. The samels were a lighter red
 than ordinary face bricks and were rubbed very smooth with either a hard
 brick or stone. When set in corners a side and end of the samel had to
 be rubbed to produce the desired sharp edge. Note the lighter color of
 the rubbed bricks framing the Wythe House doorway.

 Fig. 29 (left) Carter's Grove, James City County, Va. (1750-55)

 Rubbed bricks cut and rubbed into special shapes to fit in either flat,
 segmental, or semi-circular arches are called gauged bricks. Fine
 gauged work is a hallmark of colonial Virginia masonry; it illustrates
 the high level of craftsmanship achieved by the colonial bricklayers.
 Properly laid gauged flat arches or jack arches were always composed of
 wedge-shaped bricks with the vertical joints aligned with radii from a
 common point. The Carter's Grove jack arches are two stretchers deep,
 and feature two queen closers in every other course. The more standard
 jack arches of the Wythe House follow a stretcher/header - header/
 stretcher pattern.

 Fig. 30 (right) Tower Hill, Northampton County, Va. (c. 1746)

 This damaged jack arch illustrates that the arches actually supported
 only the face brick, and concealed a wooden lintel which supported the
 main part of the wall over the opening. Deep jack arches are rare on
 basement windows and are employed only on better quality buildings.
 Usually basement windows are topped by a simple rowlock segmental arch.
 When gauged segmental arches are employed in basements they are rarely
 more than a stretcher deep.
 Tower Hill has the high water table typical of colonial Virginia planta-
 tion houses; the scale figure stands 6'2".

 The jack arch above the main entrance of this Rappahannock River planta-
 tion house features a scrolled soffit that is unique in Virginia.
 Scrolled soffits of this type are relatively common in England, especially
 on buildings of the Queen Anne period, but are exceedingly rare in America.
 The c. 1732 section of Holly Hill in Anne Arundel County, Maryland has
 fine examples of scrolled soffits.

 This detail of a fallen jack arch, with a 25? coin for scale, illustrates
 the thinness of the mortar joints in gauged work. The width of gauged
 work joints varies from 1/16" to 1/8". The joints were made with a white
 lime putty, or a mortar with little or no sand. The joints of gauged
 work are often called buttered joints.

 Fig. 33 (left) Christ Church, Lancaster County, Va. (1732)

 The semi-circular arches of Christ Church illustrate gauged brickwork at
 its best. The fine brickwork is emphasized by the stone keystone and
 imposts. Detailed instructions for laying out gauged arches were avail-
 able to the colonial mason in English handbooks such as William Halfpenny's
 The Art of Sound Buildin& (London, 1725).
 The brickwork of Christ Church is virtually identical to that of Rosewell,
 (Fig. 21) suggesting that the two buildings had a common mason.

 Fig. 34 (right) Records Office, Williamsburg, Va. (1748)

 Gauged bricks were often cut or molded for use in architectural trim,
 primarily frontispieces. The lack of good building stone in the Tide-
 water section of Virginia encouraged the use of such elaborate brickwork
 details. The Records Office pediment illustrates that the colonial
 masons were quite capable of producing correct academic details from the
 materials available.

 The beautiful south entrance of Lamb's Creek Church shows a colonial
 gauged-brick frontispiece at its most refined. Pilasters and pediment
 have been reduced to their barest essential elements without being
 overly simplified. The doorways of Christ Church, Lancaster County,
 on the other hand, feature richly molded pediments, broken cornice,
 dentils, pulvinated frieze and molded architrave.
 Note the lack of any glazing in Lamb's Creek's walls. As previously
 noted, glazing had passed out of fashion by the third quarter of the
 eighteenth century.

 Fig. 36 (right) Pear Valley, Northampton County, Va. (c. 1660)

 Because of its resistance to heat, brick has always been an ideal material
 for fireplaces and chimneys. The pyramidal chimney on Pear Valley is one
 of the earliest of Virginia chimney forms; it is rarely found on buildings
 erected after the 1710's. The steeply sloped haunches or weatherings are
 tiled, i.e. covered with bricks with the flat faces slanting to form a
 smooth, weather-resistant surface. The frieze between the corbeled cap
 and the string course shows traces of its original white plastering which
 was a common treatment for colonial chimney caps.

 Fig. 37 (left) Winona, Northampton County, Va. (late-seventeenth century)

 Winona and Bacon's Castle possess the only surviving sets of seventeenth
 century diagonally-set chimney stacks in America. The base and caps of
 Winona's stacks are ornamented with hound's tooth courses which are made
 of projecting corners of bricks. Hound's tooth (also called mouse tooth)
 courses were employed occasionally on pre-Georgian buildings but rarely
 on later ones. They return to fashion in the early-nineteenth century,
 however.

 Fig. 38 (right) Wishart House, Virginia Beach, Va. (c. 1680)

 The exterior-end chimneys of the Wishart House use a T-shaped stack which
 was a common form for chimney stacks from the late-seventeenth century
 through the 1730's. T-shaped stacks occur both on exterior and interior-
 end chimneys. Note the characteristic use of two sets of tiled weather-
 ings. The white plaster band below the cap is a common decoration for
 early colonial chimney caps. The string courses used to frame the
 weatherings are rarely seen on buildings erected after the 1710's.

 arch which helped secure the roof against the chimney. It also served
 as a waterproofing feature.

 Ellis House, Surry County, Va. (c. 1800)

 Like bonds and other motifs, the chimney forms of Virginia buildings
 change considerably after the Revolution. The more standard exterior-
 end chimney of the early and mid-nineteenth century has a straight-
 sided breast and only one set of weatherings. The weatherings are
 usually always stepped rather than tiled. The stack is a narrow
 rectangle rather than the more square one of the colonial period.
 Three and five-course American bond was preferred over Flemish.

 Fig. 42 (right)

 Hanover County Courthouse, Hanover Court House, Va.
 (c. 1735)

 The foundations of colonial brick buildings were thickened on the
 exterior, and the top of the projection, or water table, was capped
 with shaped bricks designed to shed moisture. The standard finish for
 a water table was one course of beveled rubbed brick laid in Flemish
 bond as on the Hanover Courthouse. Variations employ quarter-round
 and ovolo bricks.

 Water table bricks on Virginia buildings were always laid horizontally.
 New England water tables, on the other hand, generally were composed of

 House. A standard shape for colonial New England water tables was an
 ogee curve.

 Brooke's Bank, Essex County, Va. (1751)

 Most colonial two-story brick houses in Virginia employed a projecting
 belt or string course to delineate the floor levels. Belt courses most
 often were composed of two or three courses of rubbed brick with buttered
 joints. Molded belt courses as on Brooke's Bank are rare. The use of
 brick belt courses all but ceased after the Revolution, although high-
 style Federal houses frequently have stone belt courses.

 West Lawn between Pavilions VI and VII, University of
 Virginia, Charlottesville, Va. (1817)

 Three-course American bond, (sometimes called three-course common bond,
 and sometimes Liverpool bond) consists of a course of headers alternating
 with three courses of stretchers. It was considered economical rather

 than decorative and is found primarily in secondary walls, foundations,
 and chimneys. Almost never was it employed on Virginia buildings erected
 before the 1780's.

 Brick bonds with two courses of stretchers to a course of headers are all

 but non-existent in Virginia. They were not favored because the vertical
 joints tended to align.

 In contrast to Virginia, three-course American bond appears on a
 number of early and mid-eighteenth century buildings in New England.
 (In New England it is usually referred to as common bond.) The brick
 end walls of the Short House are laid in three-course common and
 employ simple two-course belt courses laid in Flemish bond. Note the
 use of odd headers in the stretcher courses to prevent alignment of
 vertical joints.

 Fig. 48 (right) Gadsby's Tavern, Alexandria, Va. (1752)

 A form of common or American bond is sometimes found in the party walls
 of colonial structures in Virginia towns. The temporarily exposed party
 wall of Gadsby's Tavern has an irregular ratio of stretcher courses to
 header courses, but stretcher courses predominate.

 The corner of this northern Virginia church illustrates the characteris-
 tic use of three-course American bond for side walls, and Flemish bond
 for the facade. Note the use of queen closers at the ends of the header
 courses.

 The two header-size holes in the brickwork in the center of the upper
 half of the illustration are putlog or putlock holes which were used to
 support the mason's scaffolding. Most putlog holes were filled as part
 of the normal completion of construction, but occasionally the mason
 didn't bother to fill them.

 During the 1820's five-course American bond (five courses of stretchers
 to a course of headers) supplanted three-course American bond as the
 preferred bond for side and rear walls. It was more economical and
 could be laid quicker than three-course work. The use of five-course
 bond in Virginia persisted into the late-nineteenth century.

 This example illustrates the use of five-course American bond in an
 exterior-end chimney. The brickwork is particularly well executed;
 five-course work usually was not laid with such care. The use of
 tiled weatherings for a chimney of this date is most unusual; tiling
 rarely was employed in chimneys erected after the Revolution.

 Fig. 52 (right) Townhouse, Church Hill, Richmond, Va. (c. 1870)

 Seven-course American bond (seven courses of stretcher to a header
 course) came into use after the Civil War, particularly in urban areas.
 It was used most often in conjunction with veneered pressed brick facades.
 Because pressed bricks were smaller than the common stock bricks used in
 the seven-course work, the facade bricks could not be bonded directly
 into the side walls. A method frequently employed to tie the two types
 of brick together was an irregular quoining system as shown in the illus-
 tration.

 Fig. 53 (left) Yeaton-Fairfax House, Alexandria, Va. (c. 1805)

 Although American bond became popular for side and rear walls after the
 Revolution, the use of Flemish bond for facades persisted well into the
 nineteenth century. In Virginia, Flemish bond of the early Federal
 period has a quite different character from the pre-Revolutionary Flemish
 bond. Improved methods of brick manufacture, available especially in
 growing urban areas, produced bricks much more consistent in size, tex-
 ture and color. The tendency, therefore, was towards a very even,
 precise surface, as opposed to the textured appearance of the colonial
 wall. Instead of the scored joint, a very regular flattened bead became
 standard on better-quality Flemish bond.

 Fig. 54 (right) Farmers' Bank, Petersburg, Va. (1817)

 At its best, Flemish bond of the Federal period has its vertical joints
 consistently thinner than its horizontal joints. In the examples illus-
 trated the beaded vertical joints are V-shaped because they were too
 thin to flatten.

 Fig. 55 (left) Rotunda, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

 (1822-26)

 Thomas Jefferson engaged Philadelphia masons for the more refined brick-
 work at the University of Virginia. He was so impressed by Abia Thorn's
 work on the Rotunda walls that in writing a recommendation for him he
 stated: "...I believe more beautiful and faithful work has never been
 done in any country."*
 One can better appreciate the quality of Thorn's work as shown in the
 illustration when it is recalled that the Rotunda's walls are circular.

 Rotunda, by William B. O'Neal (Charlottesville, 1960).

 Fig. 56 (right) Ampthill, Cumberland County, Va. (c. 1835)

 Even by the second quarter of the nineteenth century many rural houses
 in Virginia were still being constructed of brick burnt in temporary kilns
 or clamps set up on the site. These bricks, of course, did not have the
 precise edges and smooth surfaces of the bricks produced in commercial
 urban brickyards. The rural mason, however, wanted his building to look
 up-to-date, and carefully selected his bricks for evenness of color.
 Ampthill possesses notably good Flemish bond for a rural house. Typically,
 its mason did not attempt the fine beaded joint of city buildings, but
 used a simple flush joint instead.

 Fig. 57 (left) Farmhouse, Franklin County, Va. (early nineteenth

 century)

 The colonial mason attempted to compensate for the irregularity of his
 bricks and jointing by scoring the mortar joints. This practice was
 given up after the Revolution in favor of painting the joints with a
 fine white line. This example illustrated employs irregular, granular
 surfaced bricks produced in exactly the same manner as colonial bricks,
 but the resulting uneven mortar joints are given visual regularity by
 being painted or penciled with a white line.

 Fig. 58 (right) Sussex County Courthouse, Sussex Court House, Va. (1828)

 In many early-nineteenth century brick buildings, especially rural ones,
 the walls were painted red and the jointing white. The motive was to
 achieve the appearance of uniform color and even jointing in order that
 the building would look as though it were constructed of the same fine
 quality bricks found in city buildings. Painting also served to mask
 unwanted glazed headers that might appear in the walls. In The American
 Builder's General Price Book and Estimator by James Gallier (Boston, 1836),
 a price of 3a per yard is quoted for "Brick fronts painted one coat, and
 the joints drawn white."
 Sussex County Courthouse retains its original red paint and whitened joints.
 Such original painted walls should be identified and preserved whenever
 possible.

 Fig. 59 (left) Goochland County Courthouse, Goochland Court House,

 Va. (1826)

 The side walls of Goochland County Courthouse are laid in a variation of
 American bond that is somewhat awkwardly termed common or American with
 Flemish. This variant came into fairly widespread use in the early
 nineteenth century and was used throughout the remainder of the century.
 The bond is similar to three-course American except that instead of all-
 header courses at three-course intervals, a course of alternating headers
 and stretchers is used. This can occur at intervals of five stretcher
 courses as well.

 Fig. 60 (right) Mahonia Cottage, Page County, Va. (c. 1830)

 A regional variation of Flemish bond that occurs primarily in early-nine-
 teenth century buildings in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia
 is called staggered Flemish bond. Staggered Flemish does not have its
 headers centered above and below the stretchers as in ordinary Flemish.
 Instead the headers are staggered one above the other resulting in a
 pattern of vertical stripes. Staggered Flemish is found only on facades.
 The example illustrated is unusual in that it employs consistent glazed
 headers.

 Fig. 61 (left) Montcalm, Washington County, Va. (1827)

 Rubbed and gauged work on Virginia houses erected after the Revolution
 is virtually non-existant. This can be explained by the fact that the
 colonial bricklayers' guilds required an apprenticeship period of seven
 years, and during that period the apprentice spent much of his time both
 rubbing bricks and shaping them for gauged work. After the Revolution
 the apprenticeship period was reduced to only two years, thus depriving
 the master mason of most of his manual labor. The master mason couldn't

 afford to spend his own time rubbing brick, so he quit using it.
 In contrast with the standard gauged jack arch of colonial times, the
 flat arch above the windows in the Federal house illustrated is composed
 regular-size bricks in a soldier and rowlock course.

 Fig. 62 (right) Riddick House, Suffolk, Va. (1837)

 Even in fine ante-bellum buildings with excellent Flemish bond, no attempt
 was made at gauged work. The flat arch below the belt course in the
 Riddick House is composed of regular-size bricks forced to fit in a pattern
 for which they were not shaped. The result appears crude and sloppy when
 contrasted with the fine workmanship in the Flemish bond.

 century)

 The difficulty of obtaining neat brick arches after the Revolution
 forced masons to turn to other methods of finishing the tops of openings.
 Stuccoed jack arches became popular, as well as stone or wood rectangu-
 lar lintels and iron hood moldings. Often the brick bond was carried
 over the head of the opening with no attempt at a structural motif.

 The hound's tooth course (composed of projecting corners of diagonally
 set bricks) was a motif of the late-seventeenth century and returned to
 use in the early-nineteenth century. It was employed mostly on non-
 academic houses and outbuildings.

 While most early-nineteenth century Virginia bricks were finished with
 the standard granular surface, many sophisticated buildings such as
 Upper Bremo and Thomas Jefferson's buildings at the University of
 Virginia were faced with oiled bricks. Oiled bricks had very smooth
 surfaces as the brick molds were lined with copper and wiped with lin-
 seed oil rather than dusted with sand. Upper Bremo is one of the
 earliest documented examples of the use of oiled bricks in Virginia.

 Stretcher bond (uniform courses of stretchers throughout the wall) came
 into general use just prior to the Civil War. Early stretcher bond is
 bonded to the backing brick by specially cut bricks set on a diagonal.
 Later stretcher bond is more like a veneer and employs bricks of a diff-
 erent size and quality from the backing brick. Such brick veneer is
 tied to the backing brick with metal tabs. The illustrated example is
 of handmade brick probably produced on the site. It retains the original
 paint on the joints.

 This Greek Revival townhouse has unusually beautiful stretcher bond walls.
 The very precise bricks were probably formed in metal molds, and referred
 to as Baltimore stock bricks in an early description of the house. This
 type of brickwork is characteristic of fine mid-nineteenth century town-
 houses and public buildings in most eastern cities.

 Fig. 70 (right) Townhouses, W. Main Street, Richmond, Va. (c. 1890)

 Brick veneers of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries almost
 universally employed pressed bricks. Pressed bricks are made with a
 stiff clay that is forced into metal molds under very high pressures, and
 are burnt in gas-fired kilns. Compared with handmade bricks they are
 very hard and have a consistent density. Buff-colored pressed bricks,
 which are made from a clay with magnesia and alumina, are as common as
 red pressed bricks made from ferric oxide clays.

 Late-nineteenth century brickwork, not only in Virginia but throughout
 the nation, developed into a very elaborate art. Exuberant examples
 of Victorian brick ornamentation can be found even on the most ordinary
 type of building in most any American city.

 The author is grateful for the many pieces of valuable information
 relating to Virginia brickwork acquired in conversations with Edward F.
 Heite of the Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs, State of
 Delaware, and with Paul Buchanan of the Architectural Department of the
 Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.
