 THE STATUS OF WOODLAND PREHISTORY

 IN THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION

 R. Michael Stewart

 Contributions made to Woodland period research in the region in recent years

 are summarized. These are presented in conjunction with an outline of cultural trends
 and developments.

 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

 This paper attempts to summarize the current status of Woodland period research in the Middle Atlantic

 Region (Figure 1). I present what I believe are representative advances in light of existing cultural historical

 and interpretive frameworks. In no way can the citations presented in this paper be considered as exhaustive

 for a particular topic or period. The references that are cited, however, provide starting points for any journey

 through the massive literature, both published and on file in various state and agency repositories. What

 follows includes a reaffirmation of longstanding interpretations of aspects of regional prehistory, some new

 perspectives on old data, and a sampling of new data that are transforming the ways in which we think about
 the past 3000+ years.

 NATURE OF THE RESEARCH

 It is difficult to present a litany of traits and trends that accurately characterizes all cultures throughout

 the Middle Atlantic Region during the Woodland period of prehistory. And that's good, maybe even great
 for the intellectual health of the region. But it is also not so good.

 It's good because the extent of research that has been completed is revealing the great diversity of

 prehistoric cultures that existed in the region. We are documenting a variety of solutions to common problems

 faced by prehistoric hunters and gatherers, and later farmers. We are seeing more clearly how human ecology

 is tempered by individual historical traditions, and the vagaries of the human decision-making process. The
 burgeoning data base itself represents an appreciable advance, providing basic information on site distribu-

 tions, site age, and stylistic affinities that was not available 10-15 years ago. Discussions regarding ter-
 ritoriality, intra- and inter-regional relationships, population replacements and migrations are being made
 with more confidence.

 The downside of the situation stems from the pace xof development-driven archaeology, or cultural

 resource management studies (CRM). As I write this summary, I am painfully aware that I probably haven't

 seen all of the best or latest CRM technical reports whose contributions have yet to make their way into the

 mainstream literature. Conducting research on tight schedules and budgets leaves little time for reflection,

 generalization, and synthesis between projects. This is an interesting paradox since determining site or resource

 significance in the context of the Section 106 process, or in any legal compliance situation, requires an
 understanding and synthesis of data in local, regional, and ever-broadening frameworks. Beaudry et al.

 assessed the overall status of CRM work in the Northeast (including the Mid- Atlantic states) in 1986. It would

 be useful to update this review. Some State Historic Preservation offices (SHPO) have put their site files into

 computer data bases, making continuing attempts at regional synthesis a little less daunting. Occasionally,

 survey and planning monies have been used by SHPOs to fund syntheses of existing data (e.g., Custer 1986a;
 Hay et al. 1987).

 In fact there are dozens of fairly recent syntheses that cover one or more segments of Woodland

 prehistory, or topics for all, or large portions of the region (e.g., Curry and Kavanagh 1991; Custer 1984a,
 1986b, 1989a; Gardner 1982a, 1986; Geier et al. 1983; Hummer 1991; Kent 1984; Kraft 1986; MacCord 1989;

 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994a;Thomas 1987; Thurman 1985; Wall 1981). These publications represent a great

 leap beyond the status quo of 1 5 years ago. Roger Moeller initiated the Journal of Middle Atlantic Archaeology

 in 1985, in part to provide an outlet for the plethora of papers and summaries of CRM work that never made

 it past presentations at state and regional meetings. The literature dealing with Middle Atlantic Region

 archaeology has matured, or at least grown tremendously, and it will take the serious student quite some time

 to wade through it.

 A variety of regional and state meetings have included sessions that presented the "state of the art" for

 the Early, Middle, or Late Woodland periods. The 1982 Middle Atlantic Archaeological Conference considered

 both the Middle Woodland and Early Woodland periods (select papers published in Moeller 1982), the status

 of Late Woodland studies was assessed in 1983 (papers published in Custer 1986b) and again in 1994, and

 a symposium at the 1989 meeting tackled the Middle to Late Woodland transition (various papers published

 in volume 1 1 and 12 of North American Archaeologist). The 1991 meeting of the Society for Pennsylvania

 Archaeology covered Early Woodland times, and the special conferences organized by the Virginia Council
 of Archaeologists have addressed the entirety of Woodland prehistory (Reinhart and Hodges 1991, 1992).
 Useful topical and period syntheses also can be found in state plans compiled by some State Historic
 Preservation Offices (e.g., Chesler 1982; Custer 1986a; Fuerst 1988; Raber 1985). On occasion, large CRM
 projects will contain detailed syntheses which form the basis of their research designs (e.g., Fischler and
 Mueller 1988; Kavanagh 1982; Kingsley et al. 1990; Mouer et. al. 1985; Stewart and Cavallo 1983).

 Approaches

 There are relatively few explicit statements regarding the theoretical basis on which regional archaeology

 has developed, or continues to proceed. Custer (1980, 1984:21-22, 1987a, 1987b, 1989a:23-25), Carbone
 (1982), Gardner (1982b), and Mouer (1990) represent perspectives firmly grounded in what can be described

 as an up-dated cultural ecology, an approach which adds systems theory and a variety of materialist, social,

 and evolutionary views to the concept as originally outlined by Julian Steward (Steward and Murphy 1977).

 This perspective implicitly permeates most technical reports resulting from CRM studies, and the archaeologi-
 cal literature for the region as a whole. Handsman (1982) provides a cogent summary of the history of
 archaeological perspectives in the Middle Atlantic Region through 1982, as well as a critique of the cultural
 ecological/processual bent of the "new" archaeology.

 Few (save for Handsman 1987) have questioned the impact that the social milieu in which we practice
 our craft has had on the way in which the prehistoric past is viewed. An elegant essay by Joe Dent (1991)

 dealing with Paleo-Indian studies shows how post-processual and critical approaches in archaeology can build

 and expand our traditional views of extant data, and narratives of regional prehistory. The language and ideas

 of the post-processual/critical debate are making their way into the literature and CRM reports of the region
 (e.g., Jirikowic 1990). The Plenary Session at the 1991 meeting of the Middle Atlantic Archaeological
 Conference, organized by Joe Dent and Christine Jirikovic and dealing with engendering archaeology, is one

 example of this trend. The perspective of the past 10-15 years is not being abandoned, but expanded. The

 time constraints under which most CRM projects labor, however, ensures that the more accessible and easy
 to use ecological/materialist/evolutionary approach of the past will persist into the near future. More efforts
 following Dent's (1991) lead are needed to achieve anew synthesis.

 Not all prehistoric cultures participated equally in the changes that provide the greatest contrasts in
 regional lifeways through the Woodland period. As Handsman was able to lament in 1982, "we have
 underestimated the degree of variability within and between regions" (1982:95). Generalizing across the
 Middle Atlantic Region is difficult, not only because of the degree of cultural diversity that is now evident,

 but also because of the quantity of data that have accumulated, and continue to pile-up as a result of CRM
 studies. It is difficult to continue to organize Woodland prehistory in terms of the traditional subdivisions

 of early (1200/1000 B.C. - 600/500 B.C.), middle (600/500 B.C. - A.D. 800/900), and late (800/900 A.D. -

 European Contact), if these divisions are to be anything more than chronological mileposts. Even these

 divisions may not strike all readers as representing a traditional scheme, which emphasizes my point and

 explains my hedging of the noted dates. This type of difficulty is to be expected. The prehistory/history of

 cultures and societies is a continuous thing. We introduce abruptness and discontinuity, albeit unconsciously
 at times, by using concepts like cultural historical periods.

 A number of attempts have been made to redefine the archaeological units that are used to talk about

 the prehistoric archaeology of areas within the Middle Atlantic Region (e.g., Custer 1984a, 1989a; Gardner

 1982c? 1986; Mouer 1990, 1991). In these schemes, the coincidence of material culture, common adaptations,

 and the bounded environmental systems in which they occur are used to segment prehistory and serve as the

 basis for examining cultural evolution.

 Nonetheless, generalizing about the prehistory of a region requires eschewing detail at some level in

 order to realize common ground, or overlaying some arbitrary framework for organizing discussions. In the
 following, I use traditional chronological mileposts and discuss the common ground and variability seen
 between them. Whether the units Early, Middle, and Late Woodland associated with the mileposts remain
 viable as summaries of trends in lifeways for all areas within the region, remains to be seen.

 "Woodland" has traditionally embraced everything from the first appearance of ceramics to the time

 of European contact. The longstanding interpretation of the Early and Middle Woodland is that along with

 the use of ceramics, communities become more sedentary, there is related development of social complexity,

 intensive focus on a select number of wild plant and animal foods, and experiments with plant domestication
 and gardening. These trends culminated during Late Woodland times with the acceptance of maize-based
 agriculture, settled village life, and continued elaboration of social organization. I hope .that the reader can

 appreciate the dynamic tension in the presentation that follows regarding whether these statements still hold
 as even a large-scale outline of Woodland prehistory.

 Technical/Methodological Trends

 I think that it also is important to acknowledge some of the practices of the past 10-15 years that have

 aided our ability to deal with the material evidence of the past. They reflect, in large part, the types of data

 required by the perspectives outlined above.

 Geomorphological and pedological studies as an element of archaeological investigations have progressed

 to a wondrous degree, providing an independent source of information on the age, formation, and integrity
 of archaeological deposits. Understanding the evolution of landscapes has also led to an understanding of
 why we have had trouble finding or recognizing sites of a,particular age - we weren't digging deep enough,
 or in the right places, or the lack of natural deposition was making it hard to stratigraphically separate

 occupations. This may be part of the problem we have with finding or recognizing occupations dating between
 A.D. 200 - 700/800 in areas other than the Coastal Plain and eastern Piedmont. While most archaeologists

 understand the rationale for geomorphic studies, many CRM survey-level projects (Phase I) still suffer from

 a lack of integration of this information in field strategies, especially when non-floodplain settings are
 involved.

 The contribution of geomorphic/pedologic/sedimentological studies to paleoenvironmental reconstruc-
 tions has been dramatic, in my opinion (but see Joyce 1988). Models of climatic change and cycles of

 landscape stability have been proposed, tested, and reformulated for large areas within the region (e.g., Curry

 and Custer 1982; Strighi 1990; Vento and Rollins 1989; Vento et al. 1990). This body of work offers a view
 of paleoenvironments complementary to the one provided by pollen studies. Palynological and other
 paleoenvironmental studies continue to be performed in conjunction with archaeological projects (e.g., Brush
 1991; McWeeney 1990; Russell 1985), but not to any dramatic degree.

 Large area excavations are in wide use, upgrading our knowledge of site structure and activity areas.

 Without the funding available to CRM studies, it is doubtful that such a trend in technique could be
 consistently realized. The stripping of large areas of plowzone sites following sample excavations has also
 become a widespread practice as part of Phase II and III CRM projects. In some instances, this practice simply
 has demonstrated redundancy in the nature and distribution of subsurface features, something that could be

 inferred from the results of thoughtful sampling procedures, and a limited number of test excavations. In other

 cases, however, variety in community patterning has been revealed. Most significantly, the stripping of large
 areas of plowzone from shallow sites has revealed that low density artifact deposits can be associated with

 habitation sites containing structures and a variety of pit features (e.g., McLearen 1991). All too often, low

 density plowzone assemblages are interpreted as the fingerprint of transient and ephemeral human activities.

 This practice especially is changing the way that we view Early Woodland settlements. For a variety of
 reasons, Middle and Late Woodland sites traditionally have been the focus of large-scale excavations and
 areal exposures.

 The use of flotation has become a consistent part of excavation strategies. It has provided information

 useful for studies of everything from subsistence, to lithic technology, to site formation processes (e.g., Moeller
 1992).

 The number of radiocarbon-dated components in the region has grown considerably. A few compilations

 of these data exist (Boyce and Frye 1986; appendices in Custer 1984a, 1989; Gleach 1985; Herbstritt 1988;

 Inashima 1992a; Klein 1994a). One significant result of this accumulation of data has been the re-segmenting

 of traditionally defined cultural historical periods. There is now a greater appreciation of the nature of cultures

 and cultural change over time for areas within the region where such segmenting has been possible (e.g.,
 Shenandoah and James River valleys of Virginia; Delaware River valley of Delaware, southeastern
 Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; coastal sections of the Potomac River drainage in Maryland and Virginia).
 Radiocarbon dates have supported the refinement of both ceramic and projectile typological sequences

 traditionally used to anchor shallow and disturbed sites in time. Typological variety within individual
 assemblages has been noted for projectile points in some areas (e.g., Custer and Bachman 1984; Hummer

 1991), and a system for dealing with typological variety across the region has been proposed (Evans and Custer
 1990). For example, long, narrow-bladed and stemmed points that could be lost in any Late Archaic
 Lackawaxen assemblage are clearly appearing in Early Woodland contexts and with ceramics in the Delaware

 Valley (Hummer 1991:Plate 12; Mounier, 1995 personal communication; Payne 1990; Stewart 1986, 1987a).
 Teardrop-shaped points are consistently appearing with Early Woodland ceramics and radiometrie dates in

 the Coastal Plain (e.g., Barse 1985; The Cultural Resource Group, Berger and Associates 1992; Mounier and
 Martin 1994), although similar artifacts have been found in contexts ranging from Middle Archaic to Late

 Woodland in age. Side-notched and triangular-bladed projectiles are also associated with the Early Woodland

 period and early ceramics. Variously identified as the Meadowood and Hellgrammite types (compare Hummer
 1991; Kraft 1989), they also overlap with the morphology of the Late Archaic type, Brewerton Eared-Notched
 (Ritchie 1971). Triangular projectiles, once thought to have been exclusively associated with the Late
 Woodland period in the Middle Atlantic, have been recovered from deeply stratified and dated Archaic
 contexts (Cultural Resource Group, Berger and Associates 1992; Stewart and Cavallo 1991).

 Ceramic typologies have been refined and are becoming more area-specific, although regional trends

 remain discernible (e.g., Klein 1994b; Mouer et al. 1986; Stewart 1985). Gardner (1982) and Custer (1987a,
 1987b) discuss ceramic developments and trends for the region as a whole. Experiments with ceramic
 technology occur throughout the region (to various degrees) at least by 1200 B.C.. Evidence continues to

 mount suggesting that the technology appears one to two centuries earlier (e.g., Bressler et al. 1983:27-28,
 30; Emanco, Inc. and New World Research 1988; Waselkov 1982; Weed 1991).

 Ceramic studies in general have shown that suites of types or combinations of attributes, characterize

 the assemblages of individual groups in many areas (e.g., Custer 1987c; Hatch 1983; Stewart 1985). This

 variety has been seen as a reflection of inter-group contacts, and potters' responses to the availability of clays

 and tempers in different portions of a group's exploitative territory. It is beyond the scope of this paper to
 provide a compendium of redefined, newly defined, and dated types. It is notable that the longevity of shell-
 tempered Mockley and related wares, seen in the Coastal Plain from the Carolinas to New York (Stewart 1992;
 Thurman 1985), has been extended from A.D. 200 to A.D. 800 (Custer 1989a; Stewart 1987b). The final twist

 of cordage used in the surface treatment of pots is an attribute receiving wider attention in ceramic studies.

 It has been used in arguments related to defining group territoriality and the relationship between look-alike
 wares (Johnson 1989; Maslowski 1984), and as a means of exploring the sexual division of labor within a

 group (Johnson and Speedy 1990).

 On the downside, there are still substantial gaps in typological sequences for any artifact class for many

 interior areas (Appalachian sections of the region's major river drainages) for the time between A.D. 200 and
 A.D. 800. This is a critical lack, since it prevents us from seeing the sites, people, and processes leading up

 to the early, consistent use of maize and farming-oriented communities in these areas during Late Woodland
 times. The overlap of projectile morphology and disparities in dating noted above have the potential to
 confound the use of surface assemblages in regional studies of settlement patterns.

 Work has begun on the construction of a paleomagnetic curve for the region (Frank Vento, Clarion
 University of Pennsylvania, personal communication 1990) using clay and sediment samples from
 radiocarbon-dated contexts. Not only is our control over time being upgraded, but the cost of this control is

 coming down. The cost of running a paleomag sample is easily half that of the standard radiocarbon date.

 No one yet has attempted to apply thermoluminescence dating (TL) to the aeolian sediments that are found

 throughout the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain, and are responsible for the burial of numerous archaeological
 deposits. TL dating of ceramic assemblages, however, has been attempted (e.g., Fokken et al. 1987).

 A dendrochronology sequence based on white oak and extending to circa A.D. 1400 exists for the
 Delaware Valley (Ed Cook, Lamont Doherty Laboratory, Columbia University, personal communication
 1994). Initially developed during the study of standing historic structures in Philadelphia, it has yet to be

 employed in archaeological studies. Similar sequences could be developed for other portions of the region.
 The issue is whether or not such an endeavor would be worthwhile, given the rarity with which substantial

 pieces of wood charcoal are preserved on sites. Partial sequences encompassing historic times have been
 constructed for sections of Maryland (Timothy Riordan, Historic St. Mary's City, personal communication

 1 994) and Pennsylvania (Bonzani et al. 1 99 1 ).

 Investigating the natural origins of lithic raw materials used for the production of artifacts has also

 advanced considerably in the recent past (see summary in Stewart 1989; Bergman et al. 1992; Hatch 1993;
 LaPorta 1994; Reeves et al. 1991; Stevenson et al. 1990, 1992). The benefits of these analyses in terms of

 reconstructing settlement movements and networks of trade and exchange have not yet been fully realized.

 Sourcing or provenance studies have also been attempted for ceramics (e.g., Klein 1990; Mouer 1985).

 Replicative experiments have become a fairly typical component of technological analyses of lithic
 assemblages. Blood residue analysis is providing another perspective on tool use (Custer et al. 1988; Hyland
 et al. 1990; Inashima 1992b; Petraglia et al. 1993).

 EARLY WOODLAND: CIRCA 1200/1000 B.C. TO 600/500 B.C.

 Are Early Woodland lifeways more than a Terminal Archaic adaptation with a few traits added to the

 basic inventory of material culture? One of the classic hallmarks for initially defining the overall Woodland

 period is the use of ceramics, which is seen as a reflection of not only technological change, but of changes
 in settlement patterns (see Gardner 1982a and Custer 1987c for developmental summary). A semi-sedentary

 lifestyle has been viewed as a pre-condition for the adoption of the new technology, owing in part to the

 logistics of ceramic manufacture and the relatively fragile nature of clay pots, in contrast to other kinds of
 containers. The earliest experiments with ceramics in the region occur during what would chronologically
 be defined as the Transitional or Terminal Archaic. Ceramics have been found in association with Broadspear

 and Fishtail-type projectiles, and soapstone bowls. This is not a new observation (cf. Kinsey 1972:45 1). There

 are few who would argue that Terminal Archaic settlement patterns did not involve some degree of sedentism.

 yet not replicated by investigations of Late or Terminal Archaic components. These settlements can probably
 best be described as hamlets, although Mouer (1991 :3 8-39) has documented one Early Woodland site in the

 James River valley of Virginia that has all of the trappings of what could be considered to be a village, i.e.,
 it has a wide variety and high densities of artifacts and features, and extends over a large area. Evidence of
 dwellings is also found on sites occuppied for only a short period of time (e.g., Figure 3; Custer and Bachman

 1984) (Figure 3). At present it is impossible to say how typical these sites are of the region as a whole,

 although the noted evidence spans portions of the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia.

 There is no question that ceramic technology is a noteworthy innovation. But I would argue that its initial

 impact on native society was not revolutionary, nor equally shared across the region. For thousands of years
 prior to the appearance of pottery, or the appearance of stone bowls for that matter, Native Americans

 possessed a container technology based in many mediums - skin and hide bags, wooden vessels, and basketry.
 They are obviously cooking, although through indirect means, with these containers. Granted, ceramic

 containers allow you to cook in different ways. But. the relatively low numbers of Early Woodland ceramic

 vessels/sherds found on sites makes it doubtful that early pottery revolutionized the container technology
 of the time. Yet on a smaller scale, areas where early ceramic vessels appear in profusion and in a variety
 of shapes and sizes (Figure 4) can be identified (e.g., Barse 1990; Fokken et al. 1987; Mouer 1990, 1991).

 The cyclical reuse of individual sites, evident during the Terminal Archaic, continues into Early
 Woodland times. This has been interpreted as evidence of scheduled settlement movements tied to subsistence

 pursuits, which take place within a fairly well defined territory. There is a hierarchy of settlement types,

 inferred from the size of sites, the density of artifact deposits, and the variety of artifact classes (and by
 implication activities or behaviors) represented. This, too, is an elaboration of a Terminal Archaic trend or

 pattern, thought to represent the periodic gathering and splintering of band segments.

 This general pattern, however, masks a variety of differing settlement systems influenced by environmen-

 tal and resource diversity within the region (Figures 5 and 6; cf. Cavallo 1987; Custer 1984a:75-l 13; Gardner
 1982a:56-65; Mouer 1991:47-65). Differences in settlement and community patterning, and variability in

 the diversity and richness of biological resources in the region, imply that native society was organized in

 a variety of ways. Modelling of social organization for this time has not gone beyond distinguishing micro-
 band and macro-band types of settlements.

 The basic inventory of what was hunted

 and gathered seems little different from a listing
 of Archaic food resources, with variations

 depending on the physiographic province in-
 volved. What remains uncertain is the relative

 importance of individual foods to the overall
 diet. It has been inferred from the location of

 sites, increased levels of sedentism, and evi-

 dence of storage that groups may have focused

 on a somewhat narrower range of highly pro-
 ductive resources, e.g., anadromous fish, nuts,

 shellfish, large mammals, seed and tuber pro-
 ducing plants. Whether such changes in subsis-
 tence technology involved a reorganization of

 work at the family or community level remains

 a matter of untested speculation.

 Evidence for involvement of regional
 cultures with plant cultivation is inferential at
 best. There is no direct evidence for domesti-

 cated plants in the region at this time. Pump-
 kin/squash seeds {Cucurbita pepo) occur in
 Early Woodland deposits at Meadowcroft
 Rocksheiter (Adovasio et al. 1981:72), located
 in the Ohio River valley section of western
 Pennsylvania. Plant cultivation and domesti-

 people of these areas and those inhabiting the
 Middle Atlantic Region can be inferred (see

 below), but this is not a reasonable basis for assuming that experimentation with plant cultivation took place
 sast of the Appalachians.

 Evidence of widespread trade and exchange reveals connections both within and outside of the region

 Stewart 1989:56-57). Exchange is both broad-based, involving down-the-line, web-like networks, and
 focused, involving closer connections between two specific geographic areas. Models of exchange that have
 Deen proposed (Custer 1984b, 1984c; Stewart 1989, 1994b) have yet to be thoroughly tested, or their
 mplications fully explored.

 Curiously, the volume of exchange during the Early Woodland seems to decline from what it was during
 earlier times, at least from the perspective of imperishable artifacts whose raw materials can be traced back

 o natural sources. This pattern would not be expected in light of trends in sedentary settlements. Ex-

 change/trade is one way to maintain access to goods and information when you are no longer willing, or able,
 o move around the landscape yourself.

 The segmenting of the Early Woodland by Gardner (1982a, 1986) and Mouer (1990, 1991), and the

 lefinition of cultural complexes by Custer (1984a, 1989a) that span the same time, are more accurate gauges

 )f cultures and events than previous schemes. The recognition of cultural diversity is not sacrificed and general
 rends can still be discerned in each of these frameworks.

 Williams and Thomas (1982) provide coverage of the Delaware Valley in northern sections of the region.
 Custer's (1984a, 1989a) book-length works on prehistory are applicable to Middle Woodland times in
 Delaware, adjacent sections of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and the Delmarvã Peninsula. The work of Curry

 and Kavanagh (1991), Kavanagh (1982), Steponaitis (1986), Stewart (1980, 1983), Wall (1981), and Wanser
 (1981) provide coverage of large portions of Maryland. The collected works in Reinhart and Hodges (1992)
 are an excellent place to begin a review of Middle Woodland research in Virginia. Other wide-ranging
 coverage for applicable portions of the state can be found in Gardner (1986), Geier et al. (1983), Johnson
 (1991), Potter (1982, 1993), and Waselkov (1982). Custer (1988), Gardner (1982a), Stewart (1992), and
 Thurman (1985) consider the time from a more regional perspective.

 The time between 600 B.C. and 400 B.C. is a critical one, and traditionally has been used by many as

 a break between Early and Middle Woodland, or as a dividing line in frameworks eschewing traditional labels.

 Expressions of burial ceremonialism, mound building^ and caches of trade goods are noted for this time in
 some portions of the region. Many of these phenomena persist, or appear sporadically from this early time

 to A.D. 1, and possibly as late as A.D. 200. While the recognition of the basic phenomena are nothing new,
 the ways in which they are being interpreted reflect theoretical trends of the past decade.

 Stone and earth burial mounds in the Ridge and Valley section of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland

 are one such case (Gardner 1982a, 1986, 1993; Stewart 1981, 1992:16-19). Relatively recent excavations
 into remnant mounds have resulted in one new radiocarbon date (circa 430 B.C. - Gardner 1982a:70, 1993)

 for the early end of the phenomena. This is fairly consistent with the early dating of Adena-related mounds

 and sites in western Pennsylvania and the panhandle of West Virginia (McConaughy 1 989, 1 99 1 ). The Middle

 Atlantic mounds are only vaguely comparable to those of Ohio Valley cultures, and the artifacts found within

 them fail to match the range of materials, variety, or quantities seen in the Ohio Valley sites.

 The Middle Atlantic mounds are

 viewed as focal points in networks of
 small communities. Gardner (1982a: 72)

 has argued that there is a hierarchical
 arrangement in mound clusters and
 associated hamlets, and that this pat-

 terning may reflect the ranking of lin-
 eages within the larger Middle Wood-
 land society of the area. The sex and
 age of individuals accorded mound
 burial, and inferences regarding the role
 of mound burial in social interactions

 are seen as evidence of a complex,
 tribal society (Stewart 1992:18). Much
 fieldwork still needs to be done on

 habitation sites of the period to fully
 integrate the social/ceremonial argu-
 ments outlined.

 Custer (1989a:249-275) and
 Thomas (1987:37-41) provide updated
 descriptions and interpretations of
 Delmarva Adena, located primarily on
 the Coastal Plain of Maryland and
 Delaware. Like the burial mound phe-
 nomena noted above, Delmarva Adena

 transcends both early and later seg-
 ments of the Middle Woodland. Gard-

 ner (1982a:70-77) and Thurman (1985:
 17-20) also examine Delmarva Adena
 in their regional syntheses of Middle
 Woodland trends, and Stewart
 (1989:57-59) examines the distribution

 cemeteries with exotic trade goods, as well as caches of similar types of artifacts found away from the
 cemeteries. Comparable phenomena are seen more sporadically in coastal New Jersey and are referred to
 as Adena-Middlesex (Charles Bellows, Archaeological Society of New Jersey, personal communication 1995;
 Kraft 1986:98; Mounier 1981; Stewart 1989:57-58; Thurman 1985:18-19). A more isolated example is found
 in the Upper Delaware Valley (Kraft 1986:98-104). Most researchers agree that Delmarva Adena/Adena-
 Middlesex is not the result of an intrusive culture or migration (but see Kraft 1986:98).

 Speculations regarding the nature of Delmarva Adena society parallel those made for the burial mound

 complexes of the interior (Custer 1989a:264-275; Gardner 1982a:71-72). A hierarchy of cemeteries can be
 defined on the basis of site size and degree of material wealth as measured in trade goods (Custer 1989a:265;
 Gardner 1982a:74). Some form of social ranking and supra-local organization of communities is implied.
 Custer (1989a:256-275) is able to link habitation and other sites with the more flamboyant expressions of

 Delmarva Adena culture (Figure 7). He argues that the settlement system shows a clear continuity with those

 of earlier times, and that the development of a more complex social organization is also based on earlier trends

 in which adaptations to rich, but circumscribed environments and population growth play important roles.

 Custer's discussion of Delmarva Adena is the most detailed in terms of addressing what factors spurred

 thesfe experiments in social complexity and are relevant in outline to the mound-building cultures of the Ridge

 and Valley. I think that it is important to recognize that these phenomena are experiments since they do not

 possess continuity over a long period of time, and they do not lead to even more complex forms of native
 society. Certainly, some form of contact with cultures in the Ohio Valley and circum Great Lakes area is part

 of the equation. It is interesting to note that after 600/500 B.C. there is a dramatic increase in the quantity
 and areal distribution of trade items that originated outside of the Middle Atlantic Region (Stewart 1989:57).

 But we are not seeing the importation of a new way of life. What we need to understand is the nature of the
 contact and influence; there is some coincidence of world view that makes the cross-cultural use of symbols
 and ritual behavior viable.

 Changes in the way that work was organized (the production of subsistence) may be at the developmental

 core of these social experiments, specifically the management of cooperative subsistence pursuits rather than

 the traditional "every family for itself approach. What was hunted, collected, and eaten may not have changed,

 but how, when, and by whom food was procured, processed, and distributed may have been transformed.

 Reliance on managers and cooperative work sows the potential seeds of social inequality, and the role that

 trade plays in such developments has been repeatedly demonstrated. That these Middle Woodland expressions

 of social complexity don't give rise to more fully realized, ranked society implies that there is no long term,

 positive feedback for the socio-cultural system. There remain other options for exploiting desired resources,

 and the cultural landscape had not filled to the point where the consolidation and cooperation of communities

 was the best or only way to make a living. In light of this, we should consider the possible role of charismatic

 leaders in the development and maintenance of the Ridge and Valley mound building cultures and Delmarva

 Adena. What also remains unexplored is the effect that the developments outlined above may have had on

 surrounding cultures.

 By 500/400 B.C. net-impressed ceramics are found throughout the Coastal Plain and into the Piedmont

 (Custer 1987c; Egloff and Potter 1982; Gardner 1982a:68; Stewart 1985, 1987b; Thurman 1985). The regional

 "connectedness" of coastal ceramic traditions is even more evident after A.D. 200 and extending to A.D. 800,

 with the appearance of net-impressed and shell-tempered Mockley pottery and related wares. The pervasive

 occurrence of Mockley ceramics throughout the Coastal Plain continues to represent a truly impressive feature
 of regional archaeology (Thurman 1985:20), even though there is considerable variation in ceramic
 assemblages within the same area (Custer 1987c; Egloff and Potter 1982; Mouer et al. 1986; Stewart 1985).

 Using ceramics in conjunction with lithic utilization, settlement, and subsistence data, a number of authors
 have attempted to define group territories (e.g., Custer 1984a, 1989a; Egloff 1985; Gardner 1982a; Mouer
 et al. 1986; Stewart 1985) (Figure 8).

 What is implied when certain ceramics and ceramic attributes from such a broad region are so identical?

 We do not fully understand the nature of the personal or group interactions that make such phenomena
 possible, or at least the archaeological residue of this behavior. In fact, the nature and context of ceramic
 production has not been addressed. Exchange systems seem comparable to those of earlier times (Stewart

 1989). A reduction in the overall volume of exchange involving lithic artifacts originating within the region,
 and moving through broad-based networks, is evident between 400 B.C. and A.D. 200. This trend is reversed

 after A.D. 200, and persists until approximately A.D. 800. It is most evident in assemblages associated with

 Fox Creek/Selby Bay and related biface styles, and the ceramics that co-occur with them - Mockley and its

 cognates. The major flow of goods is from west to east, and then south and north along the Atlantic coast.
 Higher population levels have been inferred which would stimulate interactions. The nature of economic
 pursuits on the Coastal Plain also serves as a basis for interaction among large groups of people.

 size and depositional intensity
 of large group sites on the
 Coastal Plain (Gardner 1982a).
 Large ceramic vessels are also

 more typical of assemblages in
 coastal areas (e.g., Barse 1990),

 and are probably a reflection of

 the intensity of the resource processing and storage that is taking place, as well as a greater number of people
 sharing cooked meals. Either groups are gathering on a seasonal basis to exploit coastal resources, or these

 large coastal sites are the locus of relatively sedentary and large settlements. Available evidence can support
 either scenario.

 Against this settlement/subsistence backdrop and the pan-coastal distribution of Mockley ceramics, the

 spotty distribution of unusual zone-decorated pottery (Figure 9) provides additional hints at geographically
 extensive interactions. Originally discovered at the Abbott Farm Complex in coastal New Jersey, it also
 appears on a handful of sites in coastal Virginia (see Custer 1987c: 109-1 11; Stewart 1982, 1985, 1992 for

 review of data). The designs are executed on what is typically a Móckley ceramic paste, and the ware occurs

 in greatest concentrations on major lowland sites that also produce the more typical Mockley pottery. The

 history of use of zone-decorated pottery seems to parallel that of Mockley, A.D. 200 - A.D. 800 (Stewart 1985;

 but see Gleach 1988). Klein (1994a:20-21) has recently reported radiocarbon dates for zone-decorated pottery
 for two of the Virginia sites, A.D. 420+/-80 (44PG40) and A.D. 850+/-60 (44NK166).

 Figure 9. Examples of zoned, incised decorations seen on pottery from the Abbott Farm. Source: Cross 1956.

 I have proposed (Stewart 1992) that the highly decorated ceramics functioned in public ceremonies,

 perhaps feasting, related to the gathering of groups during the intensive seasonal focus on fishing and shell

 fishing. The feasting bowls of Northwest Coast societies are one very general ethnographic analog for this
 proposition (Drucker 1963:80-81; H. Stewart 1982:159). Ceramic designs have been viewed as one means
 of communicating social messages (Braun and Plog 1982). To be effective, of course, the designs have to
 be seen. In some way, the elaborate designs on the zone-decorated pottery provided a symbolic message to
 the gathered groups. A small number of these pots were probably presented as gifts to members of the

 assembled groups, eventually being discarded at the end of their useful lives at settlements far from the locus

 of the original gathering.

 The occurrence of zone-decorated ceramics or related imitations in Virginia implies some direct
 connection/interaction between Middle Woodland peoples from opposite ends of the Middle Atlantic Coastal

 Plain. That the decorations never enjoy more widespread use, even by the groups who were familiar with
 them, is further testimony of the pottery's role in strictly defined public ceremonies or activities. One could

 almost imagine the seasonal gatherings and the specialized use of the zone-decorated pots as a mechanism
 used to express solidarity among Algonquian peoples.

 The increasingly sedentary nature of settlements through the Middle Woodland is a trend originating

 in earlier times. Sedentism does not seem to be dictated solely by the nature and potential of the resource

 base found in a given environment, since it characterizes settlement systems throughout the region. It is

 basically one option for adapting to a variety of situations, in an elaboration of the way that Binford (1980)

 differentiates between hunter-gatherer collecting and foraging systems (Steponaitis 1986; Wiessner 1982).

 It can also be understood as a response to perceived population densities, changes in the way that subsistence

 activities are organized, shifts in economic focus, or as part of a group's strategy for controlling a territory
 (see Steponaitis 1986 for cogent review of the issues). Even so, intra-regional variability in settlement and

 community patterns is evident, as it was during the Early Woodland (cf. Blanton 1992; Custer 1984a, 1989a;
 Gardner 1982a; McLearen 1992; Potter 1982, 1993; Stewart 1990, 1992; Waselkov 1982).

 Data on subsistence is best known for coastal areas and there is a clear connection with the practices

 of earlier times (cf. Barber 1992; Custer 1988; Waselkov 1982; Whyte 1988). Based on data from Virginia,

 through the Middle Woodland period there is a reduction in the overall variety of the types of shellfish used,

 although this food source is exploited at all times of the year (Custer 1988: 130; Egloff et al. 1988; Potter 1982;
 Waselkov 1982).

 Middle Woodland folk certainly had some knowledge of domesticated crops given the known dates for
 maize and other cultigens in the broader region (Adovasio et al. 1981; Barfield 1990; Gleach 1985; Smith

 1995). Mouer (1989) argues that coastal peoples had been "farming" or selectively nurturing the starchy and

 carbohydrate-rich roots and tubers found in swamps and marshes. The introduction of tropical domesticates

 did little to alter coastal adaptations since rich and predictable sources of plant foods were a traditional part

 of the subsistence system. Conversely, in the Piedmont where naturally abundant sources of similar plant
 foods are lacking, the adoption of cultigens had a more visible effect on both settlement and subsistence

 systems. In the Shenandoah Valley, shifts in the location of sites within the floodplain are construed as a

 reflection of the importance of plant foods during Middle Woodland times (Gardner 1986:73-74). Comparable
 shifts within western sections of the region cannot be seen owing to a lack of data on sites and cultures of
 late Middle Woodland times.

 There is the possibility that migrations and population replacement may have affected portions of the

 Middle AtlantiC'Region. Based primarily on linguistic data, Fiedel (1987, 1990) identifies two waves of proto-
 Algonquian migrations through the region sometime between 600/200 B.C. and A.D. 300/700. This work

 refines and updates the earlier research of Luckenbach et al. (1987). Custer (1987d) employs an analysis of

 design grammars on pottery and ceramic style zones to postulate an Algonquian migration. His ongoing
 research with Webb Complex materials in Delaware indicates that this population movement may have
 occurred during the Middle to Late Woodland transition in the area, somewhat comparable to FiedePs second
 wave of proto- Algonquian migration (Custer 1987d:21-23; 1988). Studies of early Late Woodland cultures

 in western sections of the Middle Atlantic Region also suggest that population movements may have occurred
 sometime prior to A.D. 700/800 during Middle Woodland times (Stewart 1994a). In these same areas,
 however, our inability to recognize late Middle Woodland cultures cuts short any lengthy speculation.

 The correlation of archaeological and linguistic data is not very satisfying and opinions on its validity
 have fluctuated dramatically (e.g., Gardner 1982a: 19, 67). These reactions are due in part to theoretical issues
 and to the patchy nature of Middle Woodland studies beyond the Coastal Plain and eastern Piedmont. It is

 tantalizing to note the possible relationship between the timing of the latest of the proposed migrations, the
 horizon-like occurrence of shell-tempered and net-impressed pottery, and the seemingly rigid cultural

 boundary represented by the fall line throughout much of the Middle Atlantic Region. The issue of whether

 or not migrations occurred, and the timing of such movements is far from resolved. What we must accept
 and build on is the fact that there are definite discontinuities in regional languages that can be roughly
 dated and that require explanation using archaeological data.

 LATE WOODLAND: CIRCA A.D. 800/900 TO EUROPEAN CONTACT

 General characterizations of the Late Woodland refer to very settled, farming-oriented cultures using

 maize and other cultigens. However, while sedentism seems to typify the nature of most settlements in the

 region, the role that cultigens play in cultural adaptations varies both through time and across space. Recent

 radiocarbon dates suggest that some farming communities may appear as early as A.D. 700/800 in sections

 of the Susquehanna Valley (Stewart 1993, 1994a). This broadens the scope of what can be, or has been,

 considered as Late Woodland. The earliest physical evidence of maize appears most consistently between
 A.D. 900 and 1000. Even where preserved maize or other cultigens are not found, shifts in the location of

 settlements to broad arable tracts of floodplain are interpreted as a sign of early farming. There is a noticeable
 increase in dated occurrences of maize circa A.D. 1200/1300 and later. There are coastal areas, however, where

 farming seems to have never been important (Figure 10).

 In a recent volume of this journal (Stewart 1993), I have provided a synthesis of regional Late Woodland

 developments, building on the efforts of a variety or researchers. The reader is referred to this paper for more

 detailed discussions and references to the literature. I abstract from that and other work in the summary that

 follows. The Late Woodland is perhaps the single best documented segment of Woodland prehistory, and

 the literature pertaining to it is massive. A variety of frameworks exist for dividing the time into coherent
 units (cf. Custer 1984a, 1986b; Gardner 1982c, 1986; Kraft 1986). A roughly bipartite scheme makes it easier

 to generalize across the region without losing an appreciation of internal developments.

 1 94 Archaeology of Eastern North America

 Populations are organized in hamlets and/or villages during the initial stages of the Late Woodland period.

 For most of the Middle Atlantic Region this entails the time prior to A.D. 1200/1300. In the Upper Potomac

 and northern Shenandoah valleys, it is the time before A.D. 1300/1400. Hamlet-like settlements are evident
 on the Delmarva Peninsula, and in the Lower Delaware Valley where cultigens do not appear to play a role

 in subsistence strategies. Regardless of the specific subsistence system, by the Late Woodland period all
 groups were operating from a sedentary base within a relatively small territory, or at least a territory
 demonstrably smaller than in previous times. Throughout much of Delaware and southern New Jersey,

 productive and predictable estuarine resources were capable of supporting sedentary populations without the

 need for agriculture (see Figure 10). To the south in similarly rich coastal areas, maize and farming-oriented

 settlements aren't pervasive until sometime after A.D. 1300/1400.

 There are clear differences in the degree of social complexity exhibited by prehistoric cultures during
 the first half of the Late Woodland period. Mound and cairn burials in portions of the Susquehanna and

 Potomac drainages distinguish the cultures of these areas from the remainder of the region (Gardner 1986:77-

 92; MacCord 1 986; Stewart 1981,1 994a). These mound-building cultures are not continuous with those found

 in the same area during the first half of the Middle Woodland. Analogies for the social systems linked with
 the mound builders have been drawn with "big man" types of societies and tribal organizations (Gardner
 1986:85; Hay et al. 1987:60-62; Stewart 1994a:29-31). There are no appreciable differences in the intensity

 with which agricultural products seem to be used from drainage to drainage; as yet, social complexity cannot

 be equated confidently with productive intensification and the organization of work. While agriculture may

 be spread as part of a "package" involving plant technology and certain ideologies, its acceptance by groups
 of varying social complexity implies that it was viewed by Native peoples as a solution to some common
 economic problems.

 As Custer (1986c: 161) notes, since maize was not developed within the Middle Atlantic Region, its

 presence throughout the region at basically the same time during the Late Woodland period implies extensive
 outside interactions. In particular, the interaction of Middle Atlantic peoples with groups to the north in

 Iroquoia, and to the south and west in the Ohio Valley, is viewed as a major stimulus in the adoption of

 agriculture and the development of social complexity. The great similarity in material culture and adaptations

 throughout the Appalachian Highlands prior to A.D. 1300 is evidence of the intensity of these interactions.

 Between A.D. 1300 and 1400, a number of cultural changes are evident that persist until historic times

 or disruptions linked to the Susquehannock migration through the northern and central portions of the region

 during the sixteenth century. Populations are nucleating throughout much of the region, settlements are larger
 and more planned in nature, and the occurrence of stockaded villages in many areas implies inter-group

 hostilities. Nucleation appears to occur even in portions of the region where settlements are not fortified, such
 as coastal zones of the Potomac Valley (Potter 1982). Also, a number of authors have presented evidence

 for population movements and population displacement at this time (for example see Clark 1980; Gardner
 1986:79-80; Graybill 1989; MacCord 1984). The effects of the Little Ice Age on climate and environment
 may have altered the productivity of agriculture in some western portions of the region where the growing
 season was short under normal conditions.

 The basic assumption made by most researchers is that population growth during early segments of the

 Late Woodland period result in the fissioning of settlements (hamlets/villages), and the expansion of new

 groups into previously unoccupied areas. Through time population densities reach the point where further

 fissioning and expansion of populations and settlements are not possible. Evidence of increasing population
 densities is seen in the location of sedentary settlements in more peripheral environments not inhabited by

 groups earlier in the period. But these data have not been quantified; site densities cannot be objectively
 compared between the drainages of the region.

 Nucleation into planned villages, intensification of subsistence production, concomitant elaborations

 in social organization, and ultimately, inter-group conflict are the presumed results in this generalized scenario

 of Late Woodland cultural change (see for example Gardner 1986:71-92; Graybill 1992; Hatch 1980:325-326).
 Small population movements, in part possibly stimulated by shortfalls in agricultural productivity as a
 result of the Little Ice Age, would have been another source of potential hostility between communities, and
 a reason for the nucleation of groups (Güster 1986c).

 The time between A.D. 1300/1400 seems to be critical throughout the Eastern Woodlands, as was
 dramatically summarized in a series of papers presented at the 1992 Society for American Archaeology
 meetings (Hart 1992). Population pressure, environmental stress, and socio-political relations were shown

 to be influential in transforming Late Woodland societies over a vast area. The significant point is that not
 all of these factors were operative on all of the cultures in the Eastern Woodlands; effects of the Little Ice

 Age had a dramatic effect on the functioning of agricultural societies in some northern and western sections
 of the Eastern Woodlands, while population densities are seen as influential in other areas. Each of these

 changes to individual cultures, however, had a domino effect on neighboring peoples. Abandonment of areas

 where the growing season was insufficient to support maize agriculture forced some groups into new areas

 and into new and different contacts with other peoples. In turn, these new socio-political relationships
 reverberated through adjacent groups where previously environment, adaptation, and society had been

 functioning on a relatively stable level. In short, the cultural landscape has filled to the point where changes

 in one part of the Late Woodland "world system" influenced other components or members of the system.
 Late Woodland cultural changes in the Middle Atlantic Region must be studied and understood at different
 scales - local, regional, and the "world."

 Defensive settlements, population nucleation, growth and/or reorganization of settlements, and population

 movements or displacement are noticeably lacking in the Delaware Valley (but see Custer 1987d). What

 accounts for the cultural conservatism seen in the Delaware Valley through the Late Woodland period? Why

 don't we see the gradual population growth and expansion that is an outgrowth of small, agricultural
 communities in other areas of the region?

 Differences in the environmental potentials between drainage basins in the region are clearly not at the
 root of the matter; all include relatively productive coastal zones and interior riverine areas possess
 considerable acreage suitable for farming. Explanations for these differences may relate to the nature of social

 organization at the time that agricultural communities get started. In much of the Susquehanna and Potomac
 basins, the society of the earliest farming cultures is already elaborated beyond that seen in the Delaware

 Valley, judging from the occurrence of mound burials and attendant ceremony and the probable economic

 and social linkage of multiple communities. If we assume that the initial social complexity seen in these areas

 drives the organization of work and productive intensification, which in turn leads to population growth and
 expansion, this might shed light on the slower rate of social and community development in the Delaware

 basin. Equally significant may be the relationship between cultures of the Delaware Valley with Owasco and
 proto-Iroquois peoples to the north. Since the environment or distribution of natural resources does not seem

 to be a limiting factor in either case, more socially or politically grounded explanations must be sought for
 the observed patterning.

 The Late Woodland archaeology of Virginia has become especially intriguing in the past decade.
 Numerous settlements, some stockaded, with house patterns have been identified (Turner 1992). The potential
 of these data for examining variability in social organization has yet to be fully realized but leaves open
 exciting possibilities for the future. In addition, a number of new ossuaries and cemeteries have been identified

 (Turner 1992:1 18-120). These data are especially significant since a chiefdom level society is in place at the

 dawn of European contact in the area (Turner 1986, 1992). Virginia has become the laboratory to explore
 the archaeological fingerprint of complex society in the region.

 Most assume that the presence of triangular projectiles in Late Woodland assemblages implies the

 existence of the bow and arrow. If this assumption is accepted, then there may have been attendant changes
 in hunting practices, i.e., greater mobility on the part of the hunter and possible shifts in the status accorded

 hunters and the craft specialists responsible for the creation of weaponry (for example see Seeman 1984:10-

 17). As a weapon, the bow functions more efficiently in a wider variety of situations than the spearthrower,

 which is most useful in close-range ambush situations (Blitz 1988). If it is assumed that a certain degree of

 status was attributed to the hunter skillful with a spear and spearthrower, then the introduction of the bow

 could have served to make better hunters of a larger number of people; the social status of the hunter may

 have diminished from its pre-bow level.

 The role that the bow and arrow may have had in technological changes of early Late Woodland times

 is difficult to access. The stone portion of the projectile is easily made on a flake, but nonetheless needs to

 be of a certain morphology and weight to function effectively in conjunction with an arrow shaft (see Blitz

 1988 for review). On the basis of ethnohistoric data, the production of the arrow shaft and the bow itself seems

 to have been accorded more importance and was the work of specialists (Seeman 1984).

 Late Woodland tool production is firmly grounded in a core and flake technology. Bifaces persist in

 tool kits to some degree, but they are typically made on flakes derived from cores, not from progressively
 reduced chunks or bifacial blanks or stages. The technological shift from Middle to Late Woodland times

 could represent a change in who is making tools within aboriginal society. A core and flake technology would

 have been more accessible to a broader segment of the adult population. The re-emphasis on cryptocrystalline
 lithic material during the Late Woodland, in contrast to the more catholic preferences of Middle Woodland
 times, may relate to this shift in stone tool production. The lack of appreciable trade in chipped stone
 projectiles during Late Woodland times (Stewart 1989:63-65) is perhaps an additional reflection of the decline

 in the importance of the knapper.

 The decline in the exchange of archaeologically visible items during the Late Woodland period is puzzling

 considering the social functions of trade and the conditions that originally fostered regional networks (Stewart

 1989).It is possible that through time, perishable goods are used more frequently in transactions and these
 are simply not well preserved in archaeological deposits. It is also possible that trade relations were left

 increasingly in the hands of real or putative heads of kin groups or communities, and that exchanges involved
 fewer, but more symbolically powerful items (cf. Hall 1977; Kuhn 1987:306). However, the southern half

 of the region stands out as an area where marine shell and copper are mainstays of an exchange network once
 dominated by items made from stone (Stewart 1989:65).

 FINALE

 Over the past 10-15 years, we have benefitted from not only new data, but also from looking at the same

 old data in different ways. Some of the statements that we are now making about Woodland cultures have

 been made earlier, and represented very creative and inspired thinking based on a minimal amount of data.

 Now we can say that some of these ideas have been fleshed-out and the original statements can be made with
 more confidence. This shouldn't be construed as not having learned anything since the "good old days." It

 is simply thè nature of science. The data base has reached the point where what we conclude about prehistory

 is becoming less like a "just-so" story and more like the evening news.

 Specific recommendations for further research would occupy the entirety of another presentation. In

 brief, more "stock-taking" and re-synthesizing are needed, and will always be needed. It would be helpful

 if state and federal agencies, universities, and CRM firms complied a list, on an annual basis, that summarizes

 the contributions of the investigations that they have sponsored. This literally could be something as simple

 as a list organized by subject, geographic area, or temporal period, or an annotated bibliography. A number

 of states (e.g., Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia) issue annotated bibliographies on a somewhat periodic basis.
 But the wheat still needs to be separated from the chaff.
