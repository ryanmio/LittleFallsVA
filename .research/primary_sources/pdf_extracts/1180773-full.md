 NCE IN A WHILE someone slows down

 there was little more to see than small dark stains in

 to read the historical marker that the state

 put up alongside the county road years
 before the site was actually found. Now the loca-
 tion is known for certain, but no one bothers to

 move the sign, because seventeenth-century Mid-
 dle Plantation-down a side road and halfway
 across a soybean field in the rolling farm country
 west of Annapolis, Maryland-is nothing to look at
 anyway. Even when the excavation was in progress,

 the mottled subsoil, the center of each pierced by a
 tobacco stick. The farmer who plowed the field had
 used the sticks to mark the stains that piqued his
 curiosity as they flashed by under the share. His
 own transformation into an excavator soon after-

 ward followed almost literally the proverbial advice
 given to aspiring archaeologists: Get a bag of mar-
 bles and start collecting artifacts; every time you
 find one, replace it with a marble; when you have
 lost all your marbles, an archaeologist you will be.
 When the Maryland farmer had used up all his
 tobacco sticks, there were those who said he had to

 be a little daffy to see in their crazy pattern the
 houses, quarters, barns, and fence rows of a plan-
 tation that once belonged to one of Maryland's
 wealthiest and most successful merchant-planters.
 To be told that the seventeenth-century civili-
 zation of England's largest and most populous
 American dominion, the Chesapeake colonies of
 Virginia and Maryland, has vanished almost with-
 out trace above ground, challenges credulity. Yet,
 that reality, stranger than fiction, is the inescapable
 testament of an impressive body of evidence re-
 cently accumulated in excavations on sites south
 from Middle Plantation to southern Maryland, to
 the northern neck of Virginia, and all along the
 York and James rivers. Its veracity is further borne
 out by the work of architectural historians, now in
 league with dendrochronologists. By careful
 examination of standing structures in the region
 they have reduced the probable number of sur-
 viving seventeenth-century buildings to fewer than
 six. So completely has time effaced the physical
 remains of early Chesapeake society that scholars
 have not bothered to look for catastrophes. Instead
 they believe that root causes can only be found in
 understanding the nature of material life in the
 New World, the pragmatic choices that faced all
 seventeenth-century settlers and homesteaders,

 extraordinary renascence of scholarly interest in
 seventeenth-century Chesapeake history, an event
 that has received considerable notice in historical

 circles.1 Less publicized, although not less remark-
 able, are the parallel efforts and comparable
 achievements of historians' opposite numbers in
 the fieldworking disciplines of archaeology and ar-
 chitectural history. Until ten years ago, the Na-
 tional Park Service had opened almost the only
 peephole on the material world of seventeenth-
 century Virginia by its excavation of Jamestown in
 the 195os.2 Since then, a few individuals and four
 major research institutions-St. Mary's City Com-
 mission (Maryland), Virginia Research Center for
 Archaeology (Williamsburg), Colonial Wil-
 liamsburg, and Department of Anthropology,
 College of William and Mary (for a time affiliated
 with Southside Foundation)-have systematically
 explored over twenty-five sites in tidewater
 Maryland and Virginia (fig. i). The structures
 brought to light have been almost without excep-
 tion buildings whose framing members were in one
 manner or another "earthfast," that is, standing or
 lying directly on the ground or erected in post-
 holes.3 While a few such impermanent structures

 ginia (Washington, D.C.: National Park Service, 1958); John L.

 ginia] (Yorktown: Colonial National Historical Park, 1955); Ivor

 Noel Hume, "Mathews Manor," Antiques 40, no. 6 (December
 1966): 832-36. The hole-set buildings discovered on the
 Mathews Manor site are described here for the first time (Ap-
 pendix 2:24). The masonry foundations of several presumed
 seventeenth-century structures encountered in the restoration
 of Colonial Williamsburg have never been reported on. Sites
 described in Henry Chandlee Forman,Jamestown and St. Mary's,
 Buried Cities of Romance (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1938),
 have mostly been reexcavated and reinterpreted by National
 Park Service and St. Mary's City Commission.

 3 The general term earthfast refers throughout this essay to
 timbers embedded in the ground any way at all; hole-set and the
 contemporary phrase "posts in the ground" specifically denote
 uprights erected in postholes; ground-standing, ground-laid, and
 trench-laid are modern terms for members set directly on the
 ground surface or embedded in trenches too shallow to give the
 structure rigidity. Other building terms used in this essay are
 described in figure 3.

 The first purpose of this article, therefore, is to

 reintroduce the vernacular architecture of
 seventeenth-century Virginia and Maryland. We
 have thought it best to present prime examples of
 the principal building types in ten brief site reports
 (Appendix 1) because, frankly, the evidence is
 open to more than one interpretation, and we
 think others ought to have a chance to draw their
 own conclusions. We expound our own in the ini-
 tial discussion section of this essay. There and in an
 inventory of archaeological sites presented in Ap-
 pendix 2 we have also tried to make some account
 of the more than 150 earthfast buildings about
 which something is now known. For the first time,
 American historical archaeologists have in hand a
 body of evidence sufficiently large to support valid
 general observations comparable to those that
 numerous surviving buildings make possible in
 New England. Yet, comparisons have been slow in
 coming, partly because most of the new informa-
 tion is hidden away in unpublished reports. Ap-
 pendix 2 is no substitute for fuller publication, nor
 are scholars relieved of the obligation to read site
 reports. But, being comprehensive, the inventory
 makes possible some preliminary comparative
 analyses as well as indicating where additional in-
 formation may be found.

 If American readers make their first acquain-

 tance with earthfast buildings in these pages, En-
 glish archaeologists will study them for another
 reason. Impermanent buildings are nothing un-
 usual on Anglo-Saxon and medieval sites.4 They
 have been found in regions where peasant houses
 were built of earth and stone and, now that de-
 serted medieval village sites are being explored in
 central England, in areas where timber building
 has an ancient ancestry.5 Early results suggest a

 of historic structures in their respective states. That
 fieldwork led to the identification of the earliest
 buildings in the region. Those in Maryland, St.
 Mary's City Commission and Maryland Historical
 Trust made the object of a special recording proj-
 ect for the Historic American Buildings Survey.8
 Recently some of the oldest buildings have been
 revisited and sampled by the American Institute of
 Dendrochronology in a successful attempt to date
 construction and subsequent alterations.9 All this
 research had two important consequences. By
 isolating the earliest extant structures attention was
 focused on the building conventions that distin-
 guished what contemporaries in the seventeenth
 century called the "Virginia house." Once those
 traits were recognized, connections could be traced
 back to specific regional traditions in English ver-
 nacular architecture.10 Thus, the links were
 formed with archaic, timber building practices in
 England that finally led to the realization that col-
 onists had known a whole range of building
 types-from the earthfast to the "fayre framed"-
 from which long experience had already accus-
 tomed them to choose whichever best suited the
 circumstances they encountered.

 But now from England's former American col-
 onies comes complicating evidence to suggest that
 Englishmen kept alive certain very ancient and
 primitive building traditions well into the modern
 age. There is no question that the earthfast struc-
 tures excavated along the eastern seaboard repre-
 sent contemporary English practice transplanted
 to an American setting and are not New World
 inventions. The construction techniques described
 in this essay appear full blown on sites occupied as
 early as 1618-19, scarcely ten years after the set-
 tlement of Jamestown. Thereafter they are en-
 countered so consistently and widely throughout
 the Chesapeake area, and are known (mostly from
 literary sources) from as far away as New England,
 that independent invention must be ruled out as a
 plausible explanation. There has to have been a
 common source, and that source can only have
 been the colonists' homeland, England. English
 scholars, therefore, need to reassess their chronol-

 ogy and look again at fragmentary evidence from
 central Lincolnshire, south Somerset, Yorkshire,
 and elsewhere that hints at a coexistence of vigor-
 ous permanent and impermanent vernacular
 building traditions lasting possibly into the early
 nineteenth century.7

 It is an easy step from matters such as these,

 Discussion

 family. On the other hand, as the early history of
 the Chesapeake gives ample proof, financial re-
 verses and other unforeseen setbacks postponed
 improvements and stalled farm economies in a
 perpetual state of incipient development. Such
 considerations figured so concretely in prospective
 settlers' perceptions of the opportunities that
 awaited them in the American colonies that, before

 setting out, many calculated the costs of different
 construction techniques down to the last
 halfpenny. "Tooling up" a plantation is a vital di-
 mension to two questions that have come to domi-
 nate recent research in Chesapeake history, that is,
 to what degree the Tobacco Coast was a land of
 opportunity for small growers before 166o and
 how did those who survived and acquired land and
 labor manage their resources. The subject leads
 from there to two other favorite topics, the gradual
 growth of a stable social order and the rise of a
 genuine consumer culture after 1700.

 To interpret correctly the buildings that ar-
 chaeologists are now bringing to light one must
 start by making a distinction. These were not the
 makeshift shelters that sprang up in every new col-
 ony in the first days, weeks, and months following
 an expedition's landfall. Nor were they the im-
 provised dwellings that later arrivals slapped to-
 gether to huddle in while they cleared land for new
 farms or plantations. The early chronicles of
 almost every colony from Massachusetts Bay to the
 Carolinas clutter the landscape with shantytowns
 of huts, hovels, tents, cabins, caves, and dugouts.12
 Describing an aboriginal house form that a hand-
 ful of iron nails transformed into an "English wig-
 wam," one writer explained that such dwellings
 were the sort built for ten shillings "in the first 15.
 days whilst the ship at anchor is unlading and
 bound to diet and lodge the passenger."13 Pun-
 cheon and hole-set buildings not only do not fit the
 descriptions of these earliest windbreaks, but ar-
 chaeologists are now proving that such buildings
 lasted longer than the usual life span of wigwams
 and dugouts, which contemporaries reckoned at a
 few months to three or four years at most.14
 Clearly, impermanence was a matter of degree.

 The special fascination that primitive shelters
 held for an earlier generation of American ar-
 chitectural historians seems disproportionate today
 to their real importance.15 For those who built
 them they were temporary, improvised expe-
 dients; for us such improvisations are as remote to
 a study of regional vernacular building traditions

 12 These are conveniently collected in S. Fiske Kimball,

 Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies and of the Early Re-
 public (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1922), pp. 3-9, and
 recently for Massachusetts in Abbott Lowell Cummings, The
 Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay, 1625-I725 (Cambridge,
 Mass., and London: Harvard University Press, Belknap Press,
 1979), PP. 18-21.

 with their entire families for two, three, or four years" ("In-
 formation Respecting Land in New Netherland," in Penn-

 For once, written-record historians and their
 fieldworking brethren share a common plan of
 work. It is no coincidence. The institution most

 responsible for reviving interest in Chesapeake
 studies, St. Mary's City Commission, deliberately
 set out in 1969 to assemble a staff of archaeologists
 and social historians, and, that thing most rare, put
 them all to work on a single historical problem-to
 explore and to explain the transformation of
 Chesapeake society in the colonial period." Their
 collaborative example has now spread to other in-
 stitutions. As the circle of scholars expands and the
 slow work of archaeology advances, we look for-
 ward to a more regular flow of published site re-
 ports, architectural monographs, and, every now
 and then, our highest hope, an interpretive work
 of history. But for now this essay must serve all.
 Readers with a specialized interest in the physical
 evidence of early buildings are advised to start with
 the abbreviated site reports in Appendix i before
 turning to the discussion of that evidence that fol-
 lows immediately hereafter. Historians and others
 whose patience for postholes and potsherds has
 limits may wish to skim those sections to form only
 a passing acquaintance with the varieties of
 earthfast building and concentrate instead on the
 second half of the essay where we have put im-
 permanent architecture into a historical context
 and there try to assess its social significance.

 " The collaborative character of the commission's research

 was the principal feature of two National Endowment for the
 Humanities grants entitled "Plantation Society in Colonial
 Maryland: A Research Partnership between History and His-
 torical Archaeology," nos. RO-6228-72-468 (1972-74) and
 RO-1o585-74-267 (1974-76).

 nacular architecture in Great Britain and northern
 Europe. Much more important-then and now-
 were the buildings that came immediately after-
 ward, for, although often "very meane and Little,"
 they were, as one eyewitness observed, "Generally
 after the manner of . . . farme houses in En-

 gland."16 In other words, these were houses with
 antecedents. They were an architecture re-
 membered from home. Hence, for us they are the

 of the Old.

 and bring home hay, also to build houses and barnes for men
 and cattle. [Emphases added.]

 Van Tienhoven's report starts out seeming to
 imply that the dugouts or "cottages" were resorted
 to mainly by "those in New Netherland and espe-
 cially in New England who have no means to build
 farm-houses." But later it explains that nearly
 everyone built huts the first summer and real
 "houses and barnes for men and cattle" the next.

 Whether they came to farm, to trade, or to fol-
 low some other occupation, immigrants expected
 to make an investment in buildings. House con-
 struction and barn raising were inescapable first
 steps in a process of homesteading that was central
 to the American experience for over 300 years. It
 required the planter-settler-pioneer-sodbuster to
 select from his or his carpenter's repertoire of
 building types and construction methods those best
 suited to immediate circumstances. A few could af-

 ford to gratify at once their ultimate aspiration for
 the best sort of building they had known at home.
 Many more could not or recognized the wisdom of
 choosing an easier, quicker, and cheaper form of
 building to meet their present need. Such was the
 advice that experienced colonists gave to newcom-
 ers. Cornelius Van Tienhoven recommended that

 emigrants from the Low Countries time their de-
 parture so as to reach New Netherland in March or
 April.

 Boors [farmers] and others who are obliged to work at
 first in Colonies ought to sail from this country in the
 fore or latter part of winter in order to arrive with God's
 help in New Netherland early in the Spring in March, or
 at latest in April, so as to be able to plant, during that
 summer, garden vegetables, maize, and beans, and
 moreover employ the whole summer in clearing land and build-
 ing cottages [that is, the dugouts that he describes later].

 All then who arrive in New Netherland must im-

 mediately set about preparing the soil, so as to be able, if
 possible to plant some winter grain, and to proceed the
 next winter to cut and clear the timber . . . [including
 such trees] as are suitable for building, for palisades,
 posts and rails, which must be prepared during the win-
 ter, so as to be set up in the spring on the new made land
 which is intended to be sown, in order that the cattle may
 not in any wise injure the crops [in other words, fences
 first] ....

 The farmer can get all sorts of cattle in the course of

 torical Society, 1883-1919), 5:266.

 [Even] the wealthy and principal men in New England,
 in the beginning of the Colonies, commenced their first
 dwelling-houses in this fashion for two reasons; first, in
 order not to waste time building and not to want food
 the next season; secondly, in order not to discourage
 poorer laboring people whom they brought over in
 numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four

 years, when the country became adapted to agriculture,
 they built themselves handsome houses, spending on
 them several thousands.17

 The "poorer laboring people" presumably had to
 make do with their homestead houses and barns a

 good deal longer than the wealthy.

 For many newcomers a hut was followed, as
 soon as could be, by a weatherproof but cheaply
 built house, which was not expected to last longer
 than it took its owner to accumulate enough capital
 to build yet another more substantial dwelling.
 Over and over again homesteaders on each new
 frontier moved in the same three steps from
 primitive shelters to temporary, impermanent
 buildings, to the "fayre houses" that many yeomen
 and even husbandmen were used to from England.
 "If any one designs to make a Plantation in this
 Province," Thomas Nairne wrote from South
 Carolina in 1710, "the first thing to be done is,
 after having cutt down a few Trees, to split Palis-
 sades or Clapboards and therewith make small
 Houses or Huts to shelter the slaves."1s In an area

 where neighbors had already moved on to the sec-
 ond or third stage of homesteading, only blacks
 needed to endure the worst hardships of getting
 started. The planter, his overseer, and his white
 indentured servants could expect to board "with-
 out any Charges" at nearby plantations. "And if the
 Person have any Wife or Children, they are com-
 monly left in some Friend's House till a suitable
 dwelling Place and Conveniences are provided, fit
 for them to live decently." Decency and a modicum

 Time to begin a settlement is in September or, at fartherest,
 before the first of December."

 of convenience-these were all a newcomer should

 look forward to in the first few years. But Nairne
 reported that most settlers had hopes for a larger,
 better house in the future. A family's "small
 House," he said, "usually serves for a Kitchen af-
 terwards when they are in better Circumstances."'19
 One, two, three-hovel, house, home. In set-
 tlement after settlement that was the beau ideal,
 not for everyone, of course, and not invariably
 even for those so minded. Frontier communities

 often resembled the description of one in central
 North Carolina where the first inhabitants "built

 and lived in log Cabbins, and as they became more
 wealthy, some of them built framed clapboard
 houses with clay chimneys." Those were the years
 before 18oo. "At present," said the writer in 181 o,
 "there are many good houses, well constructed
 with brick chimneys, and glass lights. [Yet] there
 are no stone or brick walled houses, nor any that
 can be called edifices. . . . The greatest number of
 citizens yet build in the old stile." The standard was
 often easier to imagine than to meet.20

 Can we be sure that for temporary houses

 homesteaders used inferior materials and methods

 of construction that were significantly cheaper,
 quicker, and consequently less durable than those
 employed in later permanent dwellings? Can we
 justifiably equate the various kinds of perishable
 structures described in the site reports presented
 in Appendix 1 with an interim stage in the ideal
 homesteading process? In several specific cases the
 answer is unequivocally yes. Applied more gener-
 ally the correlation still holds true, but with the
 important caveat that some earthfast building
 techniques passed into a mainstream tradition
 among southern housewrights by the close of the
 seventeenth century. The circumstances that pro-
 longed their use to the point that they became an
 acceptable alternative to full frame construction
 are discussed in the concluding section of this
 paper. For the moment it is enough to show that
 many colonists, just starting out, regarded
 earthfast buildings as adequate for their immediate
 purposes, but inferior to those they expected to
 construct later.

 John Lewger, we know positively, built his
 house, St. John's, at St. Mary's City (fig. 2; Appen-
 dix 1:8) four years after Maryland was founded
 and within half a mile of the original bivouac
 where the colonists took shelter in abandoned In-

 dian wigwams. Similarly George Yeardley's party
 was accommodated at the main encampment on
 Jamestown Island before pushing on upriver to
 Flowerdew Hundred. Jamestown likewise served
 as the base camp for the founders of
 Wolstenholmtown, seven miles downstream. The
 archaeological evidence makes clear that few
 structures in any of these early settlements were
 primitive lean-tos, but neither were they "orderly,
 fair and well built" houses. The Flowerdew build-

 ings (Appendix 1:5, 6) lasted scarcely twenty-five
 years, although the town survived into the next
 century. The dwellings and storehouses destroyed
 at Wolstenholmtown in 1622 (Appendix 2:18)
 were followed by farmsteads comprised entirely of
 hole-set barns and farmhouses, which in their turn

 lasted only another twenty years or so (Appendix
 2:19). Nearby on Littletown Quarter, Kingsmill,
 two dwellings-a tiny puncheon cabin and its
 hole-set frame successor-were built, used, and
 abandoned, all before 1650 (Appendix 1:1). St.
 John's was longer lived, partly because it was better
 built to begin with, but mainly because its under-
 pinnings were renewed periodically and its ac-
 commodations enlarged and modernized. Like
 other buildings its dominant trait was its tran-
 sience.

 Written records multiply the small but growing
 archaeological sample of impermanent buildings
 associated with immigrants who were just getting
 settled. They also make explicit the inferences
 drawn from archaeological evidence. An anony-
 mous pamphlet, published in 1684 to promote the
 new colony of Pennsylvania, gave "Such Persons as
 are Inclined to America" a virtual set of blueprints
 and a bill of particulars for "a mean way of Build-
 ing," but one that "ordinary beginners" would find
 "sufficient and safest." It called for a medium-sized

 house, 30 feet long and 18 feet wide, with one par-
 tition near the middle and another to divide one
 end into two smaller rooms (fig. 3). "These
 houses," prospective settlers were assured, "usually
 endure ten years without Repair." It is easy to
 understand why not longer.

 "1 This was true of a small log cabin that Charles Yates in-
 structed an agent to build on his lot in newly laid out Bath
 Town, Berkeley County, Virginia, in 1778: the cabin "may in
 future be turned into a Kitchen [consequently] it should be so
 placed on the Lott as to be convenient to a Better House which
 will stand on the best front in the Lott" (Charles Yates Letter
 Book, 1773-83, folio 2oo-1, Alderman Library, University of
 Virginia, Charlottesville).

 which are mentioned, may have been fastened to
 interrupted sills, which, although not referred to,
 may have been included among the "several other
 small pieces" that house builders were to salvage
 from leftover odds and ends. On the other hand,
 the interrupted sills used at Cedar Park (fig. 4) are
 heftier than that. It is perhaps more likely that the
 pamphleteer was remembering houses in which
 the studs, too, were buried in holes or trenches or
 were fastened to unframed lengths of sill beam laid
 in slots in the ground. Examples of both have been

 certainly learned from Chesapeake settlements
 immediately to the south. The construction tech-
 niques he described, in particular the so-called
 "false Plates" and the common-rafter roof, came
 straight out of a distinctive regional building tradi-
 tion in Maryland and Virginia that had already de-
 veloped away from English prototypes by the third
 quarter of the seventeenth century.22 Here then,
 Pennsylvania notwithstanding, are the specifica-
 tions for a southern planter's house, modest
 enough, the pamphlet tells us, for a newcomer to
 build within twelve months after his arrival, yet
 sufficiently substantial to last ten years. Afterward,
 if he prospered, the worn-out "first House" could
 be used, as the Carolina homestead was, for "a
 good out House till plenty will allow ... a Better."
 As with all promotional literature, the descrip-
 tion repays careful reading between the lines. Its
 list of parts is informative not only for what it in-
 cludes but also for what is left out, the chief omis-
 sions being chimneys and ground sills. Although
 the writer explained that such houses were to
 "stand upon" the four pairs of i6-inch posts that

 omission of ground-level floor joists from the list.
 Although the excavation of St. John's has shown
 that sleepers could be installed independently of
 any ground sills that a building may or may not
 have had, here there was no need. "The lower
 flour," the pamphleteer explained, "is the Ground;
 the upper Clabbord."23 Probably many im-
 permanent buildings had only earthen floors.
 Floors laid with expensive sawn planks were one
 feature, along with glazed windows and white-
 limed walls, that John Hammond associated with
 the somewhat better built farmhouses he saw in
 Virginia in 1656.24 Their absence elsewhere no
 doubt contributed to the "meanness" of poorer
 homesteaders' houses.

 discomforts of settling in an overseas colony. All,
 no matter what their circumstances, were be-
 ginners. Take, for instance, a man like James
 Claypoole of Pennsylvania, whose letters describe
 step by step the process of planning, building, and
 improving a temporary house.25 Claypoole was a
 merchant, a stockholder in William Penn's Free
 Society of Traders, and an owner of some five
 thousand acres of province lands. Wealthy as he
 was, he knew better than to lavish precious time
 and energy on a substantial first residence. He

 Claypoole cut short a letter to his brother "for cold,
 haveing no Chimney."26 A flued cooking fire was
 more important, so, as the first improvement to his
 dwelling, Claypoole was building a 2o-foot kitchen
 provided with "a double Chimny." His neighbors,
 too, were busy bringing their properties up to
 standard; he wrote that "Wm Framton is on the

 other side of me building a great brewhouse." As
 adequate as Claypoole's house was to "hold us and
 our goods and keep us from the sunn and
 weather," it was a temporary expedient and noth-
 ing more. Even before leaving England he was
 making plans to build a brick house in the spring.
 He instructed his indentured bricklayer to find a
 good clay pit and "prepare as much clay as he can
 in the most convenient place to work upon come
 Springe." He himself would bring another car-
 penter, and he had asked his brother in Barbados
 to send "one or 2 good stout negroes" to help build
 the permanent house, which a man of his means
 could expect to occupy within less than a year after
 his arrival, although not without camping out in a
 barnlike stopgap in the meantime.27

 Claypoole's letters offer only these few clues
 from which to guess what was slighted in making
 his "slight house." Fifty years earlier a New En-
 glander of comparable social standing, Samuel
 Symonds, left much less to the discretion of the
 agent who supervised construction of his house in
 the frontier settlement of Ipswich, Massachusetts.

 26 Houses without chimneys figure in accounts of other
 fledgling colonies. In Massachusetts, for example, a small house
 "made all of clapboards," one of the first in the settlement of
 Watertown, burned down in 1632 "by making a fire in it when it
 had no chimney" (James Savage, ed., The History of New England
 from 163o to 1649, by John Winthrop, Esq ..., 2 vols. [Boston,
 1853], 1:104).

 27 Two-story frame houses built in 1691 on Front Street in
 Philadelphia "were founded under ground on a layer of sap
 clapboards," which were still "hard and sound" when the houses
 were razed about 1810 (John Fanning Watson, Annals of
 Philadelphia [Philadelphia: E. L. Carey & A. Hart; New York:
 G. & H. C. Carvill; 1830], p. 290).

 sparrs reach downe pretty deep at the eves to preserve
 the walls the better from the wether, I would have it
 sellered all over, & soe the frame of the howse accord-

 engly from the bottom. I would have the howse stronge
 in timber, though plaine & well brased. I would have it
 covered with very good oake-hart inch board, for the
 present, to be tacked on onely for the present, as you
 tould me. Let the frame begin from the bottom of the
 seller, & soe in the ordinary way upright, for I can
 hereafter (to save the timber within grounde) run up a
 thin brickwork without. I thinke it best to have the walls

 without to be all clapboarded besides the clay walls. It
 were not amisse to leave a dore-way or two within the
 seller, that soe hereafter one may make comings in from
 without, & let them be both upon that side which the
 lucome window or windowes be.28

 Four features of the Symonds house are un-

 common or unknown among surviving
 seventeenth-century buildings for precisely the
 reasons that recommended their use in circum-
 stances where time and costs had to be held to a

 minimum. The pair of clay-daubed timber chim-

 that the letter in the collections of the Essex Institute, Salem,
 Massachusetts, was written after Symonds's arrival in Mas-
 sachusetts.

 required no mortises, which, being time-
 consuming, were costly. Clamps worked well where
 the floor above supported ordinary loads. But
 Symonds planned to store corn and other un-
 usually heavy goods upstairs and, therefore,
 cautioned that the side bearers "must not be

 neys, one on each gable, must have resembled the
 "double clayed chimney" built in 1638 for the
 minister at the Agawam trading post (now
 Springfield, Massachusetts).29 References to posted
 "Welsh chimneys" occur frequently enough in the
 seventeenth-century records of Maryland and Vir-
 ginia to imply that wooden chimneys like
 Symonds's were used in insubstantial dwellings
 throughout the colonies.30 Hole-set timber chim-
 neys are regularly encountered on excavated sites
 (for example, Utopia Leasehold, Appendix 1:4),
 and one, River Creek in York County, Virginia
 (Appendix 2:23), has produced unmistakable evi-
 dence of a chimney raised on corner posts with
 hole-set studs in between.

 pinned on, but rather eyther lett in to the studds
 [in notches] or borne up with false studds, and soe
 tenented in at the ends." What he meant by false
 studs can only be guessed, perhaps secondary up-
 rights fastened to the backs of the regular studs
 and snugged up under the clamps to bear their
 weight. As for tenoning the clamps "in at the
 ends," possibly he had in mind only a simple lap
 joint at their juncture with the posts. Otherwise, it
 is hard to understand how reinforced side bearers

 Symonds wanted the frame of his two-story
 house to be "strong in timber," yet, even so, it was
 to stand on posts set on or into the cellar floor. As
 his letter specifies, "Let the frame begin from the
 bottom of the seller, and soe in the ordinary way
 upright." It was ordinary for homestead structures
 perhaps but certainly not ordinary at all for the
 sorts of seventeenth-century houses that have
 lasted to the present day in New England.
 Symonds himself understood the difference, which
 he explained by saying, "I think to make it a girt
 house will make it more chargeable then neede."
 Instead of framing the ground-floor ceiling beams
 into girts and they in turn into the wall posts in the
 usual way, he called for "side bearers for the sec-
 ond story," or what we now term clamps. These
 were normally pegged to the inside surface of the
 posts and studs, in effect providing a shelf on
 which to rest the ends of the joists.31 The technique

 29 Samuel Eliot Morison, Builders of the Bay Colony (Boston

 and New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1958), p. 346.

 30 For example, Archives of Maryland, 41:281-82, contains a
 deposition concerning housing built by one Hugh Bevin (obvi-
 ously Welsh himself), whose duties included putting up "the
 Posts of the Welch Chimney." Timber chimneys were some-
 times backed with brick. John Mercer, building a frame house
 in Marlborough, Virginia, in 1730, paid his carpenters for "cov-
 ering my house and building a Chimney" and "plaistering my
 House and making 2 brick backs" (Mercer Ledger B [1725-32],
 Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, Pennsylvania).
 Mercer, an English merchant, took shelter in a small, aban-
 doned house on first moving to Marlborough in 1726, for him
 the equivalent of a hut or a wigwam. Four years later he built a
 frame house with wooden chimneys and sixteen years after that
 a permanent dwelling, a fine brick mansion. See C. Malcolm
 Watkins, The Cultural History of Marlborough, Virginia: An Ar-
 chaeological and Historical Investigation of the Port Town for Stafford
 County and the Plantation of John Mercer (Washington, D.C.:
 Smithsonian Institution Press, 1968), pp. 17-20, 34-39, 85-99.
 31 Clamps, adopted in the second half of the sixteenth cen-
 tury as a method of inserting first floors into older open halls,
 "came to be regarded as a cheap alternative, structurally, by
 both carpenter and customer during the 17th century. The use
 of these obviated the use of girths, the inclusion of which was

 saved much over girts.

 The final expedient was the roof, covered with
 oak boards "tacked on onely for the present." Ap-
 parently Symonds had plans to put on another
 kind of roof when time allowed or materials be-

 came available. Unlike Claypoole, the thrifty New
 Englander was building a house now that he could
 eventually improve to the point of making it more
 or less permanent without putting himself to the
 expense of building entirely anew. Not only was
 there the roof, the chimneys "stronger than ordi-
 nary," and the "draw-windowes" suited to "both
 the present and future use," but, knowing that in-
 evitably the posts would rot, he anticipated that "I
 can hereafter (to save the timber within grounde)
 run up a thin brickwork without," in other words,
 brick foundation walls.32 The same measure pre-
 served another hole-set frame at Cedar Park.

 Symonds's instructions for a make-do house in
 Ipswich, Claypoole's for his barnlike contrivance in
 Philadelphia, and the brochure for prospective
 builders of ordinary beginners' cottages in Penn's
 colony all state explicitly that the dwellings were
 interim structures. They demonstrate that a
 characteristic second stage in the process of mak-
 ing new settlements was often accompanied by the
 several sorts of earthfast structures that ar-

 expensive" (Cecil A. Hewett, "Some East Anglican Prototypes
 for Early Timber Houses in America," Post-Medieval Archaeology
 3 [ 1969]: 1o9). Hewett illustrates two early seventeenth-century
 Essex (England) houses with original clamps in Post-Medieval
 Archaeology 3 (1969): 102-4; 5 (1971): 79-80.

 32 In specifying that the windows were to be smallish and as
 few as possible Symonds was again saving time and money. An
 itemized list of repairs carried out on a house at Snow Hill
 Manor, Maryland, in 1639 shows that "making framed win-
 dows" could be extremely time-consuming, at Snow Hill taking
 more than twice as long as covering the roof (Archives of Mary-
 land, 4:1 to).

 although, if British, he was likely to build a frame
 house covered with clapboards. "Such are almost
 all the English houses in the country," one traveler
 noted, failing only to observe that many (judging
 now from archaeological evidence) were raised on
 earthfast frames.33

 Connecticut,38 in Plymouth,39 and in Charlestown,
 which was merely a trading station before Mas-
 sachusetts Bay was settled in 1630. In that year
 Capt. Roger Clap put into the Charlestown harbor
 and later described the village as having a few
 "wigwams and one House." The house was a
 "palisadoed and thatched" affair built in 1628,
 which, against all odds, was repaired, refurbished,
 and thereby kept standing for 150 years.40 Its
 preservation may have been aided by ground-laid
 sills which provided a dry seat for the palisade
 walls. An early house in Yarmouth, Massachusetts,
 when razed about 1840, revealed wall construction
 of close-set (6-inch) palisades fitted into auger
 holes bored in parallel rows in the sills and plates
 and infilled with a packing of stones and clay.41

 But silled palisade walls were exceptional. Most
 such buildings were puncheon buildings, which to
 housewrights then and to archaeologists since have
 usually meant ephemeral structures raised around
 a gaggle of earthfast uprights. Their builders may
 not even have planned them in the "bay" units so

 surrounded by a stockade (Log Cabin Myth, p. 88n). Sometimes it
 did (see Samuel Maverick, "A Briefe Description of New En-
 gland . . . [ca. 166o]," Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical
 Society, 2d ser. i [1885]: 234-36), but not always. For example, a
 thief broke into a dwelling house in Plymouth, in 1646 "by
 putting aside some loose pallizadoes" (Nathaniel B. Shurtleff
 and David Pulsifer, eds., Records of the Colony of New Plymouth, 12

 [Toronto: Toronto University Press, 1949], pp. 37-42, 53-59,
 61-64). Whether New World builders were merely following a
 very old practice still current in seventeenth-century England
 and France is part of the larger question we hope this essay
 reopens, that is, how extensively ancient methods of im-
 permanent building may have survived into fairly recent times.

 Puncheon buildings. The most primitive were
 buildings with driven posts and in fact not really
 framed at all. Two dwellings excavated at the
 Maine, a 162o-30s plantation site opposite James-
 town (Appendix 2:14), were hardly more than
 cabins, each nailed together around a rectangular
 pen of randomly placed uprights.34 Their fragile
 remains recall a structure of similar size, plan, and
 date found underneath nearby Littletown Quarter
 (Appendix 1:1). All were raised on poles and posts
 whose basal elevations varied so greatly as to rule
 out prefabricated walls or preassembled parts. In-
 deed, the absence of separately discernible post-
 holes and molds suggests that the uprights were
 individually driven into the ground, making them
 what contemporaries knew as "punches," or, when
 set close together, perhaps in prepared trenches,
 "pallisados."35 Puncheon buildings are mentioned
 in accounts of several early and widely separated
 settlements, often in terms that leave no doubt
 about their inferior and temporary character. It
 was reported from Virginia in 1623, for instance,
 that the settlers' houses "are onlie made of wood,
 few or none of them beeing framed houses but
 punches sett into the Ground And couered with
 Boards so as a firebrand is sufficient to consume

 them all."36 Six years after Scituate, Massachusetts,

 Alain Outlaw, Virginia Research Center for Archaeology.

 35 The different terms applied to fence construction too, as
 the case of Gerret van Sweringen of St. Mary's City demon-
 strates. In 1684 his cattle broke into a garden by pushing "be-
 tween the palisadoes" (Archives of Maryland, 17:300-301). When
 excavated, the fence was found to have been constructed of
 closely spaced, heavy riven posts.

 There may have been forms of construction

 familiar to frame construction; occasional
 similarly constructed, are described as early as
 specifications for houses described as being so
 1650.45
 many "lengths of [riven clap-] boards" long,
 "alloweing 5 foote to each length," may betray a
 way of thinking in which the design of buildings
 was dimensioned in multiples of standard clap-
 board sizes rather than units of framing, an ap-
 proach entirely consistent with the piecemeal
 manner of erecting puncheon structures.42 It is
 hard to draw a line between houses like those at the

 that represented a cross between studded hole-set
 buildings and those with puncheon walls. An
 early structure at Flowerdew Hundred, thought to
 be a warehouse, could be one such case (fig. 7;
 Appendix 1:5). It was erected on a bayed
 framework of hole-set posts, but the uncommonly
 wide bays (20 feet), suggest that the smaller,
 earthfast uprights in between gave structural sup-
 port to the wall plates in the manner of puncheons
 rather than of studs.

 Maine and the contraptions that newcomers first
 took shelter in. Indeed, a distinction (other than the
 relative longevity of the Maine houses) is probably
 not worth trying to make. Whether sturdy shacks
 or ramshackle homesteads, they are chiefly inter-
 esting now as the most primitive earthfast struc-
 tures so far discovered, one end of a continuum
 that had at its other end elaborately framed,
 semipermanent, earthfast buildings like Cedar
 Park.

 Hole-set framed buildings. Most houses and barns
 that archaeologists are finding fall somewhere be-
 tween the two extremes; usually they were laid out
 in regular bays formed by paired posts. By paying
 careful attention to the shape, orientation, and
 depth of the postholes and the location of the
 timber molds in those holes, excavators have made

 a start at telling apart hole-set buildings assembled
 in several different ways. The least sophisticated
 were those framed without any ground sills at all,
 not even interrupted sills. A technical drawing
 (1705) of buildings inside an English fort on Casco
 Bay, Maine, illustrates several methods of framing
 and bracing structures that derived most of their
 rigidity from their hole-set posts (fig. 5).43 In
 buildings without sills the studs as well as the posts
 were embedded in the ground. Excavation of
 Kingsmill Tenement I (fig. 6; Appendix 1:2) has
 produced the clearest archaeological evidence of
 this method, one which also left traces in written

 records. The Stafford County, Virginia, court, for
 example, commissioned a small "prison house" in
 1691, specifying "Locust posts Twelve Inches
 Square Studded with Locust Stoods [studs] three
 foot in the ground."44 Houses and farm buildings,

 Project.

 Embedded studs were sometimes improved
 upon when affixed to horizontal timbers laid into
 shallow trenches, a practice akin to the use of sills
 to waterproof the footings of palisade walls. Sites
 on Martin's Hundred along James River, including
 early Wolstenholmtown, have produced the re-
 mains of dwellings, farm buildings, and
 storehouses whose exterior walls stood on trench-

 laid sills interrupted at regular bayed intervals by
 hole-set framing posts (Appendix 2:18). Firmly
 seated in the subsoil, such sill beams were probably
 not tenoned to the posts they abutted, thereby
 saving some costs. But even more important, it was
 a homesteader's willingness to make do with
 earthen floors that resulted in choosing this man-
 ner of construction in preference to interrupted
 sills raised entirely off the ground.

 Higher was drier, and drier was definitely bet-

 ter. Many builders of hole-set structures must have
 agreed that a few more mortises and tenons were
 worth the expense of making interrupted sills an
 integral part of a framed house, for only the major
 uprights have left evidence in the ground on most
 sites. While traces of shallow earthfast studs and

 sills may since have been plowed to nothing, there
 are reasons to suppose that many house frames
 were entirely raised off the ground on hole-set
 posts. Several excavated sites preserve original
 grades, among them the kitchen yards at Gerret
 van Sweringen's tavern (Appendix 2:4), at River
 Creek (Appendix 2:23), and at Yorke Village (Ap-
 pendix 2:20). All yielded evidence of hole-set posts
 but not earthfast studs. Another indication is the
 growing preference among late seventeenth-
 century builders for silled buildings supported on
 wooden blocks (discussed below, p. 153). Such

 land, 41:281-82.

 construction appears to be a more logical out-
 growth of silled frames standing on hole-set posts
 than frames with earthfast studs.

 One of the clearest cases of a house with ele-
 vated sills is also one of the earliest structures exca-

 vated in Virginia. Built about 1620 in the clustered
 settlement on Flowerdew Hundred, its four-bay
 frame was erected on pairs of uprights set up in
 shallow construction trenches, not in separate
 holes (see fig. 7; Appendix 1:6). Blocks of dressed
 siltstone (evidently reused ballast) were placed in
 the trenches between the uprights to make low
 foundation walls, the masons taking care to create
 a level surface. A topping of brickwork brought the
 plinth up evenly underneath what were surely
 interrupted sills; horizontal timbers mortised and
 tenoned to the uprights seated the studs and gave
 rigidity to the ground-standing frame.

 Fully carpentered interrupted sills imply a fair
 degree of precision building. That confirms the
 impression that archaeologists have taken away
 from many excavations: post-in-the-ground
 buildings were often carefully planned, their parts
 prefabricated, and whole units preassembled.
 Raising preassembled frames, whether as walls or
 as tie-beam pairs, required postholes dug to a uni-
 form depth to ensure that all horizontal members
 would come out level. At the John Hallowes site
 (Appendix 2:7) small stone shims were placed at
 the bottoms of some holes to raise the posts
 slightly, while other holes first were excavated to
 the approximate depth desired and then carefully
 scooped out to a measured bottom. Elsewhere it
 has been observed that loose dirt was sometimes

 thrown back into a freshly dug pit and tamped
 down to the correct level.

 Irregular postholes or those with unusually
 small diameters hint that some hole-set buildings
 may have been set up one post at a time, a tech-
 nique described conjecturally in the detailed ac-
 count of Cedar Park (Appendix 1:1io). Where
 frames were assembled in parts on the ground, as
 seems more often to have been the case, and once
 postholes were prepared, prefabricated units were
 tipped up in sections and lowered into place. These
 assembled modules were sometimes the plated side
 walls (resulting in what is known as "normal as-
 sembly") and sometimes post-and-tie-beam pairs
 ("reverse" or "bent assembly"). Each left its own
 telltale marks in the ground, which archaeologists
 are learning to distinguish. Normal assembly of
 side-wall frames was usually aided by positioning
 the rectangular postholes with the long axes at
 right angles to the length of the building (Appen-
 dix 2:6). Their bottoms sometimes were sloped or
 stepped in the direction in which the wall was
 raised, each post coming to rest near the middle or
 far side of the pit at its deepest point. Similarly, it
 stands to reason that house frames raised on pairs
 of posts connected by tie beams were easiest to
 erect where the holes had their long axes parallel
 to the building's length. Kingsmill Tenement II
 (see fig. 6; Appendix 1:2) and the first period
 dwelling at the Clifts (Appendix 2:6) suggest con-
 struction by reverse assembly. The two methods
 may have differed in another subtle respect. Very
 careful measurement of the distances between post
 molds at St. John's Quarter (Appendix 1:8) has re-
 vealed that its bay intervals were calculated origi-
 nally not post to post, but from one outside corner
 to the center of the adjacent post, to the center of the
 one next to it, and so on to the opposite end. The

 carpenter dealt with the entire wall as a single de-
 sign problem, the basic concept underlying all
 normal assembly. Conceivably-and this supposi-
 tion still awaits testing in the field-builders who
 practiced reverse assembly took a bay interval to be
 the space between pairs of posts, that is, the dis-
 tance from the side of one tie-beam pair to the
 nearest side of the next one. That somewhat differ-

 for new building.48 Eventually it prevailed among
 clients too poor to afford brick, thus relegating
 hole-set posts to expendable "pole barns" and
 sheds. Its triumph signals the complete absorp-
 tion of impermanent building practices into the
 dominant timber-frame tradition in the South,
 a matter that will receive fuller discussion later.

 ent way of dimensioning a building may sometimes
 be discernible on archaeological sites and hence
 another important indication of structures raised
 in bent frames.

 Whatever future excavations reveal, the point is
 already well established that post-in-the-ground
 buildings were sometimes so methodically planned
 and precisely dimensioned that their archaeologi-
 cal remains can validate conclusions that turn on
 fractions of an inch. To be sure, such exactitude
 was lacking in many earthfast structures where,
 presumably, costs outweighed advantages. But in
 the hands of master builders post-in-the-ground
 houses could be and sometimes were built as finely
 as the most professionally carpentered box-framed
 structures.

 Framed buildings on hole-set blocks. Some struc-
 tures were fully framed, yet "blocked up under
 the sills," a construction technique especially com-
 mon toward the end of the seventeenth century
 and thereafter. Earthfast blocks left the kind of

 archaeological evidence observed in the excavation
 of an outbuilding on the van Sweringen property
 in St. Mary's City (fig. 8; Appendix 1:9).46
 Like hole-set frames, blocks reduced construction
 costs by compromising a building's durability,
 yet they offered a kind of limited liability. Always
 replaceable, they alone were subject to the decay
 that elsewhere put entire post-in-the-ground build-
 ings at risk. A silled frame standing on structurally
 unrelated blocks was as impervious to damp as a
 framed building raised on brick foundations. What
 evidently began as a method of repairing older
 hole-set structures and rescuing frames built on
 ground-laid sills47 gradually caught on in the
 eighteenth century as a technique equally suitable

 46 A typical reference: When the vestrymen of Truro parish,
 Virginia, undertook to build a new vestry house in 1750, they
 specified a building 16 feet square, including an inside wooden
 chimney, all of "framed work" (that is, box framed), clapboard
 covered, floored with plank, and lofted with more clapboards,
 the entire structure to be "raised on Blocks" (Minutes of the
 Vestry, Truro Parish, Virginia, I732-I785 [Lorton, Va.: Pohock
 Church, 19741], P 58). Blocked barns and granaries in Maryland
 are described in Queen Anne's County Deed Book RT, no. F,
 folios 145, 173, Hall of Records, Annapolis.

 47The ground-laid sills under the Third Haven Meeting
 House (1682), Talbot County, Maryland (T-46), were raised on
 cedar blocks in 1698 and the building new floored; Minute

 Buildings raised on "cratchets." Settlers in the
 Chesapeake colonies and the Leeward Islands
 knew how to build another kind of inexpensive,
 post-supported structure, one whose roof was
 raised on forked poles variously called "cratches,"
 "cratchets," "crochets," "crotches," or "crutches."
 John Smith's account of Jamestown in 16o8 in-
 cludes a good description of such buildings and
 attests to their second place in the familiar, three-
 step homesteading sequence. The Jamestowners'
 first church, he explained, was "an old rotten tent,
 for we had few better . . . till we built a homely
 thing like a barne, set upon Cratchets," which the
 colonists roofed and walled with "rafts, sedge, and
 earth." He added that "the best part of our houses
 [was] of the like curiosity, but the most part farre
 much worse workmanship, that could neither well
 defend wind nor raine."49 Smith's word cratchets
 has been taken by some to mean crucks, but he
 clearly meant slender, forked poles, for elsewhere
 in the same account he described some "poore
 [foot] bridges, onely made of a few cratches thrust
 in the o[o]se, and three or foure poles laid on
 them."50 His earlier choice of the phrase "like a
 barne" (the same analogy that Claypoole later used
 to describe his own temporary dwelling in
 Philadelphia) is suggestive, for poles with naturally
 forked tops were used in England throughout the
 seventeenth century to build seasonal farm

 170, Maryland Hall of Records, Annapolis.

 48 The suggestion has been made that English builders may
 have set sill beams on temporary blocks while raising a frame,
 later replacing them with low plinth walls; Richard Harris, Dis-
 covering Timber-Framed Buildings (Princes Risborough,
 Aylesbury, Bucks, U.K.: Shire Publications, 1978), pp. 16-17. So
 far no evidence of that practice has been observed on early
 American sites or in American buildings. Here blocks were hole
 set to prevent easy dislocation. Earthfast blocks cannot have
 been wholly unfamiliar to English housewrights, for Richard
 Neve's Builder's Dictionary (London: B. Sprint, 1736) recom-
 mends that "the Stem or Stump of a Tree," if charred "to a
 Coal" before it was set in the ground, would "continue a long
 Time without rotting." The virtue of charring or tarring
 earthfast posts was still appreciated at the end of the eighteenth
 century (see Encyclopedia; or a Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and
 Miscellaneous Literature ... [Philadelphia, 1798], s.v. "posts").

 OUTBUILDING

 no literary or archaeological evidence has yet come
 to light that proves or even strongly suggests that
 English settlers raised houses or barns on full-
 cruck trusses. Upper crucks, yes,55 but not on tim-
 bers that reached from the footings to the ridge
 piece.

 Raftered houses. An ancient European building
 type brought to the Chesapeake was the house
 without walls, the primitive, ground-standing A-
 frame that Charles F. Innocent called a "roof

 hut."56 A 1658 Virginia will mentions a 6o-foot to-
 bacco house "with rafters upon the ground.""57
 Another tentlike tobacco house answering that de-
 scription appears on a plat of Jamestown Island
 drawn in 1664.58 The sketch shows an open gable
 with a central pole-conceivably a hole-set
 cratchet-supporting the ridge. The sloping sides
 are depicted as a grid of crisscrossed vertical and
 horizontal lines apparently representing rafters
 and thatching poles. Other roof huts may be in-
 ferred where records make a deliberate distinction

 between "wall plate tobacco houses" and "raftered"
 structures.59 In the Chesapeake the technique
 seems to have been restricted to tobacco shelters.

 Turf-, earth-, and log-walled houses. Com-

 ter, built by Gerret van Sweringen at St. Mary's City,

 buildings-pigsties, cart sheds, hop mangers,
 hayricks, and similar hovels "set upon crotches
 [defined as "forked Posts"] covered with poles and
 [a roof of sticks or] straw."5' When fur traders
 from Virginia established a year-round camp on
 Kent Island in the upper Chesapeake Bay in 1631,
 they built "several thatch-roofed huts set on
 crotches and raftered with a covering of brush."52
 Occasionally the word cratches may have been used
 to describe hefty timbers-the "good and sub-
 stantial cratches ... erected [in 1668] for the mak-
 ing of a good, substantial, and firm cratched-
 house" on the island of Montserrat were appar-
 ently not mere poles.53 But in most English and
 American contexts the term implies wall posts
 whose distinguishing characteristics, whenever de-
 scribed, are their slight size and forked tops.54

 Maryland, records several dwellings and tobacco barns "sup-
 ported by [or "with"] crutches" (Alphabetical List of Lands,
 District 6, 1783 tax assessment, Maryland Historical Society).
 Various meanings can be guessed at-upper crucks possibly, or
 maybe shores or braces, considering that the structures in ques-
 tion almost always are further described as "old," "very old," or
 "like old age." Other evidence strongly favors an interpretation
 that makes the term an archaic dialect word for hole-set posts
 (with or without forked tops). Farmers in southern Maryland
 were still calling the hole-set posts they used to build pole barns
 "crutches" as late as the 1870s (see Edwin W. Beitzell, ed.,
 "Diary of Dr. Joseph L. McWilliams, 1868-1875," Chronicles of
 St. Mary's 25, no. io (October 1977): 8. Meriwether Lewis and
 William Clark, both of Virginia, were still sufficiently ac-
 quainted with cratchet buildings to employ hole-set forked
 poles in framing the temporary shelters they built on their west-
 ern expedition in 18o6 if we can believe a description and il-
 lustration in Patrick Gass, A Journal of the Voyages and Travels ...

 Impermanent Architecture 155

 monplace as post-in-the-ground structures seem to
 have been in English settlements up and down the
 eastern seaboard, not all British colonists traded up
 from a wigwam or a dugout to a clapboard-covered
 frame house.60 The author of a 1650 pamphlet
 promoting New Albion described "six sorts" of
 dwellings in America, the first being the new-
 comer's wigwam and the second "a clove board
 house nailed to posts," obviously the sort we have
 been looking at.61 The third, fourth, and fifth were
 altogether different: "an Irish house of posts
 walled and divided with close watlle hedges, and
 thin turfed above, and thick turfs without below"

 of plank-frame building common in southeastern
 Massachusetts. Although there the planks are fas-
 tened to sills in the earliest surviving structures of
 this type (houses built in the third quarter of the
 seventeenth century), the use of planks for walling
 goes back another forty or fifty years in the
 Plymouth region, perhaps to sill-less impermanent
 buildings where curtain walls stood directly in the
 ground.64 If so, here is another case where the
 practice of embedding uprights directly into the
 ground was improved upon by the addition of
 ground-laid sills. Recalling similar refinements
 in puncheon and stud-frame construction, silled
 plank-frame buildings demonstrate again that
 impermanence was a matter of degree, which is
 only another way of saying a matter of choice.

 (akin perhaps to the "sedge & earth" walled church
 and dwellings in Smith's description of James-
 town); "a log house of young trees 30. feet square
 notched in at corners"; and "a mud-wall house

 thatched or tiled." The sixth and last was the only
 unquestionably durable house type, "a brick house
 or square tower 3. stories high." Whether the au-
 thor had seen all six in English settlements he does
 not say. Conceivably he had, for even log cabins
 had spread to Maryland and Virginia by 1655.62

 Plank-framed houses. There was still another
 short-order construction technique in the British
 immigrant's repertoire. "The poor sort" who set-
 tled in East Jersey, according to an observer in
 1684, "set up a house of two or three rooms them-
 selves, after this manner: the walls are of cloven

 timber about eight or ten inches broad like planks,
 set one end to the ground and the other nailed to the
 raising [plate], which they plaster within" (emphasis
 added).63 Cloven-timber planks recall the tradition

 6" The prevalence of hole-set framed buildings is demon-
 strated best in the southern colonies where many more sites
 have been excavated than elsewhere. There are, however,
 shreds of evidence to suggest that Samuel Symonds was not
 alone among New Englanders in his preference for buildings
 erected on "posts ... standing in the ground," a phrase William
 Bradford used to describe a clapboarded trading post built be-
 fore 1627 at Aptuxcet (Samuel Eliot Morison, ed., Of Plimoth
 Plantation, i62o-i647 [New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1952], p.
 280). The 1630 Isaac Allerton house of Kingston, Mas-
 sachusetts, the first hole-set structure excavated in New En-
 gland, is described in James Deetz, "Plymouth Colony Ar-
 chitecture: Archaeological Evidence from the Seventeenth
 Century," in Architecture in Colonial Massachusetts (Boston: Colo-
 nial Society of Massachusetts, 1979), PP. 49-53.

 Nevill's "loged house" had already served some time as his
 homestead dwelling; he was building a new and better house in
 1662 (Archives of Maryland, 53:232).

 63 Samuel Smith, The History of the Colony of Nova-Caesaria, or
 New-Jersey (Philadelphia: David Hall, 1765), p. 18o (punctuation

 Lawrie. "Raised piece" meant false plate in Virginia (according
 to Paul Buchanan, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation); Joseph
 Moxon's Mechanick Exercises (London, 1678) uses "raising piece"
 as a synonym for wall plate.

 Newcomers to virtually all the American col-
 onies frequently exercised that choice in favor of
 building expediently for the present so as to hus-
 band their labor and capital for the future. He who
 said, "An ordinary House and a good Stock is the
 Planter's Wisdom," spoke for prudent home-
 steaders everywhere.65 Such people had a selection
 of earthfast building types to choose from. Immi-
 grants from the British Isles had probably known
 and built most of them back home, if not always as
 dwellings, then as farm buildings. Those origins
 are more than a little suggested by the oft-repeated
 analogy between Old World barns and New World
 first houses. It has been necessary to review the
 evidence for impermanent building throughout all
 the colonies in order to establish the overall validity
 of the homesteading process, for, as our attention
 turns now to the Chesapeake settlements in Mary-
 land and Virginia, it will be their divergence from
 this general pattern that begs historical explana-
 tion.

 Housewrights in the South used all but a few of
 the earthfast technologies known in seventeenth-
 century America. Their skills included puncheon,
 palisade, and cratchet building (most prevalent in
 the earliest Virginia settlements), log houses and
 frame buildings on blocks (increasingly common
 during the second half of the seventeenth century),
 and hole-set structures with and without inter-

 that it is hard to generalize. While the most primi-
 tive structures tend to be among the earliest-

 gave careful attention to the preservation qualities
 of various woods, as had the Indians, whose lore in
 this matter Europeans heeded.69 Both cultures
 chose those woods that experience showed were
 longest lasting. Sassafras, black locust, red cedar,
 and chestnut were known to be "very durable and
 lasting" and so were preferred, as one writer said
 of sassafras, "for Bowls, Timbers, Posts for Houses,
 and other Things that require standing in the
 Ground."70 Black locust proved to be the favor-
 ite.71 It was plentiful, and, if one can believe Wil-
 liam Fitzhugh, who described a locust fence
 around an orchard on his Potomac River planta-
 tion, it was "as durable as most brick walls." Indeed

 by his reckoning, some heavier "locust Punchens,"
 which "pallizado'd in" his yard, were actually
 "more lasting than any of our bricks."72 Whether
 this was literally true or not, his and his con-
 temporaries' savvy about the best woods for
 earthfast building has been borne out by modern
 experimentation. Cedar and black-locust fence
 posts tested by the Forestry Department at the
 University of Missouri were still going strong after
 eighteen years (the conclusion of the test period).
 Sassafras was serviceable for fourteen. The oaks,
 normally as much a staple in America as in En-
 gland, fared poorly, white oak failing after 12 '/2
 years and red and black oak lasting scarcely
 three.7" Charring the butts beforehand extended
 their serviceable life only marginally (four months
 on average), belying the benefits of a treatment
 prescribed in builders' handbooks and practiced by
 housewrights and barn builders in the Chesapeake
 colonies (Appendix 1:7). The hardiest woods used
 for hole-set posts may sometimes have endured a
 great deal longer. The builder of Cedar Park felled
 the cedar trees nearby for his earthfast posts and
 interrupted sills and selected black locust for the
 sleepers, otherwise the frame is mostly oak. The
 sleepers are still in use after nearly 300 years; the
 posts and sills resisted decay for maybe fifty years
 until the house was encased and underpinned with

 and orderly farmstead at Littletown Plantation (fig.
 9; Appendix 1:3). Likewise it is tempting to inter-
 pret Cedar Park as representing the sophistication
 that some hole-set buildings had attained by the
 end of the seventeenth century. But that ignores
 the fact that many others still resembled the mer-
 chant's dwelling in Stafford County which was de-
 scribed as a "Shell of a house without Chimneys or
 partition and not one tittle of workmanship about it
 more than a Tobacco house work" (again, that allu-
 sion to barns).66 Men's individual preferences and
 their personal wherewithal figured more in their
 choice of impermanent building techniques, it
 appears, than in advances in the state of the art.

 What all earthfast structures had in common

 were certain features that set them as "ordinary
 Virginia houses" apart from those "substantial
 good" dwellings that contemporaries referred to as
 "great houses," not necessarily brick, but, at a
 minimum, "English framed." Clearly they per-
 ceived and understood a difference, one that left
 prospective builders with a choice to make. Before
 exploring why planters in Maryland and Virginia
 made do for so long with second-best buildings in
 preference to those they regarded as affording
 more "comfortable [and] commodious accommo-
 dations," we first need to know in what respects the
 Virginia house was inferior.67

 To speak merely of posts buried in holes in the
 ground can leave the wrong impression. Earthfast
 building was perishable building, no doubt about
 it, but not all hole-set posts and blocks were equally
 vulnerable. It was not necessarily a contradiction in
 term, to talk of a "good Strong Substantial Virginia
 Built house.'"68 Seventeenth-century carpenters

 sound today, including the butts).

 vernacular architecture had traditions of its own,
 doubtless intermingled at many points in its devel-
 opment with the more familiar permanent build-
 ing traditions in England and America, but in no
 oversimple sense a poor man's imitation of
 superior vernacular architecture. Throughout the
 colonial period and beyond impermanent build-
 ings could be found alongside the more durable
 kind and, moreover, were probably built by poor
 and not so poor alike wherever special needs or
 circumstances dictated.76

 Most hole-set structures were not so massively
 built, and force of habit may have disposed many
 builders to use oak regardless. Certainly ar-
 chaeologists find over and over again that hole-set
 uprights had to be repaired and replaced periodi-
 cally if they were to outlast their expected life span
 of a decade or so.74 In the long run these buildings
 proved to be less durable-more impermanent if
 you will-than houses fully framed and set up on
 waterproof foundations. Many homesteaders ex-
 pected no more; they had in mind to build better
 eventually anyway. But we must also entertain the
 possibility that others may have questioned that as-
 sumption, perhaps increasingly so as the sev-
 enteenth century wore on. The long run, after all,
 is something we are able to appreciate and even
 gain a sense of only in retrospect. The virtues we
 see in buildings able to last three centuries may
 have counted for nothing among many prospective
 builders in the seventeenth century for whom the
 short run was plenty long enough, either because
 they planned to replace their make-do houses re-
 gardless or because they planned not to, having
 learned to choose decay-resistant materials and
 make minimal repairs that could keep them
 standing in tolerable condition for thirty, forty,
 fifty years or more. To those of either persuasion,
 impermanence may have been a largely irrelevant
 consideration, and some may have come to regard
 posts in the ground as an acceptable, and less ex-
 pensive, alternative to brick foundations no matter
 how everlasting.

 The Virginia house is a case in point. Its origins
 can be traced to a little-known, archaic (but not
 earthfast), timber-frame tradition still practiced in
 southwestern England in the seventeenth cen-
 tury.77 One among several primitive building types
 brought presumably from various parts of En-
 gland to the Chesapeake region, it proved un-
 usually adaptable to planters' requirements for a
 simplified, economical system of framing that
 minimized joinery and took full advantage of the
 structural quality of riven clapboards. The English
 prototype was essentially a reverse-assembled
 frame. Although standard wall plates occurred in
 modified versions, the salient feature was tie beams

 that extended beyond the wall lines and supported
 the principal rafters entirely independent of the
 posts. By thus effectively disjoining the wall frame
 from the frame of the roof, it avoided the compli-
 cated joinery necessary in buildings of normal as-
 sembly where plates, beams, and rafters all came
 together on each post. A carpenter had to know
 only two joints to build this more primitive struc-
 ture, a straightforward mortise-and-tenon and
 variations on a lap joint. Chesapeake builders sim-
 plified it further (see fig. 3). By the third quarter of
 the seventeenth century, and maybe earlier, they

 Good enough, however, did not make such
 buildings "fair framed English houses." Nor were
 hole-set posts the only concession to economy.
 Those built with earthfast sills (or none at all) and
 earthen floors lowered costs by requiring less car-
 pentry. Wooden chimneys75 saved labor by
 eliminating any need to make brick. But the Vir-
 ginia house was not merely a conventional building
 reduced to basics, not a standard box frame from
 which all frills had been stripped to provide af-
 fordable low-income housing for the poorer sort.
 Rather this primitive or archaic or impermanent

 76 Impermanent structures persisted in England too. Their

 use as seasonal farm buildings has already been noted. Some
 laborers' cottages also employed primitive timber framing.
 Robert Machin believes that as late as the late eighteenth cen-
 tury estate owners still provided such housing (Machin to Cary
 Carson, July 12, 1979); see also entry for Thomas Gale in a 1604
 survey of Thurleigh published by N. W. Alcock in Bedfordshire
 Archaeological Journal 4 (1969): 62. Large earthfast buildings
 with carpentered roofs still made acceptable barns for some
 gentry farmers in the seventeenth century (one built in 1607 is
 described and illustrated in C. B. Robinson, ed., Rural Economy
 in Yorkshire in 164,, Being the Farming and Account Books of Henry
 Best of Elmswell in the East Riding, vol. 33, Publications of the
 Surtees Society [Durham, England, 18571, pp. 47, 170-71).

 "usually endure ten years without Repair" is corroborated by a
 growing body of archaeological evidence.

 smaller than their original extent. It is too complex a topic to
 deal with adequately in this paper and is the subject of another

 only guess at. Was, for instance, the technique of
 using clapboards as structural sheathing employed
 first in very primitive puncheon buildings (whose
 frames may have needed additional stiffening) and
 only afterward appropriated to "ordinary be-
 ginners" houses? Were multiple tie beams adopted
 from cratchet building? What does seem clear is
 that archaeologists and architectural historians
 must search among such recondite folkways as
 these for the real origins of vernacular architecture
 in the southern colonies. The Virginia house, how-
 ever outlandish it appears to modern English eyes,
 had ancestors and even living relations back home
 to no less extent than those vernacular buildings
 whose genealogies are readily traced through gen-
 erations of standing structures. Impermanent
 buildings merely descended from a different
 lineage, although ultimately, back beyond the
 "vernacular threshold," English archaeologists are
 beginning to find some common progenitors.

 had rediscovered the trussed-rafter roof, a roof
 composed entirely of collared common rafters.
 Their use of it appears to be a case of independent
 invention prompted by the discovery that short
 riven-oak or riven-chestnut clapboards nailed di-
 rectly to the rafters lent an entire roof frame most
 of the longitudinal rigidity it needed. Wind-braces
 sometimes helped stiffen it; but with or without
 them, a light, tight covering of clapboards replaced
 the need for a heavily framed roof of principal
 rafters and purlins.78 A lighter roof also simplified
 the problem of marrying it to the walls below. Un-
 like principal rafters, which concentrated the
 weight of a roof directly on the posts, common-
 rafter roofs distributed the burden evenly. Build-
 ers of Virginia houses capitalized on that inherent
 mechanical advantage by providing a tie beam for
 every pair of rafters (thereby also eliminating the
 many-jointed summer beams and common joists).
 Tie beams spaced uniformly every 20o to 30 inches
 along the whole length of a building were easily
 notched over (occasionally with a lap dovetail) and
 pinned down into the wall plates without regard to
 post positions. Each rafter couple was either mor-
 tised and tenoned to its tie beam or, simpler still,
 lapped over and nailed to a secondary plate. This
 member, called a "false plate" or "raising piece" by
 the Chesapeake builders who made it a virtual
 hallmark of their work, was borrowed from the

 Americans must be content to affirm that
 seventeenth-century builders still practiced a vari-
 ety of permanent and impermanent building tech-
 niques and chose whichever best suited their par-
 ticular needs. Southerners built some structures in

 simple imitation of those left behind in England.
 Others they tinkered and dabbled with until,
 finally, they had custom made an impermanent
 structure that was the perfect accompaniment to a
 planter's special circumstances and way of life.
 They acknowledged its continuing utility by
 building and rebuilding it until it became almost
 second nature. But their acceptance of it was
 grudging. Needing it did not mean they had to like
 it. Its rotting posts and gray, unpainted clapboard
 walls and roofs were nagging reminders to many
 that their fondest aspirations remained un-
 fulfilled.80 We know because their own words be-

 same parent English prototype. In buildings of re-
 verse assembly, it ran along the upper ends of the
 tie beams and acted as the wall plate until the in-
 troduction of post-connected plates made it re-
 dundant. American builders retained it and even-

 tually had the bright idea to tilt it forty-five degrees
 so that the common rafters could be hitched over
 its upper edge with barely a hatchet-made notch
 and a nail or two to hold them in place. Scantling
 for the rafters, collars, and false plates was some-
 times split to size (like fence rails), other times
 hewn from small stock, but seldom sawn, for that
 was time-consuming and to be avoided where
 economy was the aim.79

 they guarantee a longer future, but because they reflect favor-
 ably on their owners in the present: "We tend to take it for
 granted that buildings are solidly constructed so that they may
 last for a long time. But permanence is not likely to be the most
 elementary consideration. Any concern with the future or the
 past is less immediate than a concern with the present. Firmness
 and solidity are, first of all, a property of the present state of

 in 1662, "our ability [is] not extending to build
 stronger" than "a house after the forme of a Vir-
 ginia house."81 A century later apologists were still
 complaining that, as run-of-the-mill farmhouses
 went, it was "impossible to devise things more ugly,
 uncomfortable, and happily more perishable.'"82
 Historians ought to find it reassuring to hear

 that deserves serious attention, the duration of the
 rebuilding process. The shorter or longer period
 of years it takes for a people to cross the vernacular
 threshold can have much to do with the manner of
 building that they eventually adopt. To put it
 another way, the longer that traditions of im-
 permanent and permanent vernacular building
 coexist the more the former is likely to bequeath an
 inheritance directly to the latter.

 southerners express the familiar hopes of home-
 steaders elsewhere for pretty, comfortable, and
 imperishable houses even though in practice they
 had good reasons to build otherwise. It helps nar-
 row down the range of explanations for their
 choice by discounting the suggestion that some
 basic flaw in the southern character accounted for

 the region's long delay in achieving the degree of
 settledness that other colonists reached after only a
 generation or two. It directs attention instead to
 external circumstances that thwarted the ambition

 of ordinary Virginia and Maryland planters to
 build farmsteads that were a credit to themselves
 and an asset to their children. As we turn now to

 inquire into the nature of the considerations that
 weighed in a planter's decision to repair an old
 post-in-the-ground building or replace it with
 another no better, we have an opportunity rare for
 historians and archaeologists to peer inside the
 minds of people whose circumstances had brought
 them to that cultural divide we call the vernacular
 threshold. Those who crossed it and built an en-

 during architecture have understandably received
 more scholarly attention than those who are the
 subject of this essay, the men and women who took
 stock of their needs and deemed them better

 served by an older, more rudimentary tradition of
 material culture.

 Interpretation

 Timing is critical to understanding the impetus to
 intensive rebuilding. Dates were the starting point
 for W. G. Hoskins when he formulated his "great
 rebuilding" thesis, and dates have been the matter
 most debated in reassessments of his work.83 Tim-

 New England's great rebuilding-its first
 one-was accomplished in the space of the five or
 six decades immediately following the settlement
 of Massachusetts in 1630. As early as midcentury
 settlers there could wonder that "the Lord hath
 been pleased to turn all the wigwams, huts, and
 hovels the English dwelt in at their first coming
 into orderly, fair, and well-built houses, well fur-
 nished many of them, together with Orchards
 filled with goodly fruit trees and gardens with vari-
 ety of flowers."84 Timber-framed houses were so
 much the rule by the turn of the century that a
 Boston woman traveling through the Narragansett
 country in 1704 could be surprised on coming
 upon a windowless, floorless cottage "suported
 with shores [meaning stakes, probably puncheons]
 enclosed with Clapboards laid on Lengthways." In
 all her experience, she confessed, that "little Hutt
 was one of the wretchedest I ever saw a habitation
 for human creatures."85

 Modern scholarship confirms the implication of
 her remarks; primitively framed dwellings had
 been steadily replaced throughout the seventeenth
 century in New England to such an extent that
 those few that lasted past 1700 were oddities ex-
 citing curiosity. A recent study of vernacular
 buildings in Massachusetts has identified fully to
 extant houses built before 166o, another 61 before
 1700, and over loo in the period 1701-25, for a
 total of 257 known First Period houses in that one
 former colony alone (including 83 undocumented
 structures assigned to the period on stylistic
 grounds).86 Others from northern New England,
 Rhode Island, and Connecticut add to their num-
 bers. Most are timber framed, a few brick or stone,

 ing also has a corollary in another consideration

 but all without exception would qualify as "orderly,
 fair, and well-built." As the promotional literature
 promised, homestead housing was punctually re-
 placed in New England by people who not only
 were accustomed to higher standards in the En-
 glish villages they came from but also whose cir-
 cumstances in America were such that it made

 Example, for hithertoe wee Liue in Cottages."'9
 Most ordinary planters were literally cottagers, but
 not everyone. Here and there a few lesser men
 managed to build "good and sufficient framed"
 houses too; none still stand but they are occasion-
 ally described in building contracts. The terms
 almost always make specific mention of the major
 feature-groundsills "underpinned with
 bricks"-that set "framed worke" apart from the

 good sense to build soundly as soon as they were
 able. The process was a simple one of substitu-
 tion.87 The primitive, barnlike, but thoroughly En-
 glish structures that immigrant builders resorted to
 for the purpose of launching their American
 plantations were replaced by thoroughly English
 houses of a very different kind-fully carpentered,
 timber-framed houses in keeping with New En-
 glanders' view of their prospects for the future.
 Used for dwellings for so short a time, the technol-
 ogy of primitive building had almost no opportu-
 nity to modify the traditions of permanent ver-
 nacular architecture.88 Consequently, surviving
 vernacular buildings in New England closely re-
 semble their English counterparts.89

 The experience of planters in Maryland and

 Virginia was very different. If the same two
 indicators--timing and duration-are applied, the
 late commencement of a general rebuilding
 throughout the region and its extreme prolonga-
 tion stand in marked contrast to New England. In
 the South there are no surviving buildings what-
 soever from the first half of the seventeenth cen-

 tury despite the region's greater age, size, popula-
 tion, and prosperity. That is not to deny that no
 one built well. Excavations at Mathews Manor and
 Jamestown in Virginia and at St. John's in St.
 Mary's City, Maryland, have brought to light the
 foundations of some fairly substantial brick- and
 timber-framed dwellings, usually built (where the
 owners are known) by officials and other prom-
 inent citizens.90 One of their kind, writing to Lord
 Baltimore in 1638, explained one reason for a col-
 ony's leaders to build well. He had under con-

 struction a house "of sawn Timber framed A story
 a half hygh, with a seller and Chimnies of brick,"
 he said, "toe Encourage others toe follow my

 commonality of earthfast cottages.92

 Were data available to draw a graph that
 showed the replacement rate for impermanent
 buildings in the southern colonies, the line would
 inch upward almost imperceptibly before 1700. A
 few buildings have survived from the period after
 166o, but only a handful, a total of five or six from
 the entire region and most of those from the very
 end of the century or the first few years after 1700.
 They are far too few to tell us much of anything
 about the frequency of better-built houses, even
 among the small group of successful merchants
 and well-to-do planters to whom they belonged.
 Their significance is all the more obscured by off-
 setting archaeological evidence that indicates that
 other, equally wealthy, well-connected men were
 content to go on building and repairing earthfast
 farmsteads for decades. William Drummond, who
 lived on the Governor's Land near Jamestown
 (Appendix 2:16), was one. Another was Col.
 Thomas Pettus (originally from Essex), a vestry-
 man, councillor, land speculator, and builder of
 one of the largest post-in-the-ground domestic
 structures so far discovered (see fig. 9; Appendix
 1:3). Yet despite contradictions in the evidence,
 our imaginary replacement curve probably ought
 to show a blip or two near the close of the century
 when a Frenchman traveling through Virginia in
 1687 noted in his journal that "they have started
 making bricks in quantities, and I have seen several
 houses where the walls were entirely made of
 them.""93 This flurry of new construction con-
 tinued, warranting by 1705 Robert Beverley's ob-
 servation that "private buildings are of late very
 much improved," notably, he had to add in
 qualification, those of "several Gentlemen" who

 87 Notwithstanding cases like Samuel Symonds's where an
 impermanent house was later substantially improved, the more
 likely practice is spelled out in a building contract of 1679 be-
 tween John Williams of Boston and a housewright who was
 engaged to raze an older house before building Williams a new
 one (Cummings, "Massachusetts and Its First Period Houses,"
 p. 204).

 had recently "built themselves large Brick
 Houses.""9 Fifty years after rebuilding had trans-
 formed New England, the Chesapeake grandees
 were only getting started.

 Less affluent neighbors had longer to wait. One
 effect of the recent archaeological excavations in
 the region has been to open historians' eyes to the
 fact that most plantation houses were small, poorly
 built, frequently repaired, and often rebuilt no
 better than before throughout the seventeenth
 century and much of the next. Typical was the
 complaint of planters living in the neighborhood
 of Charles City, Virginia, who reported that they
 were rebuilding "such houses as [they had] before
 and in them lived with continual repairs, and
 buildinge new where the old failed."95 In rural lo-
 calities housewrights could work for months and
 never set hand to a single "framed or English built"
 house as late as the 169os, although, starting about
 then, impermanent buildings raised on blocks
 began competing with hole-set framed houses.96

 bay in Anne Arundel County the excavation of
 Middle Plantation (figs. 10, 11, 12; Appendix 1:7)
 has dramatically demonstrated that whole
 farmsteads-houses, barns, kitchens, quarters,
 dairies, coolers, meat houses, root cellars, hen
 coops, everything-were continuously built and
 rebuilt through the middle of the century in a
 fashion that left behind archaeological evidence no
 more substantial than the site's fence-post holes
 and grave pits. Intensive rebuilding was delayed
 until after 18oo in the region's poorest districts-
 backwaters such as St. Mary's County, Maryland,
 parts of southside Virginia, and Albemarle Sound,
 North Carolina." At the head of the bay in nearby
 Delaware "mud houses" lingered on to be recorded
 by tax assessors until the eighteen teens.100 In
 short, throughout the Chesapeake region the re-
 placement of homestead housing was slow to start
 and then was attenuated and prolonged for more
 than a century until finally it was subsumed in the
 first truly nationwide rebuilding of the early
 nineteenth century. Only at that point, say, the
 period 182o-50, would trend lines for New En-
 gland and the Old South finally converge.

 last 250 years, only began to appear with some fre-
 quency in the seventeen teens, twenties, and thir-
 ties, the first period from which perhaps loo or
 more buildings survive. They include large houses
 in disproportionate number, as would be expected,
 but also a smattering of one-room dwellings. Con-
 sequently, our replacement curve should ascend
 more steeply after about 172o, but its rise should
 show only a steady, gradual improvement, no pre-
 cipitous climb, for in fact primitive, impermanent,
 even earthfast building continued in strength for
 years to come. Not until the 174os, for example,
 were "post in the ground" and "bastard frame"
 buildings so uncommon on the upper eastern shore
 of Maryland that they were singled out for special
 mention in orphans court valuations where they
 were sometimes further denigrated by the term
 old-fashioned.97 Even twenty-five years later
 there were still houses in that neighborhood with
 open halls, some with chimneys, but others no
 doubt as rudimentary as the one that had "a little

 Where hardy strains of impermanent ar-
 chitecture persevered for the better part of two
 centuries in the South, they had ample opportunity
 to exert a formative influence on the growth of the
 region's lasting vernacular building traditions.
 True, there were cases where homestead struc-
 tures were replaced in good time by strictly
 English-framed buildings. Such cases of simple
 substitution would more likely have occurred, we
 expect, earlier rather than later in the seventeenth
 century, that is to say, before southern house-

 Indifference-a kind of cultural malaise-is an

 Were there chronic disabilities that plagued south-
 ern society, or, despite their protests to the con-
 trary, were southerners really content to live from
 hand to mouth?

 wrights began improvising on impermanent
 building types from England to create the indige-
 nous impermanent Virginia house previously de-
 scribed. Certainly every one of the few surviving
 houses from the late seventeenth and early
 eighteenth centuries, whether brick built or
 framed on sills, incorporates one or more features
 taken over from the Virginia house: its common-
 rafter roof frame, its system of tie beams and false
 plates, its clapboards used as structural elements,
 and so on. Indeed the magnitude of the southern
 builder's debt to the region's impermanent ar-
 chitectural tradition is only fully appreciated by
 looking ahead at the timber-framed house type
 that became absolutely standard and universal in
 the eighteenth century throughout Maryland, Vir-
 ginia, the Carolinas, and eventually all those
 trans-Appalachian states settled by migrants from
 the tidewater South.101 Virtually every member of
 its frame, save the continuous groundsills, can be
 traced back a hundred years or more to origins in
 the Virginia house.

 appealing explanation for some men's circum-
 stances. Edmund Morgan has described Virginia in
 the 162os as a boom country, a time and a place
 when the extraordinarily high price of tobacco
 produced a mining-camp mentality.102 Planters
 were prospectors who came to strike it rich and
 looked on Virginia "not as a place of Habitacion
 but onely of a short sojourninge."103 He finds the
 governing council of the Virginia Company com-
 plaining in 1626 that fortune seekers cared only
 for "a present Cropp, and their hastie re-
 tourne."104 Easy come, easy go was the prevailing
 mood. Often as not planters gambled or drank
 away the profits from their yearly crop or squan-
 dered them on frippery like the "fresh flaming
 silkes" reportedly worn by the cow keeper at
 Jamestown or a collier's wife's "rough beaver hatt
 with a faire hattband, and a silken suite therto cor-

 The practice of repairing this and replacing
 that, when multiplied innumerable times over
 many years, in fact became the process by which
 southern architecture was transformed. The set of

 accounts that records the repeated renovations to a
 courthouse built in 1674 in Charles County,
 Maryland (Appendix 3), reveals not only how
 specific buildings could be coaxed across the ver-
 nacular threshold, but how thoroughly by the end
 of the seventeenth century an archaic building
 technology had become mainstream tradition.
 Eventually its vulnerable earthfast features-hole-
 set posts and studs and ground-laid sills-were
 winnowed out and eliminated in preference to
 wooden blocks, brick piers, and, finally, full foun-
 dations. But, for a considerable time, posts in the
 ground were acceptable to many builders of houses
 otherwise as strongly constructed as Cedar Park,
 because the two traditions had so thoroughly
 intermingled and because the process of rebuild-
 ing was so thoroughly an evolutionary one.

 Archaeological evidence that forms such an
 unusual pattern of cultural development raises two
 important historical questions. Why were immi-
 grants to the Chesapeake colonies so much slower
 than settlers elsewhere to establish an enduring
 material culture, and, when once a few began, what
 circumstances retarded its acceptance generally?

 o10 Paul E. Buchanan, "The Eighteenth-Century Frame
 Houses of Tidewater Virginia," in Building Early America: Con-
 tributions toward the History of a Great Industry, ed. Charles E.
 Peterson (Radnor, Pa.: Chilton Book Co., 1976), pp. 54-73.

 respondent."'105 Such people, the argument goes,
 had little use for well-built houses and sturdy farm
 buildings. Stopping places only, boom towns are
 shantytowns the world over. The archaeological
 record has to be stretched to fit this interpretation.
 Apart from some jewelry and fragments of gold
 and silver thread used to trim clothing, the artifacts
 recovered from sites of the sixteen teens and twen-

 ties do not bear witness to Virginia's sottish ways
 and tawdry vices. The most that can be said is that
 some sites present a notable contrast between the
 quantity and quality of discarded artifacts and the
 flimsiness of associated dwellings, barns, out-
 buildings, and enclosures.106

 A more serious objection is that Morgan's
 boom-town hypothesis lays a false scent for the
 period as a whole. While tobacco mania may have
 had a contributing effect in encouraging construc-
 tion of ramshackle housing during the second de-
 cade of the century, as an explanation it fails to fit
 the known facts. First of all, historians cannot sub-
 stantiate the complaint about opportunists re-
 turning to England with tobacco fortunes salted

 expiration of [the] tenant's time, the plantation
 [would] not be in better order than the way before
 proposed."112 All things considered and given the
 state of the economy in Maryland and Virginia in
 the final decades of the seventeenth century, the
 absence of surviving buildings from that period
 should come as no surprise, nor should the evi-
 dence that many tenants and small freeholders
 spent those years patching, repairing, and shoring
 up dilapidated structures that had long since out-
 lived their expected usefulness.

 The effect on family life was devastating. Few
 children grew up in the care of both their natural
 parents. Two of every three lost either a mother or
 a father before coming of age; one of three lost
 both. Orphans were legion; orphans and guard-
 ians and stepparents and half brothers and sisters
 sometimes all lived under one roof."16 Fathers had
 no assurance that the wealth they accumulated
 would be passed on to their heirs in ways they
 could anticipate. Widows remarried, estates were
 broken up, and guardians not uncommonly de-
 spoiled their wards' inheritances. The law permit-
 ted the sale of orphans' property to preserve the
 value of their assets, but such action effectively dis-
 possessed them of their fathers' farmsteads.17
 These were excellent reasons not to plan too far
 ahead or build things to last. Better to put profits
 back into production and spend disposable income
 on material comforts that could be enjoyed im-
 mediately. Planters 300 years ago may have made
 such choices deliberately. If so, their trash pits
 would yield just what archaeologists have found on
 most early sites in Maryland and Virginia, a wealth
 of utensils used for eating, drinking, and storing
 food, articles of apparel and personal adornment,
 farm tools, weapons, and even such architectural
 frills as delft fireplace tiles and fancy casement
 windows, all in association with buildings guaran-
 teed to last a lifetime-a planter's lifetime-and
 not much more.

 Tobacco madness in the 162os and economic

 stagnation after 168o were not the only obstacles to
 a settled way of life in the South. Disease and an
 abnormally high mortality rate among immigrants
 were fundamental sources of social instability. Fig-
 ures alone tell the grim story. Male immigrants
 who lived to celebrate their twenty-second birth-
 days were already middle-aged. Seventeen percent
 of them would be dead before they were thirty, 41
 percent before the age of forty, and 70 percent
 before fifty.113 In contrast, a boy who reached his
 majority in New England in the same middle de-
 cades of the century could expect to live another
 fifty years; forty for those who grew up in rural
 England.114 Contemporaries called the killer "sea-
 soning," a process of adjusting to the Chesapeake
 climate in which malaria left its victims sickly and
 susceptible to other, fatal illnesses.""15

 Still and all, it must have been human nature
 for healthy people to suppose that they would con-
 tinue to be the lucky ones, that their lives would be
 spared. The survivors looked forward no doubt to
 improving their housing standards as soon as cir-
 cumstances allowed. But, unfortunately, circum-
 stances had a way of not allowing, not after 168o,
 because the market for tobacco went bad, and gen-
 erally not throughout the period as a whole, be-
 cause for many men and women both luck and life
 ran out. Fathers and mothers died, family assets
 were dispersed, old buildings fell hopelessly into

 shoes-that previously they had purchased from
 abroad with income from the sale of the staple.
 The tobacco market's recovery in the seventeen
 teens brought a mixed response from smaller
 planters.121 In a few localities they never went back
 to growing the crop, having developed in the
 meantime lucrative trades in specialized local
 products. The more common practice was to take
 up planting again but to supplement tobacco with
 other cash crops and exports. Meat, corn, wheat,
 fruits and vegetables, dairy products, firewood,
 naval stores, shingles, and staves found expanding
 markets in the islands, in the region's growing
 towns and cities, and in a hungry population that
 multiplied twelvefold in the hundred years ending
 in i8oo. By that date, mixed farming and the craft
 activities needed to support it had replaced the re-
 gion's heavy dependence on tobacco everywhere
 except in southern Maryland and southside Vir-
 ginia.

 Examples are too numerous to be explained as
 mere coincidence. Take Lower Norfolk County,
 Virginia, for instance (fig. 13, no. 1). Its planters
 gave up tobacco in the middle 168os never to plant
 it again in marketable quantities. Between 1700
 and the 1720s they turned overwhelmingly to the
 cultivation of cereal grains, mostly corn, but in the
 meantime they had avoided the worst rigors of de-
 pression by developing a brisk island trade in tar,
 pitch, and pork. It is surely significant that the ear-
 liest small brick houses in Virginia, buildings of the
 late seventeenth century and very early eighteenth,
 are concentrated in the Lynnhaven district of
 Lower Norfolk (later Princess Anne) County.123 In
 the same general area a one-room frame house
 dated 1714 still stands along the banks of the Nan-
 semond River.124

 While systematic surveys of vernacular ar-

 chitecture in the region are nowhere as advanced
 as studies of its local economies, county-by-county
 inventories of historic structures compiled by state
 preservation agencies in Maryland and in Virginia
 are now sufficiently numerous to be used to draw a
 map that shows the distribution of surviving
 buildings in several localities on both sides of the
 bay (fig. 13).122 An intelligible pattern emerges at

 the shore (no. 6), and the same explanation of-
 fered.127

 No region demonstrates the sensitive re-
 lationship between agriculture and vernacular
 building better than the bay-side counties on the
 lower eastern shore of Maryland (no. 3). Recent re-
 search suggests that tobacco production declined
 after 168o in Somerset County. It recovered again
 in the 173os, strongly in Monie, Manokin, and
 Annemessex hundreds, but only marginally on the
 neck of land between the Wicomico and Nanticoke

 rivers (the area that became Wicomico County).
 There (no. 4) corn began to rival the traditional
 staple, and by the 1750os corn surpluses were prob-
 ably worth more than the tobacco crop. Be that as
 it may-and herein lies the instructive
 comparison-Somerset County (the three lower
 hundreds) produced corn too, actually more per
 acre than Wicomico farms but never in quantities
 that matched the value of the tobacco crop. In
 short, both sections engaged in mixed farming,
 one favoring corn, the other tobacco.126 Yet, re-
 building in the two areas followed different
 courses. A chronological distribution of surviv-
 ing structures in Wicomico duplicates a pattern
 common to other early cereal-growing regions:
 permanent vernacular buildings began to appear in
 numbers when grain production overtook the ex-
 port of tobacco and their frequency increased
 steadily from then to the mid-nineteenth century.
 Rebuilding in Somerset by contrast gathered
 momentum little by little throughout the
 eighteenth century, then suddenly boomed after
 1790 for a period of thirty or forty years. In so
 doing, it behaved like other regions where tobacco
 remained the dominant export. There seems no
 denying that cash crops are a historian's best clue
 to predicting the time and the place of widespread
 rebuilding.

 There was no cash crop to bring wealth to the
 subsistence farms of Worcester County, hemmed
 in between the Pocomoke marshes and the Atlantic

 The fertile plain above the Choptank River, the
 upper eastern shore, followed a different course
 (no. 7). It became the breadbasket of the
 Chesapeake in this period. The shift from tobacco
 to wheat was under way by the 172os on farms at
 the head of the bay where wagons plied back and
 forth to Philadelphia. Wheat superseded tobacco
 as the major market crop in Kent County by 1750
 and was becoming a significant source of income
 for planters as far south as Talbot County,
 although many, especially those seated near con-
 venient navigation, continued to rely chiefly on to-
 bacco until after 1775. By the fourth quarter of the
 century the rapidly expanding city of Baltimore
 added its demand to the market for locally grown
 foodstuffs (no. 8). Farmers responded accordingly,
 so much so that what was said of Baltimore County
 in 1794-"wheat has turned away Tobacco; and
 the erection of Grist Mills and the growing of
 Wheat go Hand in Hand, increasing yearly
 everywhere"-applied generally to the northern
 counties on both shores.128 Surviving vernacular
 buildings chart the progress of diversification from
 the head of the bay southward. A group of dated
 brick houses above Chestertown, Kent County,
 span the years from 1721 to the eighties, but the
 greatest number record dates in the sixties and the
 seventies.'29 Below Kent in Queen Anne's County,
 an area surveyed with great thoroughness, four of
 every five surviving eighteenth-century houses
 belong to the last quarter of the century and in-
 clude the first extant frame houses in the
 county.130 Less precise but similar numbers hold
 too for the upper western shore.131

 Southern Maryland, that whole region lying
 between the bay and the navigable length of the
 Potomac, was premier tobacco country throughout
 the period, indeed to the Civil War (no. 9). Its
 planters grew just enough corn to eat and late in

 gion. The absence of systematic fieldwork leaves a
 large hole in our distribution map, which is only
 poorly compensated for by the tentative observa-
 tion that Virginia planters' devotion to tobacco in
 the area seems to have left the usual smattering of
 substantial brick farmhouses from the first half of

 the century small quantities of grain to sell, but
 tobacco was almost as much the unchallenged cash
 crop in 18oo as it had been ever since this oldest
 part of Maryland was settled. Six early houses still
 stand in the area, but, even as exceptions that
 prove the rule, they are of limited significance con-
 sidering that three of the frame structures132 were
 only saved by the expedient of later encasing them
 inside brick walls and the single original brick
 dwelling133 was the residence not of a true planter,
 but of a wealthy merchant. The real history of re-
 building in southern Maryland is well represented
 by St. Mary's County. A comprehensive survey of
 all historic structures in that area shows even more

 the eighteenth century, but virtually no small,
 frame houses (except perhaps around Tappahan-
 nock) until the seventies, eighties, and nineties. By
 then investments in corn, wheat (especially in
 northern Virginia), and other diversified crops ex-
 ceeded the commitment to tobacco with the pre-
 dictable effect that rebuilding gathered force until
 the 184os at least. Beyond that cautious statement
 nothing more can be said about improved housing
 standards in bay-side tidewater Virginia until reli-
 able surveys are undertaken.

 clearly than Somerset the slight extent to which
 tobacco agriculture stimulated improved building
 standards.134 Of more than 150 extant structures
 built before 186o only four date from the early
 eighteenth century, not quite a score from the
 middle decades, and barely that number again
 from the last third of the century. There is no sign,
 in other words, of even the very gradually acceler-
 ated rate of rebuilding that the mixed economy of
 Somerset County sustained prior to the building
 boom that started there in the 1790s. The first burst
 of building activity in St. Mary's County came about
 ten years later. So did the first attempts at di-
 versification, and then only successfully in the few
 coastal neighborhoods where broad alluvial plains
 provided enough tillable acreage for wheat fields.
 These were precisely the areas where many small,
 single-story, frame houses (described in the 1798
 federal tax assessment) were replaced in the early
 18oos by much larger, often two-story, brick dwell-
 ings. Once begun, the rebuilding continued un-
 abated through the 1840s, its progress unaffected
 by the embargo on tobacco in 18o8 and the crop's
 lackluster performance after 1820. Prices for
 wheat remained high throughout the period.

 Farther south still, farmhouse-sized buildings
 on the three great necks of land between the
 Potomac and the James (no. i o) have been ne-
 glected by scholars in proportion to their pre-
 occupation with the celebrated mansions of the re-

 Vernacular buildings in the southern and
 southside counties of Virginia had received even
 less attention from architectural historians except
 for a group of houses in the neighborhood of the
 Blackwater River dividing Surry from Sussex (no.
 11).135 Like southern Maryland, Surry returned to
 growing tobacco after 1720 and kept up its pro-
 duction for as long as historians have followed the
 county's economic development. Surviving houses
 in the interior of that county are exceedingly rare
 even from the middle decades of the century. Fi-
 nally in the 178os and 1790s small, one- and two-
 room brick farmhouses made the kind of sudden
 appearance along the river that elsewhere
 heralded the advent of grain growing. If by now
 our hypothesis has acquired predictive powers, it
 can be supposed that diversification in Surry and
 Sussex will date from the closing years of the cen-
 tury.

 All around the bay, then, wherever recent
 studies of local agricultural economies can be
 placed alongside surveys of vernacular architec-
 ture, a picture emerges of tobacco planters diver-
 sifying their cash crops and soon after replacing
 impermanent buildings with houses and barns
 substantial enough to have survived in considerable
 numbers to the present day. How mixed farming
 encouraged rebuilding is not yet clearly under-
 stood but enough is known to attempt an explana-
 tion. New markets abroad and a growing popula-
 tion at home increased demand for wheat and

 access to labor and how he was able to employ it
 throughout the growing season. Tobacco and corn
 required regular attention from planting to har-
 vest; wheat once sown was left unattended until

 dependent."138

 reaping time but then, in the space of a few critical
 weeks, all available hands were needed from sunup
 to sundown to bring in the vulnerable crop.136
 Slaveholders who owned enough land to grow
 wheat and tobacco could use their labor force to

 plant both and gamble that the grain would ripen
 by early summer after the young tobacco plants
 were transplanted. When the weather cooperated
 these larger planters got in two cash crops and two
 incomes with the same labor force.

 Small producers could profit too, even without
 owning slaves because harvest was the only time
 when extra labor was needed; a man and his family
 could plant more acres in small grains than they
 themselves could harvest as long as hired hands or
 help from neighbors could be obtained when the
 ripened crop was ready to be gathered. Grain cul-
 ture, therefore, opened up to small growers eco-
 nomic opportunities on a scale that in an exclusively
 tobacco economy required ownership of slaves or
 indentured servants.

 Corn and wheat offered other advantages.
 They were much easier for farmers to process
 than tobacco which, when cut, had to be hung,
 cured, taken down again, stripped, sorted, tied
 into hands, and packed into hogsheads. Through-
 out the Chesapeake wheat was efficiently threshed
 by horse treading, after which it, like shucked corn,
 was ready for milling or could be economically
 transported in the seed to local markets. Food crops
 destined for southern Europe or the West Indies
 were subject to many of the same hazards and ex-
 penses-and profits-of the tobacco trade. But
 foodstuffs sold locally or in regional trading net-
 works spared farmers the high cost of overseas
 transportation, insurance, and faraway middle-
 men's services. Grain culture may also have
 lessened poorer planters' indebtedness to the store-
 keepers who extended them credit for essential
 manufactured goods as a lien against next year's
 crop.1'37 Historians have not yet decided how tightly
 merchants held tobacco planters in debt, but
 one Marylander remembered that "as the culture
 of wheat, and the manufacturing it into flour
 travelled southward, the people became more
 happy, and independent of the British store-
 keepers who had kept them in debts and

 All in all, marketing foodstuffs was less en-
 tangling; sold locally it avoided the risks inherent
 in venturing a luxury crop in an unpredictable
 foreign market, it returned a steady, reliable
 annual income, and-basic to our explanation
 for the spate of rebuilding that finally removed
 most impermanent dwellings from the southern
 landscape-it minimized for small producers the
 disadvantage of not employing a large force
 of slave laborers. In short, corn and wheat built

 many modest fortunes. Profits from grain growing
 found their way into the pockets of even the
 poorest agriculturalists-tenant farmers. The
 dwellings of those who leased property on the pro-
 prietary manors of Maryland, when surveyed in
 1767-68, were found to be smallest and meanest in
 southern Maryland, slightly more commodious in
 Kent and Baltimore counties (although still not
 much affected by the recent shift there to wheat
 production), and largest and best built on the lease
 lots of Monocacy Manor in Frederick County (no.
 12) where wheat and rye had been major cash
 crops since the valley was settled in the 1740s. Not
 since the heyday of tobacco planting in the mid-
 seventeenth century had small farmers enjoyed
 such a favorable economic outlook. The difference

 this time was that, being more likely to live out
 their natural years and surer of an orderly inher-
 itance, many solidified their gains and improved,
 not just replaced, old-fashioned homestead hous-
 ing. Eighteenth-century property owners settled
 bequests on members of their immediate families
 much more often than had been the practice ear-
 lier and frequently with much greater attention to
 how the legacy was to descend to their children's

 Rural Affairs (2d ed.; Philadelphia: Thomas Dobson, 18ol), p.
 301. The adverse effect of tobacco culture on the independence
 and self-sufficiency of small farmers can be seen from a modern
 example to work in reverse, that is to say, where diversified
 crops are given up to grow tobacco, sharecroppers and small
 producers experience the declining standards of living de-
 scribed by Harry Crews in his recollections of Bacon County,
 Georgia, in the 1920s: "Before tobacco came into Bacon
 County, the farmers were self-sufficient in a way they were
 never to be again. In the days before tobacco they grew every-
 thing they needed and lived pretty well. Since they were too far
 south to grow wheat, they had to buy flour. But almost every-
 thing else they really wanted, they could grow .... But tobacco
 took so much of their time and energy and worry that they
 stopped growing many of the crops they had grown before.
 Consequently, they had to depend upon the money from the
 tobacco to buy what they did not grow. A failed tobacco crop
 then was a genuine disaster that affected not just the individual
 farmer but the economy of the entire county" (Harry Crews, A
 Childhood: The Biography of a Place [New York: Harper & Row,
 1978], p. 27).

 them with.

 Our explanation for the belated advent and
 long duration of the "great rebuilding" in the
 southern colonies has emphasized conditions
 largely beyond the control of individual planters.
 Demographic balance and social stability were, we
 have argued, prerequisites to the settled way of life
 that brought with it the opportunity to make a
 house a home. Even then, normalcy and order
 were often insufficient by themselves to break to-
 bacco's stranglehold on many smaller planters.

 why, it might be asked, did quite ordinary farmers
 choose to spend their profits from wheat and corn
 on better, not just newer, housing? Such choices
 imply preferences, and preferences raise questions
 about motives. When desire operates on a person's
 will causing it to act in certain ways, outside in-
 fluences have been converted into intensely per-
 sonal, internal impulses. Usually these are ex-
 tremely difficult for historians to fathom, and this
 case is no exception. But the attempt is worth
 making, because mentalities are the real locus of
 cultural change. The "vernacular threshold" was a
 state of mind before it became an architectural re-

 As for impermanent architecture, this essay has
 shown that it cannot simply be labeled "medieval"
 (although it employed some very ancient methods
 of construction), nor is it accurate to ascribe to its
 builders and users "peasant mentalities." On the
 contrary, as far back as southern planters can be
 heard expressing their sentiments about im-

 that Maryland settlers lived in cottages, in John

 one of the lucky survivors, living a long and pros-
 perous life and leaving at his death in 1716 an
 estate of 5,500 acres. His home plantation he gave
 in life interest to his wife. Samuel received six large
 tracts of land including a quarter called Holland's
 Hills (later corrupted to its present name, Holly
 Hill) on which a modest, one-story, two-bay, un-
 painted clapboard house was built in 1698,
 perhaps for an overseer or Samuel himself, who
 was then nineteen. It was enlarged in 1713 by the
 addition of another room, a loft, a lean-to, and a
 brick chimney.143 Whether or not its frame stood
 on earthfast posts, the house conformed in all
 other respects to the usual manner of building
 among tobacco planters in the region. But the
 Harrisons' circumstances were most unusual, and
 as soon as his inheritance was assured, Samuel set

 than a fine sense of expediency typical of people
 who found themselves in that special state of in-
 cipient economic growth that we have called home-
 steading. Homesteaders quickly learned that they
 must allocate time, energy, and resources to those
 activities that would contribute soonest to making a
 living. Once they had developed a fairly reliable
 livelihood and reestablished a self-sustaining fam-
 ily and community life, most of them expected as a
 matter of course to fence fields, plant orchards,
 breed livestock, raise barns, and build houses for
 the longer term. For some, we have suggested,
 those aspirations did not rule out such well-built,
 earthfast structures as Cedar Park, at least not in
 the seventeenth century. But if we are to take con-
 temporaries at their word, there were always those
 who saw the practical advantage of buildings able
 to last many years without major repairs. A house
 or barn whose sills were raised off the ground on
 masonry foundations enhanced the value of a
 man's estate, thereby bringing a higher sale price
 or endowing his heirs with a richer patrimony. The
 desire to confer the wealth of one generation on
 selected beneficiaries of the next was a time-

 about rebuilding Holly Hill. The former cottage he
 enclosed with brick walls. He built a handsome new

 honored custom among country folk in England
 and much of western Europe.141 If that impulse
 was intensified by the greater commitment parents
 were beginning to make to the upbringing and
 future prospects of their children, as some social
 historians believe, it perhaps is true after all that
 the decline of impermanent architecture owed
 something to the rise of what has been called "af-
 fective individualism."142 But that seems to stretch

 a point. Compared to the fashionable appearance
 that a house might exhibit to those with educated
 tastes or the convenience that its plan might afford
 a family that had learned to value privacy, the
 mere fact that it stood on continuous sills or was

 made entirely of brick had little social significance.
 Its real value was something an appraiser or a tax
 assessor could put a figure on, a monetary value.
 Its psychological value was the feeling of pride and
 accomplishment it must have engendered in men
 and women who had succeeded in overcoming the
 obstacles inherent in homesteading.

 Few, if any, house-proud Chesapeake planters
 put into words that sense of achievement. One,
 Samuel Harrison of Anne Arundel County, left
 another kind of statement. His father had been

 addition, also of brick, containing a fine large par-
 lor, a generous stair hall, a dining room with a
 built-in "bowfat" for his china, and two upstairs
 chambers, the one over the parlor paneled and
 marbleized in hues of red, green, and cream. He
 retrimmed and repainted the old house through-
 out. When he was finished, he hired a limner to
 paint and frame a large wooden panel that still
 hangs above the parlor fireplace (fig. 14).144 It
 depicts-platlike-the broad acres he inherited
 from his father and that his descendants would

 continue farming for three generations. Down the
 right-hand margin are inscribed its precise metes
 and bounds. In the lower left-hand corner is a

 formal portrait of the house he had just improved
 (fig. 15). And across the top in block capitals (lest
 someone miss the point) is emblazoned the legend
 SAMUEL HARRISON'S LAND. The Harrisons

 had crossed the vernacular threshold. By a combi-
 nation of prudence, longevity, and good timing the
 immigrant homesteader had waxed rich, weath-
 ered the depression, and stubbornly refused to die
 until the very year that tobacco prices began im-
 proving. His American-born son inherited an op-
 portunity that the father had worked a lifetime for
 and provided the means to achieve. The son ac-
 complished the rest. It was the way founding a
 family in the American colonies was supposed to
 happen but in the South so seldom did.

 dwelling, but heavy plowing has removed up to a
 foot of original stratigraphy including all evidence
 of hearths. Posthole patterns suggesting hole-set
 chimney frames have allowed archaeologists to
 speculate which buildings were houses.

 1. LITTLETOWN QUARTER, KINGSMILL,
 James City County, Virginia (44JC 35). Salvage ex-
 cavations carried out in 1972-75 by Virginia His-
 toric Landmarks Commission explored four
 seventeenth-century habitation sites along the
 north side of James River four miles below Wil-
 liamsburg on land patented beginning about
 1620.146 Their investigation has brought to light a
 variety of earthfast timber-building techniques, es-
 pecially those employing hole-set uprights.

 One of the earliest is Littletown Quarter (oc-
 cupied circa 1625-50), a four-bay house, 41 by 18
 feet, erected on five pairs of hole-set posts (see fig.
 6). The building stood long enough to need repairs
 to the southeast corner posts.

 Near the center of the structure a smaller con-

 Tenement I was raised on seven pairs of
 earthfast posts arranged in four, lo-foot bays with
 half bays at each end (see fig. 6). The latter have
 been interpreted as smoke bays or chimney hoods
 rather than sheds, because it is supposed that three
 smaller postholes at the extreme northwest end of
 the building held footings for a lean-to or open
 porch. Actually, neither they nor any other exca-
 vated feature rule out the possibility that the
 structure was a 43-foot farm or storage building
 with shedded ends. Clearly it had no structural
 sills, for its most unusual feature, stud molds along
 the curtain walls, indicate that three or four 6-inch
 uprights were driven into the ground between
 each pair of posts and probably nailed to the plates
 overhead. Such being the case, it is likely that the
 building had an earthen floor.

 figuration of nine post molds, describing a rectan-
 gle 16 feet 6 inches by 12 feet 6 inches, was first
 thought to be the remains of a timber chimney or
 scaffolding for a chimney. After the discovery of
 several strikingly similar structures on the Gover-
 nor's Land farther up the James (Appendix
 2:14,15), it seemed more likely that the hole-set
 building at Littletown Quarter replaced a still ear-
 lier structure raised on puncheons, which were not
 set, but driven into the ground, hence the absence
 of postholes.

 Tenement II (see fig. 6) employed two
 technologies: hole-set posts for a four-bay, 40-by-
 18-foot core structure and uprights standing on
 trench-laid sills for a central porch to feet square
 and a 25-foot shed across the rear. The large post-
 holes, decidedly rectangular in plan and oriented
 to the long axis of the building, suggest reverse
 assembly in tie-beam pairs, a supposition
 strengthened by the fact that the post molds along
 each side are somewhat out of line. Smaller post-
 holes centered on the gables have been interpreted
 as supports for timber chimneys, but that is only an
 inference based on a similar configuration of posts
 at Utopia Leasehold (discussed below). The
 trench-laid features adjoining the main range are
 believed to have been footings for a porch and a
 shed, not remains of a wattle-fence enclosure, be-

 Three nearby structures are assumed to have
 been outbuildings. One, a three-bay, 18-by-3o-foot
 building, was part of the same range as Tenement
 II, but how they may have served each other is
 unknown. Another, 50 feet to the north and west,
 appears from the wider spacing of its central bay to
 have been a barn. The smallest structure on the

 site, a two-bay building east of the barn, enclosed
 three shallow pits intended perhaps for roots or
 seed storage. As in the case of Tenement II inter-
 mediate posts were centered on each gable, but in
 so small a building it is difficult to interpret them as
 evidence for chimney frames.

 Domestic refuse and household artifacts of ex-

 ceptional quality, all recovered from trash pits lo-
 cated in the yard adjacent to the first and second
 tenements, date principal occupation of the site to
 the second quarter of the century. The small, two-
 bay structure may have continued in use into the
 period represented by a late seventeenth-century
 pipe bowl found in one of the storage pits.

 3. LITTLETOWN (PETTUS) PLANTATION,
 KINGSMILL, James City County, Virginia
 (44JC 33). The largest, most extensive group
 of structures found at Kingsmill is believed to
 have been built by Col. Thomas Pettus sometime
 shortly after 1641 (see fig. 9). Altered and enlarged
 by him and his heirs over a period of nearly fifty
 years, its various structures are not easily arranged
 into a neat sequence of building periods. The main
 block, a five-bay structure, 50 by 18 feet overall,
 was raised on twelve 1 o-inch dressed posts set up in
 large, flat-bottomed postholes 3 feet 6 inches
 square and aligned regularly enough to suggest as-
 sembly in sidewall units. The studs may have been
 fastened to interrupted sills laid in shallow
 trenches, traces of which were observed at the west

 end and along the north side (these may also have
 been drainage trenches). A rectangular patch of
 soft brickbats located inside the north wall line and

 within the central bay was all that remained of what
 may once have been a foundation for an axial
 chimney.

 Perpendicular to the main block and possibly
 attached to its north wall was a three-bay structure,
 30 by 18 feet, heated by a large, exterior brick
 chimney at the far end. The building replaced two
 successively earlier structures in the same location,
 both predecessors being, however, only two bays
 long and, therefore, freestanding outbuildings to
 the 50-foot structure, which is presumed to have
 been the principal dwelling house. The first out-
 building and the house must have been original
 and contemporaneous; the fill in their post molds
 contained either no artifacts or only prehistoric
 materials (four pottery fragments). The two-bay
 building-a kitchen perhaps-was repaired in the
 third quarter of the seventeenth century (dated by
 pipestems in the backfill) and then entirely re-
 posted and attached to the main building.

 Besides the house and ell, another structure, 32
 by 22 feet, standing at right angles to the east end
 of the dwelling, may have been a connecting wing
 if the four small postholes between the two sections
 were footings for a link rather than supports for an

 open porch. The wing itself was a three-bay build-
 ing with a brick chimney raised against the south
 gable. Sometime after construction a brick-lined
 half cellar was excavated underneath the north

 end. The only datable artifact associated with the
 structure, a circa 162o-50 wine glass fragment
 found in the cellar builder's trench, is no help in
 narrowing down a date range for construction
 from the second quarter of the century to some-
 time immediately prior to the building's destruc-
 tion by fire, circa 168o-1700. Debris from the fire
 contained an ornamental casement window pre-
 sumably from the structure overhead or the
 adjacent house.

 A further addition to the main block was a
 hole-set posted shed tucked behind the house
 alongside the ell, apparently to shelter a dairy or a
 cooler. A shallow, tiled cistern, 13 feet 9 inches
 long by 3 feet 8 inches wide, with a bottom sloped
 toward a drain at the north end, seems a likely
 design for a tank in which to stand milk pans and
 butter pots.

 The dairy and the structure it adjoined (a
 kitchen conceivably) formed the west side of a ser-
 vice yard defined to the north by a well and to
 the east by a range of three more hole-set out-
 buildings-a two-bay structure of undetermined
 function (perhaps a quarter or work house),
 a o-foot-square poultry house possibly (suggested
 by the marl yard enclosed by a drainage or water-
 collection ditch), and an 8-by-9-foot smokehouse
 with a 5-foot-6-inch-square brick firebox inside.

 Debris from the cellar, the well, and the dairy
 cistern indicates that the farmstead eventually
 burned down but after it had been abandoned,
 probably following its purchase in 1700 by James
 Bray II. The farmhouse he immediately set about
 building nearby was brick, but his kitchens and
 outbuildings were still hole-set posted structures.

 4. UTOPIA LEASEHOLD, KINGSMILL, James
 City County, Virginia (44JC 32). A small but well-
 appointed dwelling (see fig. 9), a half mile east of
 the Littletown plantation house on property that
 the Pettuses owned and used for grazing cattle, was
 built about 1660 and occupied until 1710 or so. It
 was a three-bay, 29-by-18-foot structure whose
 carefully aligned, 11-inch dressed posts and
 square, flat-bottomed postholes invite comparison
 with similar features associated with buildings at
 the Pettus farmstead. A brick-lined half cellar, its
 walls laid in English bond, was entered from a
 bulkhead on the west gable. The house apparently

 chimneys raised against the gables. Their fireboxes
 were lined with daub, fragments of which were

 west and probably a pented closet on the east.

 of the enclosure near the gate. Its east end abuts

 to a wharf. The long north and south walls are
 delineated by rows of closely set, irregularly

 holes are so shallow-4 to 8 inches-that traces of

 plantation have brought to light a group of twelve
 early seventeenth-century buildings on land pat-
 ented in 1619 by Sir George Yeardley, governor
 and captain general of Virginia.148 On receiving
 the grant, Yeardley apparently set to work at once
 building a palisade across the neck of land on
 which the settlement was sited and behind it con-

 structed no fewer than twelve dwellings, three
 storehouses, and four tobacco houses reported to
 be standing in 1624/25.149

 Archaeologists may have located at least one of

 the warehouses inside a fortified or fenced enclo-

 sure approximately 240 by 1 1o feet, fronting on

 between. All six are about 3 feet square, as are two
 more located halfway along each sidewall. Four of
 these larger holes contain post molds that are
 roughly squared, about 12 inches on a side and
 approximately 1 foot deep.

 If the three large postholes are correctly inter-
 preted as framed gables, the length of the building
 was 32 feet with 5 feet left over at each end for
 lean-to sheds lightly constructed of hole-set pun-
 cheons. Interpreted another way, the shallow pits
 at the extreme ends of the building might also have
 been footings for timber chimneys, in which case
 the structure would more likely have been a dwell-
 ing. However, having found no hearths or burned
 subsoil, archaeologists favor its interpretation as a
 shedded warehouse entered from a loading plat-
 form at the northeast corner of the structure

 through a doorway represented by a 5-foot gap in
 the row of smaller postholes.

 The most unusual feature of the building, its
 16-foot bays between major structural uprights, in-
 vites speculation that the hole-set studs in the
 sidewalls served in the manner of puncheons to
 support the long lengths of plate that bore the
 weight of the roof. Certainly a building so spar-
 ingly framed obscures any useful distinction be-
 tween hole-set studs and what early Virginians
 termed "punches sett into the Ground" to the point
 that there could be argued a logical connection
 between earthfast studs and closely set driven
 posts.

 Although the postholes and post molds con-
 tained no artifacts that date the construction or

 6. STONE HOUSE FOUNDATION, FLOWER-
 DEW HUNDRED, Prince George County, Vir-
 ginia (44PG 64). Seven hundred feet west of the
 enclosed area described above the foundations of a

 contemporaneous structure have been found, this
 one almost certainly a dwelling (see fig. 7). Exca-
 vated completely, the house is part of a larger, un-
 explored domestic complex.

 Stone footings enclose a rectangular area 41 by

 24 feet with an 8-by-1 o-foot projection slightly off
 center on the north side toward the river. Inside, a
 cobblestone foundation underpins the brick and
 brickbat remains of a 9-by-lo-foot, H-shaped
 chimney. Both fireboxes are 5 feet wide.

 The position of the chimney toward the west

 end of the building lines up with narrow gaps in
 the foundation walls, which, taken together,
 suggest a building of four bays. Rooms can be ar-
 ranged conjecturally into a familiar English plan by
 placing a heated parlor in the westernmost bay, the
 chimneystack and perhaps an entrance lobby in the
 narrow one next to it, a hall in the central, widest
 bay, and one or two unheated service rooms at the
 eastern "lower" end of the building. The project-
 ing ell would thereby have opened off the hall and
 may have accommodated either a staircase or pos-
 sibly another small room. Soil stains indicate that
 additional rooms or sheds where later built against
 the north and east sides of the house.

 A low stone foundation, built in a shallow con-
 struction trench, underpinned the house frame.
 Building stones of any sort are rarely found on
 seventeenth-century sites in the tidewater region.
 These in Flowerdew Hundred are irregular to
 squarish slabs of siltstone, roughly dressed on all
 surfaces. There are seventy major stones
 altogether; the largest measures 2 feet 5 inches by
 1 foot to inches by 5 inches. Barnacles adhere to
 some; others are discolored by either burning or
 natural oxidation, which occurred before the

 sion of earthfast building techniques are the gaps
 regularly spaced along the foundations into which
 upright timbers once were fitted. The stonework is
 interrupted at the four corners of the main block,
 at the outer corners of the projecting ell (an area
 disturbed by plowing), once each in the middle of
 the short east and west walls, and at such regular
 intervals along the sidewalls as suggests a lo-, 8-,
 12-, and to-foot bay system. In all, the foundation
 wall is interrupted fourteen times. The corner
 spaces are uniformly broad (3 by 2 feet); those
 along the walls somewhat narrower. Some of the
 stones bear traces of mortar on the faces adjoining
 the gaps. In one a brick mortared to an adjacent
 stone shows that the builders gave careful attention
 to the exact size of the openings.

 Shallow rectangular depressions were exca-
 vated inside several gaps, conspicuously those at
 the corners. The largest of these features measures
 2 feet to inches by 1 foot 5 inches by 6 inches. Each
 extends to a depth equal to or slightly lower than
 the base of the foundation stones (about 1 foot
 below original grade) and was filled with destruc-
 tion debris consisting of pieces of finished plaster,
 charcoal, burned soil, and so forth. The marks are
 thought to have been created by pressure from a
 frame of heavy uprights standing directly in the
 shallow builder's trench.

 The archaeological evidence suggests con-
 struction in the following sequence: (1) excavation
 of the builder's trench, (2) construction of the
 stone foundation wall in the trench, dirt packed
 under some stones leveling the wall surface for a
 topping of brickwork, (3) erection of the timber
 frame, probably including installation of inter-
 rupted sills between the uprights, (4) heightening
 the footings to the level of the sills with at least two
 courses of brickwork, and (5) backfilling the
 trench. The ground-standing frame lasted twenty

 or thirty years before its destruction before 1650o.

 7. MIDDLE PLANTATION, Anne Arundel
 County, Maryland (18AN 46). No site better illus-
 trates the varied and extensive use that planters
 made of earthfast building techniques or the lon-
 gevity of those techniques on farmsteads that de-
 clined in social status. In this case a merchant-

 came a tenement after about 1710. The excava-
 tion of Middle Plantation, 9 miles west of present-
 day Annapolis, brought to light the remains of
 twenty-two buildings, some framed on hole-set
 posts and others box-framed on earthfast blocks
 (see fig. 10).151 A probate inventory of 1694 in-
 dicates that there were other structures standing
 then for which there is no archaeological evidence,
 probably because they were set on shallow brick
 footings or on trench-laid sills eradicated by later
 plow disturbance. That loss is partly compensated
 by the site's numerous subsurface storage pits and
 cellars, some of which were a form of im-
 permanent vernacular building never encountered
 by architectural historians and seldom by ar-
 chaeologists.

 carpentry work as well as box framing raised on
 earthfast blocks. A separate milk house and a shed
 attached to the east end of Duvall's dwelling are
 presumed (from the uniform basal elevations of
 the postholes) to have been hole-set structures; so
 too were several tiny coolers, disposable buildings
 (discussed below) that were simply pulled down
 and replaced whenever their timber footings de-
 cayed. The most easily interpreted evidence for
 posts in the ground are the holes and molds as-
 sociated with the circa 1700 kitchen, a two-bay
 building northeast of the house. Its mostly rect-
 angular construction holes were all dug to the same
 depth; impressions of dressed timbers are all lo-
 cated against the north side of the holes, persuasive
 evidence that the walls were raised as preassembled
 frames. Before being placed in the ground, the
 butt of each post had been deliberately charred to
 preserve it from decay.

 dles a ridge between the Patuxent and South riv-
 ers. There Duvall built his dwelling plantation on a
 small headland overlooking a spring.

 reen Duvall patented Middle Plantation in 1664.

 A Huguenot emigre, Duvall first appears in the
 Maryland records in 1659, when, having served
 out his indenture, he exercised his right to fifty
 acres of land. Within twenty-five years he rose
 from the status of carpenter to that of merchant-
 planter. At his death in 1694, he left his children
 and third wife 2,856 acres and credits and move-
 ables worth ?L1,400.

 The two-bay building thought to have been the
 newer quarter (located southeast of the spring) can
 only have been a box-framed structure raised off
 the ground on hole-set blocks, for the timber
 molds vary in depth and are curiously paired at the
 corners, both features unfamiliar in post-in-the-
 ground construction. Blocks may also have sup-
 ported the very similar structure west of the house
 lot, the first quarter conceivably.

 Duvall's probate inventory mentions several

 buildings: a dwelling and kitchen, a milk house, a
 quarter, and a new storehouse. The old storehouse
 was probably still standing too, and the inventory
 implies the presence of several tobacco houses on
 the home plantation. Excavations also revealed a
 root cellar, three coolers, several latrines, a hen
 house possibly, and three buildings that probably
 were constructed soon after Duvall's death-a sec-

 ond quarter, a new kitchen, and a new root cellar.

 Neither Duvall's dwelling, kitchen, or
 storehouses left an identifiable timber mold pat-
 tern, but the location of the house is indicated by a
 subfloor pit and an adjacent area of brick rubble.
 Bracketing features--a fence line to the west and a
 small structure to the east-suggest that the dwell-
 ing measured about 42 by 20 feet, enclosing three
 rooms listed in the inventory, a hall, a middle

 The eighteenth-century plantation (see fig. 12). A de-
 cade or two after Duvall's death, the plantation be-
 came a tenement. His heir, Lewis Duvall, was ab-
 sent from the province in 1710o and resided per-
 manently in South Carolina by 1718. Nevertheless,
 the Duvalls owned Middle Plantation until 1763-
 Their tenants maintained the structures poorly.
 The dwelling house had to be replaced by about
 1720, and both quarters had been abandoned (one
 was entirely rebuilt) ten years later. Only the (con-
 jectured) kitchen remained, reused perhaps as a
 work house or a slave quarter. The new buildings
 were numerous, especially for a tenement, but all,
 save one, were cheaply built earthfast structures.
 They lasted less time than the seventeenth-century
 buildings.

 meat house possibly-were grouped around a
 forecourt enclosed by a wattle fence, the home lot
 now having turned ninety degrees to face west to-
 ward a road. To the north another fence enclosed

 a garden or service yard between these buildings
 and what had been the kitchen of circa 1700. A
 covered cellar was built directly behind the house,
 and beyond it a new structure of unknown
 purpose-perhaps another quarter-was erected.
 A tobacco field and drying houses replaced the old
 garden west of the home lot.

 The tenant responsible for rebuilding the plan-
 tation apparently moved away after exhausting
 the best tobacco ground, for the home lot became
 smaller as the cellar, the quarter or work house,
 and the new east quarter fell into disuse and were
 demolished after about 1740. The house and out-
 buildings around the wattled courtyard lasted until
 about 1760 when they too were abandoned after a
 life span of about forty years.

 While most of the eighteenth-century buildings

 were earthfast structures, it is often difficult to tell
 which were raised on posts in the ground and
 which on hole-set blocks. The two tobacco houses
 preserve the clearest evidence. The westernmost
 structure employed five pairs of posts set up in
 construction holes of uniform depth. Six uprights
 were dressed along their full length whereas the
 feet of the other four were left round and only
 hewn square above grade as was indicated by cir-
 cular post-mold imprints at the bottom of the
 holes, which in one case became a square impres-
 sion just below the plow zone. Clubfooted posts
 may have been that much more resistant to decay.
 The second drying barn, also four bays long,

 left a pattern of timber molds that vary consid-
 erably one from another in size, cross section, basal
 elevation (by over a foot), and spacing. Three extra
 molds fall between those marking the bay intervals.
 Their placement suggests not door posts but blocks
 inserted under sagging sills.

 Cellars, pits, and coolers. Throughout most of its
 history Middle Plantation afforded its farmers a
 range of subsurface storage facilities so varied in
 size and character that they must have served dif-
 ferent uses. Eleven or twelve in all, they fall into
 four categories-full cellars, shallow subfloor pits
 under major buildings, separately roofed root cel-
 lars, and one small, brick-lined cooling pit. There
 were at least two types in use at any one time.

 Full cellars under both quarters were walled

 with split puncheons driven into the floor and
 lined on the inside with 1-inch plank. Afterward
 the floors were surfaced with packed clay. The east

 cellar (circa 1670) was fitted with raised platforms
 along both sides of a central aisle, the surviving
 sleepers showing that the platforms were wide
 enough to hold rows of wooden casks. The south
 cellar (circa 1700), perhaps superseding the earlier
 one, which was prone to flooding, may have been
 partitioned and partly floored with plank; one
 corner was surfaced with brick rubble. Such large
 cellars were intended for the storage of casked
 foodstuffs, salted meat perhaps but more likely
 fermented cider. A visitor to the region in 1702
 noted the importance of cool cider cellars: "As the
 common man does not have good cellars, this
 drink cannot be kept during the summer, but turns
 sour."152 Duvall's 1694 inventory lists "17 old cider
 casks" in his quarter.

 In contrast to the cellars with headroom were

 several subfloor storage pits-shallow, rectangular,
 unlined holes beneath the seventeenth- and
 eighteenth-century dwellings. Too small for stor-
 ing casked goods, they were well suited to keep
 dairy products cool in summer and fruit and roots
 from freezing during winter. Robert Beverley ob-
 served in 1705 that it was necessary to bury seed
 potatoes "under Ground, near the Fire-Hearth, all
 the Winter ... for the least Frost coming at them
 rots and destroys them." Similarly in 1770 Landon
 Carter's overseer searched the "holes and boxes"

 under the slaves' cabins for a stolen butter pot.153

 In size halfway between full cellars and subfloor
 pits were four small cellar outbuildings. One stood
 in the seventeenth-century garden, a second was
 located immediately behind the new kitchen, and a
 third and fourth were convenient to the southeast

 end of the eighteenth-century dwelling. Two were
 crudely built, unlined pits that occupied most of
 the floor space in the post-in-the-ground structures
 that covered them. Loose planks were probably
 laid over the holes so that the upper parts of the
 structures could be put to other uses. The root
 cellar in the garden was different. Its four hole-set
 posts stood directly in the corners of the excavated

 pit, were enclosed with 2-inch plank, and probably
 supported a low roof. A similar, perhaps ground-
 laid roof must have covered the cellar pit east of
 the eighteenth-century house complex. That one
 was entered down a short flight of dirt steps. Both

 seem to have resembled a later cellar structure still

 used on the farm in 1923.154 Excavated at a depth
 of approximately 4 feet, it was 6 by 8 feet and
 was posted at the four corners, planked around
 the outside, and roofed with weatherboards. Dirt

 steps provided access to the root crops stored there.
 Butter, milk, and cream were kept cool in two
 kinds of outbuildings at Middle Plantation--dairies
 and "coolers." The structure north of Duvall's

 dwelling was apparently the "milk house" referred
 to in his inventory. It contained a shallow and un-
 usually small, 2-by-2-foot brick-lined pit. The
 shortage of dairy equipment and storage vessels
 itemized in the inventory (one churn and two but-
 ter pots) or excavated in the vicinity of the milk
 house suggests that the building was used less for
 storage and more as a work room, the small cooling
 pit intended perhaps only for dairy products in
 daily use. Bulk storage seems to have been con-
 signed to the coolers standing near the spring and
 farther east along the stream's edge where sherds
 of numerous milk pans and butter pots were
 found. Coolers were small, framed boxes, roofed
 and sided with clapboards and elevated on hole-set
 stilts. Food, especially milk, was passed through a
 door in one side and placed on the shelves that
 lined the interior. The milk house and coolers at

 Middle Plantation are associated with Duvall's res-

 idency. The later tenants' dairying activities cannot
 be located with certainty, the small structure along
 the south fence line being the only likely milk
 house.

 member, and the colony's chief administrative and
 financial officer. His house, like Gov. Leonard Cal-

 vert's nearby, served as a public meeting place for
 the assembly and provincial court until Lewger's
 departure in 1645. His son followed him at St.
 John's; then a planter, Henry Fox, in 1650; three
 years later merchant Simon Overzee; and finally
 Gov. Charles Calvert, who lived there from 1662 to
 1667. Thereafter, the Calverts leased it to a succes-
 sion of innkeepers. The buildings collapsed or
 were pulled down by 172o. By then the dwelling,
 its yards, and surrounding outbuildings under-
 went many alterations, which can be reconstructed
 from archaeological evidence and two sets of
 documents: a series of lawsuits from the residence

 of Overzee 1653-60, and a 1678 lease with an an-
 nexed list of "Reparations and other things to be
 made and done at the Manner house and Lands of

 St. John's."1155

 As first built the house was a fully framed, five-
 bay building, 52 feet long by 20 feet 6 inches wide,
 its sills underpinned with continuous cobblestone
 footings (see fig. 2). The main, central entrance
 opened into a narrow lobby against a timber chim-
 ney shaft set on back-to-back brick fireboxes.
 These heated two ground-floor rooms-an ample
 kitchen to the west and opposite it an even larger
 undivided parlor, presumably the room in which
 Lewger held public meetings.156 There was a closet
 alongside the fireplace in the parlor, probably
 tucked under an enclosed staircase that ascended
 from the kitchen to chambers in the loft overhead.

 8. ST. JOHN'S, ST. MARY'S CITY, St. Mary's
 County, Maryland (18ST 1-23). Archaeologists
 exploring a site known as St. John's adjoining the
 early Maryland settlement at St. Mary's City have
 found the remains of a fairly substantial dwelling,
 which, notwithstanding its box frame and low
 cobblestone foundations, was floored with boards

 The house was probably only one story high,
 covered-both roof and walls-with riven clap-
 boards, floored and plastered within, the windows
 glazed, and a stone-walled cellar located under half
 the parlor.157 By and large the house was well built,
 a product of the English housing revolution in a
 place where durable dwellings were a prerequisite
 few could afford.

 nailed to joists that the builders laid directly on the
 ground. St. John's not only shows that there were
 many intermediate steps on the way from perish-
 able to permanent buildings, but its complicated
 later history of repairs and additions using a
 technology of hole-set construction is a reminder
 that those steps were not always progressive im-
 provements.

 John Lewger built the house in 1638. A former

 Anglican clergyman from Somerset, he was com-
 missioned by Lord Baltimore as a judge, a council

 Wheeler Stone, "St. John's Archaeological Questions and An-
 swers," Maryland Historical Magazine 69, no. 2 (Summer 1974):

 Homelot on the Seventeenth-Century Chesapeake Tidewater

 against an inner room, for the artifacts scattered outside this
 doorway contained parlor, not service-room, materials; see

 Subsequent alterations and additions to St.

 John's failed to maintain the same standard. A small
 subterranean dairy or cool room, which an early
 owner attached shedlike to the north side of the

 kitchen after the house was built, was raised on a
 pair of hole-set posts. Wooden steps led down from
 the kitchen into a plank-lined pit paved with cob-
 bles. Nearby to the northeast, the two-bay box
 frame of an early quarter or storehouse (19 by 15
 feet) stood on low blocks planted only 2 feet deep
 and irregularly spaced. The windows were glazed,
 but, since no fragments of wall plaster were re-
 covered, it stands to reason that the walls were left
 unfinished inside or else were boarded; we know
 they were whitewashed sometime before 1678.
 The floor was earth or laid with loose planks.

 The dairy shed was short-lived. Overzee de-
 molished it and built a separate milk house. He also
 converted the outbuilding behind the parlor into a
 kitchen. By removing the cooking activities (as well
 as the cooks) from the house, the kitchen became a
 hall and the house as a whole was less frequented
 by Overzee's servants and slaves.

 in 1678, this time in preparation for renewing the
 lease (see fig. 2B). The terms required the
 leaseholder to repair the foundations under the
 great house, underpin the nursery with brick,
 patch the fireplaces, and rebuild the staircases if
 need be. The house was to be pantiled, and a two-
 story porch added to the front. Five outbuildings
 needed repair, the kitchen, the quarter near the
 gate, a house next to the pasture, a stable, and a
 hen house in the orchard. The lessee was also obli-

 gated to build a new oven with a "shade" over top
 and fence the garden with clapboard pales. Much
 of the work was executed, some of it more ambi-
 tiously than the specifications called for. The
 workman pulled down the old brick and timber
 chimney in the great house and built another in
 Flemish bond against the rear wall, thereby en-
 larging the lobby presumably for a staircase that
 was no longer wanted in the former kitchen, now a
 more private hall. The cellar under the parlor was
 repaired, and its floor paved with brick, but there is
 no evidence that the nursery was underpinned. In-
 stead, a wooden block was inserted under the

 room-later termed the "Room called the

 Excavations inside the main dwelling yielded an

 Nursery"-was added ell fashion off the northwest
 corner of the house. Calvert also built a "little

 unusual amount of information about floor con-

 House near to the Gate" along the east side of the
 foreyard, perhaps then as later "for a Quarter."
 This three-bay, 30-by-2o-foot building was more
 likely framed on hole-set posts than raised blocks,
 because the timbers were hewn square and set to a
 roughly even depth. It seems to have been a post-
 in-the-ground structure pushed up in pre-
 assembled sidewall frames. We believe it was a

 two-unit building with centrally located front and
 rear doorways. A brick fireplace heated the south
 room. The windows were unglazed. Calvert's work
 at this time may or may not also have included
 raising the height of the main house or adding
 dormers to the roof, for subsequently it was re-
 ferred to as the "great house," a designation that
 the original story-and-loft dwelling might not have
 merited.

 Calvert again turned his attention to St. John's

 struction. The joists or sleepers to which the floor
 planks were nailed were entirely independent of
 the sills, not part of the house frame at all. The
 floor frames appear to be original. Not only is
 there no evidence of earlier earth floors, but there
 are clear signs that adding the dairy shed and
 building the 1678 chimney required modifications
 in an existing floor frame.

 Most of the original joists seem to have been
 laid in shallow slots in the topsoil. Under the
 kitchen, where much of the topsoil had been re-
 moved during construction, some of the joists
 merely rested on the ground surface where they
 were held in position by small cobblestones while
 the floor planks were nailed in place. By the
 time of the 1678 renovations, the ground level
 under the kitchen (by then the hall) had risen with
 the gradual accumulation of debris, so that, when
 two new joists were installed after the reconstruc-

 tion of the chimney, the workmen had to dig
 generous construction ditches, set the joists, and
 then carefully backfill the ditches around them.

 The kitchen and parlor floors were framed dif-

 ferently. The sleepers under the kitchen were laid
 across the width of the room. Their spacing, center
 to center, varied from 2 feet to inches to 2 feet 2
 inches. The floor may have been planked in halves,
 for there were traces of a double row of nails in the

 The squared wooden blocks that supported the
 sills left a pattern of postholes and post molds that
 recreated the steps involved in setting a box frame
 on blocks. The carpenter first marked out the four
 corners of his intended building, at which point he
 dug roughly rectangular pits. In these he set up
 lengths of waste timber and leveled their tops to a
 line. The sills were placed on these. He then exca-
 vated shallow holes along the length and the
 breadth of the building to hold the intermediate
 blocks that were snugged up under the sills to sup-
 port them as work began on the house frame itself.
 The archaeological clues to block construction
 are here unmistakable: deeply excavated corner
 holes of varied depth, smaller, shallower (by as
 much as 2 feet 3 inches) depressions for the inter-
 mediate blocks, scantling of various sizes, and,
 although not here so much as at other sites, fre-
 quent disregard for spacing in regular bays. All are
 characteristics of earthfast footings that were un-
 related to the structural frame they underpinned.

 center sleeper.

 The parlor joists ran longitudinally to take ad-

 vantage of support provided by the west cellar wall.
 Each was presumably half the length of the room,
 originating or terminating on the cellar wall. Those
 that underpinned the floor in the west half of the
 room were designed for 2-foot centers, but their
 actual positions varied considerably, perhaps to
 make room for the ends of the joists that spanned
 the cellar. Floorboards in the parlor measure ap-
 proximately 12 inches by 14 to 14/2 inches.

 Why did the builders of St. John's construct

 inferior floors when joists fully framed to the sills
 would have required only a few additional days of
 labor? The most likely explanation is that the car-
 penter thought of floors, as many of his fellow En-
 glish housewrights did, as optional extras--
 refinements for a parlor or a threshing floor-but
 not integral parts of a house or barn frame.
 Ground-and-trench-laid sleepers are known from
 Essex, and several such floors have survived in

 Maryland (AA-141). The only known hole-set
 building to last almost 300 years, Cedar Park is a
 paradox that poses a difficult question-in what
 way, besides its posts in the ground, was this

 ported the most massively framed, most expertly

 9. OUTBUILDING, GERRET VAN SWER-
 INGEN SITE, ST. MARY'S CITY, St. Mary's
 County, Maryland (18ST 1-19). Excavations along
 Aldermanbury Street in the late seventeenth-
 century village have uncovered traces of an out-
 building 21 by 18/2 feet, whose box frame was
 raised off the ground on the hole-set blocks (see
 fig. 8). Located at the back of a lot patented by
 innkeeper Gerret van Sweringen in 1672, the an-
 cillary structure was put up for him or his son
 during extensive renovations to the property, circa
 169o- 1700. Fragments of window glass, wall plas-
 ter, and the brick base of a firebox and apparent
 oven suggest that the building was used as a com-
 bination bake house and servants' quarter.

 The house (see fig. 4) was built in 1702 as a
 one-story, five-bay building with a hall and parlor
 downstairs, a porch tower centered on the east ele-
 vation, and chambers in the loft reached by a newel
 staircase alongside the chimney in the northwest
 corner of the north room.160 The chambers were

 lit by a pair of dormer windows on each slope of a
 steep gable roof. Brick chimneys, enclosed inside
 the gable ends, heated the rooms downstairs and
 perhaps also the chambers. An earth-walled cellar,
 excavated beneath the central portion of the
 house, stored root vegetables, which were tumbled
 down a paved chute running under the rear (west)
 wall. The entire house-roof, walls, and tower-
 was sheathed in oak clapboards. Those on the roof

 turned spindles like one at Bond Castle in Calvert
 County, which perhaps the owner wished to retain
 for ventilation.

 In 1736 appraisers of the estate of Richard
 Galloway II, a merchant who had owned the prop-
 erty since 169o, inventoried the house and named
 the rooms-a "Hall" (apparently the south room)
 furnished for dining and sitting, a "Parlor" used as
 a bedroom, and, upstairs, sleeping chambers over
 each, the "Hall Chamber" (farthest from the stair),
 the more private and better appointed of the
 two.161 The "Porch" and "Porch Chamber" were

 The porch too was finally swallowed up inside a
 much larger, two-story, brick and frame addition
 attached to the front circa 1825-an enormous
 projecting bay, which was later tricked out with the
 gingerbread porches that now give the whole
 building its resemblance to a beached riverboat.163
 Perhaps in the 1820os, maybe earlier, the lean-to
 was widened 3 feet and its west wall relaid in En-
 glish bond. About 1850 the interiors were re-
 trimmed in the Greek revival style, and the fenes-
 tration of the lean-to wall was altered a second

 time. More remodeling in 1962 removed a kitchen
 that had certainly been rebuilt at least once since
 the eighteenth century.

 By rights Cedar Park should have gone the way

 of other hole-set buildings. Only the brick shell and
 lean-to saved the timber frame inside, thereby pre-
 serving for our inspection the only known com-
 plete skeleton of an early post-in-the-ground
 building. The house as first built was raised in
 sidewall units one piece at a time. Each 15-16-foot
 post was reared separately and left loosely standing
 in its pit, the interrupted sills then inserted and
 pegged to the posts one at a time, the braces in-
 stalled, the studs stood in their mortises picket
 fashion, and, finally, the heavy plate raised with a
 block and tackle and lowered inch by inch onto the
 waiting tenons of the posts and studs.164 Pegs
 hammered into the joints tightened the free-
 standing frames, which were then ready to bring
 into plumb, the housewrights installing the sleep-
 ers and end sills in the process. When both walls
 were standing perfectly upright, six substantial
 tie-beams were set in place directly over the posts
 and oversailing the wall plates by a foot at each
 end. The lighter end girts were positioned first in
 order to square up the structure, followed by the
 other, larger tie-beams starting in the middle and
 working toward each end. As each was slid into
 place, nine common joists were fitted in between.
 When the carpenters reached the endmost bays,
 the common joists could not be mortised at both
 ends since the girts were already fixed, so there the
 joists were simply lapped and pegged. Presumably,

 west corner post may have lodged the end of a pole used to hold
 the post upright if in the block-and-tackling maneuver the

 places to store unwanted tools and furniture, while
 above them a "Peake Roome" was sparsely
 equipped as a sleeping loft. A separate "Kitchen"
 was probably located off the south end convenient
 to the hall. No lean-to rooms are mentioned.

 Somewhere nearby there was a "Store" where
 Galloway kept his stock of merchandise.

 The complicated history of subsequent
 alterations to the house is important to under-
 standing why the original building survived. It can
 be summarized briefly. The first addition was a
 lean-to, 9 feet wide, built on brick footings across
 the rear of the house to provide two (or possibly
 three) back rooms and two ample, 6-by-9-foot
 closets, one at each end.162 Then sometime around

 the middle of the eighteenth century one of Gallo-
 way's heirs lengthened the house (including the
 lean-to) and rebuilt the chimneys to make room for
 a central passage large enough to accommodate a
 generous flight of stairs. The old timber-framed
 structure was faced with a new brick skin laid in the

 all-header bond then fashionable in nearby An-
 napolis. In the course of that work the bricklayers
 underpinned the sills. A frame kitchen was erected
 against the south gable to share the new chimney
 stack with the dining room. Four new,
 pedimented, dormer windows, whitewashed over a
 coat of Spanish brown, replaced the older, nar-
 rower dormers on the east slope of the roof. The
 roof itself was recovered with more round-butt

 shingles. A brick cocoon now entirely enveloped
 the old timber-framed house, all except-oddly
 enough-the clapboarded porch tower. It may
 have been an open porch with a grillwork of

 n61 Liber 30, folios 384-91, Anne Arundel County In-

 ventories, Hall of Records, Annapolis.

 162 Dating the lean-to is a problem. It followed the construc-
 tion of the house soon enough to perfectly preserve the hole-set
 posts along the west wall, yet the 1736 inventory makes no
 mention of it. Apparently the posts survived forty years un-
 touched by decay. The number of rooms in the early lean-to is
 suggested by one original and one later door post framed into
 the west wall plate and sills. The closets are indicated by plaster
 stains on the plate and corner posts.

 the postholes were backfilled either immediately
 before or after installation of the tie-beams, prob-
 ably afterward when the frame was at last as rigid
 as the builders could make it.

 The six principal rafters of the roof frame were

 erected next, according to the carpenters' marks,
 from north to south, from "I" to "VI." As each was

 raised, it was coupled to its neighbor with two pairs
 of butt purlins. Wind-braces strengthened the
 three central bays. Common rafters, mortised and
 tenoned at the apex, were notched over the upper
 purlins and their feet nailed to those below. The
 lower purlins were mounted not on the rake of the
 roof, but level, so that the common rafters could be

 carried at a gentler pitch to the eaves on short ad-
 ditional pieces nailed to the purlins and standing
 on the false plates. This produced flared eaves well
 forward of the principal rafters, which were let
 into the tie-beams directly over the posts, thus
 making a compact post-and-truss unit. The false
 plates lay along the upper ends of the tie-beams
 and were further supported by short spurs run-
 ning out from the nearest common joists, over top
 the wall plates, and into notches underneath the
 false plates. The roof trusses stood without re-
 inforcement from structural collar beams; those

 provided were merely edge nailed to the purlins to
 carry the lath and plaster ceilings of the attic
 chambers.

 The frame at Cedar Park, especially the roof
 frame, is remarkably well built as buildings go in
 the Chesapeake region. The dimensions of the
 scantling exceed that of most other structures,
 and its carpentry joints exhibit a degree of sophis-
 tication unknown in other early buildings in
 Maryland and Virginia. The posts, for example,
 measure 9 by 11 or 12 inches, the interrupted sills
 7 by 9 inches, and the wall plates 8 by 91/2 inches.
 The tie-beams are 13 inches broad and 12 inches
 deep.

 principals with pegged central-tenon, housed
 shoulders, and sunken abutment-cheeks. Even the
 principal rafters were joined at the ridge with a
 soffit-shoulder to take the roof's great weight off
 their central tenons. Only the riven common raf-
 ters and the tacked-on collar beams could afford to

 be slight and waney, for they were not really part
 of the structural frame at all.

 This formidable piece of timber framing was
 raised on posts embedded 4 feet or more in
 ground that was sure to destroy them years before
 the roof and walls would need attention. Certainly
 the housewright foresaw that eventually. Timber
 for members that would come in contact with the

 ground was knowledgeably chosen for its preser-
 vation qualities: cedar for posts and sills, locust for
 sleepers (the rest of the frame is oak and poplar).
 Moreover, the 18-inch diameter post butts were
 left undressed below the sills to prolong their lives
 as much as possible (an uncommon, but not un-
 known, practice). It is unconvincing to argue that
 post-in-the-ground construction saved the car-
 penter time and Galloway money. In fact, it cost
 more to cut and fit twenty mortises and tenons for
 the interrupted sills than the twelve that proper
 ground sills would have required. That seems to
 leave only one other explanation. By the time
 Cedar Park was built, hole-set construction had be-
 come one of several equally acceptable ways of
 building in the region. Cedar Park, the timber-
 framed building, lasted a lifetime. That apparently
 satisfied this and probably many other builders'
 expectations.

 Inventory of Earthfast Buildings
 in Maryland and Virginia

 At a time and in an area where nails were fast

 replacing even simple mortise and tenon joints, the
 elaborate joinery at Cedar Park is exceptional.165
 For instance, the common joists were given a
 soffit-tenon with an oversquinted shoulder and
 diminished haunch. Each butt purlin at the collar
 level was joined to the principal rafters by a face-
 tenon and square haunch, both of reduced width,
 most with pegs. The trusses were actually held to-
 gether by the lower purlins, firmly mortised to the

 14. THE MAINE, James City County, Virginia
 probably destroyed third quarter eighteenth cen-
 (44JC 41). Tenements on this site are among the
 tury. Little is known about this small dwelling,
 earliest and least substantial earthfast structures
 which may have had a lobby entry against a timber
 chimney. Test excavated 1978 by Mary C.
 Beaudry for Southside Historical Sites. Reported
 in Mary C. Beaudry, "An Eighteenth-Century Post
 Structure (44CE 49), Caroline County, Virginia,"
 typescript, 1978, Southside Historical Sites.

 building and a separate root cellar.

 12. MOYSONEC, New Kent County, Virginia
 (44NK 32). Dwelling, 24 by 16 feet, three bays,
 hole-set posts, late seventeenth century. Excavated
 1975 by Norman F. Barka for Southside Historical
 Sites. Report in preparation.

 13. JAMESTOWN ISLAND, James City County,
 Virginia (no site no.). No early earthfast buildings
 have been found at Jamestown. Those reported
 here belong to later periods in the history of this
 colonial capital. Historical archaeology was in its
 infancy when many of the Jamestown sites were
 explored. Consequently the information is often
 incomplete. Excavated 1934-58 by National Park
 Service archaeologists. Reported in John L. Cotter,
 Archaeological Excavations at Jamestown, Virginia

 century.

 (B) Structure 71-77, dwelling, 40 by 18 feet,
 probably five bays, hole-set posts, second quarter
 seventeenth century. Probably built in two sections,
 structure 71-77 was destroyed by fire and replaced
 by structure 41.

 (C) Structure 41, dwelling, 53 by 20 feet, six

 bays, hole-set posts, late seventeenth century.

 (D) Structure 1 0O, dwelling, 21 feet 6 inches by
 20 feet 4 inches, two bays, ground-standing frame
 with interrupted sills, circa 1630-50. Converted to
 a bake house or workshop, this building was
 underpinned with brick footings that left gaps at
 the corners and along the sides for the posts of a
 ground-standing frame similar to the Stone House
 at Flowerdew Hundred (see Appendix 2:25).

 (E) Structure 45, outbuilding, 28 by 18 feet,
 three bays, hole-set posts, late seventeenth century.
 Probably a kitchen to structure 19, tentatively
 identified as the Woodhouse Inn.

 (F) Structure 116, possible dwelling 29 by 15
 feet, three bays, hole-set posts fourth quarter sev-
 enteenth century.

 (A) Dwelling, 22 by 20 feet with 4-foot shed,

 unbayed, closely set driven posts, circa 1618-25.

 (B) Probable outbuilding, 27 by to feet, un-

 bayed, driven posts, circa 1618-25-

 (C) Probable outbuilding, 17 by 16 feet, un-

 bayed, driven posts, circa 1618-25-

 (D) Dwelling, 18 by 15 feet, unbayed, closely set

 driven posts, circa 1618-25.

 15. PASBEHAY TENEMENT, James City
 County, Virginia (44JC 42). Dwelling, 20 feet 6

 Charles County Courthouse,

 A courthouse, built in 1674, enlarged eight years
 later, and extensively repaired in 1699 and 1715, is
 one of the best-described seventeenth-century
 hole-set frame structures in Maryland and the only

 the Court house Opposite to the Porch with an
 shed across the rear. The shed was partitioned into
 two rooms. The main structure had a single
 Outside Chimney and Clossett at the End of the
 said Room. . . . The New Roome not to be Framed
 ground-floor room with one chamber above and
 Worke but with Posts In the Ground of Locust
 another over the porch. A brick chimney stack at
 the north end of the building provided fireplaces
 for the lower room and the loft. The lower room

 was to be "well wainscotted, the upper roome well
 daubed & sealed with mortar white limed & sized,
 & the shead sealed & lined with riven boards." The

 house was to be finished with "all necessary & Con-
 venient doores, locks, keyes, bolts, latches, hinges,
 staircases, staires, windowes, window frames,
 Casements & glasse to be well glazed ... above &
 below." Allen agreed to keep the courthouse in
 good repair unless its foundation "shall happen to
 decay with rottonesse."166 In 1682 the building was
 lengthened to feet, and in the new space a "seat of
 judicature" was erected "with turned work as at the
 provincial court" and with "a convenient place for
 the placing of his Lordships arms."167

 Despite the building's superior finish,
 twenty-five years later it had to be completely re-
 built. At the September 1699 term the court di-
 rected that it be "new posted and new groundselled
 and all the lower floor to be made new with new

 sleepers and to be laid with new plank." They or-
 dered new exterior weatherboard and a new roof.

 The old chimney was removed and a window put
 in its place.

 The commissioners' language does not fully de-
 scribe the framing system being repaired. Post, sill,
 and sleeper are inexact terms. Yet, the fact that it
 was necessary to replace the floor completely
 suggests that the joists were ground laid rather
 than raised on sills. Likewise, insofar as both the
 1674 contract and 1699 bill of repairs deal at
 length with decay in the foundations, it seems
 likely that the building was erected on hole-set
 posts, connected perhaps by interrupted sills, but
 was not fully framed with continuous sills sup-
 ported on blocks. Allen's agreement to maintain
 the structure probably would have included re-
 blocking, since that task would have taken a car-
 penter and a couple of laborers only a day or two.
 Much more certain is the manner of building
 an addition to replace the rear shed, for the com-
 missioners were careful to specify "a Twenty Foot
 square New Roome to be made on the Backside of

 strong and Sufficiently Built." The chimney was
 frame, for the county paid to have it filled, daubed,
 and whitewashed in 1702.168 It and the adjacent
 closet appear to have been built in a half-bay shed.
 Comparable post-mold patterns have been exca-
 vated at Utopia Leasehold (see Appendix 1:4) and
 Kingsmill Tenement (see Appendix 1:2).

 The new room's hole-set timbers rotted so

 quickly as to cause suspicion that the carpenter
 substituted a softer wood for locust. In 1715 the
 commissioners directed another carpenter to "Lay"
 the addition "on blocks" and construct a new

 chimney.169

 The 1715 repairs to the addition were part of a
 second rebuilding almost as extensive as the re-
 pairs of 1699. While some of the earlier work was
 still sound, the weatherboards, doors, and shutters

 (all new in 1699) needed repair, and the clapboard
 roof-frame and all-had to be replaced. The
 1715 specifications hint that the Charles County
 commissioners were growing impatient with the
 recurrent expense and inconvenience of im-
 permanent construction. They had begun looking
 for quality shingle timber-cypress-in 1714, and
 they specified that the new roof rafters and shingle
 lath were to be sawn, not split.17o One step at a
 time-clapboards to shingles, hole-set posts to
 hole-set blocks-the Charles County courthouse
 was evolving away from its impermanent begin-
 nings.

 Addendum

 As this essay was going to press a second early house
 with a surviving hole-set frame came to light. It
 is Sotterley, St. Mary's County, Maryland (SM-7).
