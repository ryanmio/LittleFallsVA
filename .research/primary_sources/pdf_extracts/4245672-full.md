 SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BRICKMAKING AND

 TILEMAKING AT JAMESTOWN, VIRGINIA'

 by J. C. HARRINGTON

 "Here's my furnace; let none say it ill,

 For nobly it serves its turn,

 And here, the maker, with easy skill
 And prudence my bricks I burn.

 Away with the stones you have bought, rash -wight,

 For the house you have builded high
 Stands naked now to the tempest's might.

 Then come to my kiln and buy."

 From THE BRICKMAKER'S SONG2

 DOCUMENTARY evidence to the contrary, the legend persists that bricks
 were brought over to the Virginia Colony as ship ballast. But students of
 Jamestown history have long recognized that most of the bricks used in the
 Colony, even in the earliest days, were made literally on the spot.3 This
 refers, of course, to the regular sized bricks and not to the small Dutch
 bricks, presumably imported from Holland and used to some extent at
 Jamestown, particularly for cellar floors and fireplace hearths.

 It was clearly the intent of those directing the various English colonizing

 ventures that the settlements would be of a permanent nature, with living
 conditions as nearly as possible like those back in England. Brickmakers,

 lAll of Jamestown Island, with the exception of approximately 2I acres, is now a part of Colo-

 nial National Historical Park, administered by the National Park Service, United States Depart-
 ment of the Interior. The 21-acre tract, which was designated a National Historic Site in 1940,
 belongs to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, which has administered
 the tract since 1893.

 3Bruce, after reviewing the documentary evidence concerning brickmaking and the use of
 bricks in Virginia during the seventeenth century, makes the following statement: "It would ap-
 pear that all bricks used in Virginia in this century were manufactured there." Philip A. Bruce,
 Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century (New York and London, 1896), II,
 134. A very good discussion of the manufacture and use of bricks, as well as other building
 materials, is furnished by Henry C. Forman, Jamestown and St. Mary's: Buried Cities of Romance
 (Baltimore, 1938). Forman concludes: "It appears that hand-made bricks were manufactured at
 Jamestown from the first." Ibid., 83.

 limemakers, bricklayers, and other building tradesmen were among the first
 setders, both at Jamestown and at Sir Walter Raleigh's earlier settlements
 on Roanoke Island.

 The first bricks were undoubtedly used as nogging, or filler between

 structural timbers, and for chimneys, and it is probable that bricks were not

 made in any large quantities during the first few years at Jamestown.4 Even
 so, bricks were made in sufficient quantities to be exported to the Bermudas
 in i621, where they were traded for fruits, fowl, and other commodities.'
 As the Colony became better established, brick was used more extensive-
 ly, although Secretary Kemp's house, erected in I638, was possibly the first
 house at Jamestown constructed entirely of brick. It was about this same
 time that instructions were issued to Governor Wyatt that everyone having
 500 acres of land was to build a house of brick.6 A legislative order, issued
 in I662, called for the building of 32 brick houses and required that no
 more wooden houses were to be built at Jamestown.7 As might be expected,
 this order was not popular, and in I671 permission was granted to repair
 wooden houses so long as no new ones were built. The 32 new brick houses
 were certainly not built, for at the time of Bacon's Rebellion in I676,
 Jamestown was said by a contemporary writer to have "some i6 or i 8
 houses, most as is the Church built of brick."8

 There are many other documentary references to the use of bricks, both

 in houses and other structures, such as the brick fort and various public
 buildings. Probably the most notable brick structure is the church, the
 ruined tower of which is the only structure of old Jamestown remaining
 above ground.

 In addition to the scattered references to the use of brick during Vir-
 ginia's first century, there is the more concrete evidence of the many brick
 foundations excavated at Jamestown. The reasons for the extensive use
 of brick in the Virginia Colony, as well as the ways in which they were

 4Probably the first extensive use of bricks in the Virginia Colony was at the settlement of Henri-
 copolis on Farrar's Island in the James River near the present city of Richmond. There, in I6II,
 Dale laid out a town of three streets with several houses, the first stories of which were of brick
 made on the spot by brickmakers brought by Sir Thomas Gates from England.

 vey's double house, probably built about I632 and purchased by the Colony in I641 for use as
 its first state house, may well lay claim to being the first brick house at Jamestown.

 used, is an absorbing subject, but must be left for a future article, since
 we are concerned here only with the manufacture of clay building materials

 at Jamestown.

 Although the extensive use of bricks is not proof that they were locally
 made, there are several accounts relating to brickmakers practicing their
 trade at Jamestown. Brickmaking was a highly respectable trade and many
 brickmakers were men of means in the Virginia Colony.9 This is not sur-
 prising, since bricks sold for I 5 shillings per thousand in I668, although

 the price dropped to as little as 8 shillings a few years later.10

 In view of the clear evidence for the extensive manufacture and use of
 bricks at Jamestown, it is surprising that no document has been found con-
 taining an explicit reference to a brick plant in operation there. In fact,
 the writer knows of only one specific reference to a brick kiln on James-
 town Island. It is found in the patent issued in i637 to Alexander Stomer,
 "brickmaker," for a parcel of land at the western end of the Island "neare

 the brick kill."'1

 Unlike bricks, clay roofing tiles were not used extensively at Jamestown,

 in spite of the Act of I662 which required that the roofs on 32 new brick

 houses, ordered to be built at that time, were to be covered with slate or tile.'2

 In "A Perfect Description of Virginia," printed in I 649, an anonymous writer
 states that the settlers have "Lime in abundance made for their houses,
 store of Bricks made, and House and Chimnies built of Brick, and some
 Wood high and fair, covered with Shingell for Tyle, yet they have none
 that make them, wanting workmen; in that trade the Brickmakers have
 not the art to do it, it shrinketh."'3 The obvious conclusion would seem to
 be that the brickmakers at Jamestown in I649 did not have the art of mak-
 ing roofing tiles which would not shrink. However, in the same account,
 the writer lists "tyle-makers" as one of the tradesmen who "gaine much by
 their labours and arts."''4 Furthermore, it is recorded that the great hail-
 storm of I684 destroyed tile roofs at Jamestown."5 Archeological evidence
 from the excavating of several house sites at Jamestown would indicate

 that a fairly large proportion of the better houses at Jamestown, especially
 those constructed during the last half of the century, were roofed with
 either tile or slate. Against this evidence, however, is the statement in
 Robert Beverley's History, published in 1705, to the effect that very little

 tile was used in Virginia for roofing."6

 Discovery of the remains of two brick kilns in the course of archeological
 excavating at Jamestown confirms the documentary evidence for the local
 manufacture of bricks.17 In addition, these discoveries provide, for the first
 time, information concerning the technical process employed in brick-
 making in the Virginia Colony during the seventeenth century. Since
 roofing tiles were also being burned in one of the kilns, there is now proof
 that they, too, were made at Jamestown.

 Remains of the first kiln discovered at Jamestown are located near the

 ruins of William Sherwood's house in the "New Towne" section (Brick
 Kiln "A," Figure I). The kiln had been built directly on the ground, and
 consequently only fragmentary sections remain. Portions of several benches,

 each containing a few bricks, indicate that the fire chambers, or arches, were
 approximately 20 inches wide. The bricks were stacked in herringbone
 fashion, two bricks wide, between the fire chambers. This, apparently, was
 a relatively large kiln, containing at least 2 arches, with a depth of about
 i8 feet. It is possible, however, that these remains represent two adjoining

 kilns, rather than one large one. Because of the very fragmentary condition
 of the remains, little more can be said concerning this kiln.

 Remains of the second kiln, designated "Structure 102" are located on
 a triangular tract of land lying along the "Great Road"18 about 200 feet
 northeast of the old church (Brick Kiln "B," Figure I). Careful study of
 all available records prior to the excavating gave no hint that a brick kiln
 might be found in this part of the site. As mentioned earlier, there is one

 16Robert Beverley, The History and Present State of Virginia (Chapel Hill, 1947), 290.
 17A broad program of research was carried on by the National Park Service at Jamestown from

 1934 through 1941, including both archeological exploration and historical research. Only about
 one-third of the principal town area has been explored thus far, although several outlying sites
 have been excavated. Remains of the first kiln were discovered in I935 in the "Country House"
 tract. The second kiln, with which this article largely deals, is located on the grounds of the
 Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. Excavation of this ruin, made possible
 through a cooperative agreement with the Association, was carried on in 1941 under the super-
 vision of the author.

 l8From the founding of Jamestown in I607 until some time in the nineteenth century, the
 island was connected with the mainland, although at times precariously, by a narrow isthmus.
 During this entire period, the highway from Jamestown to the mainland extended from the town-
 site northward across this isthmus. It was referred to variously as the "Great Road," "Main Cart
 road," "Cartway," "Main Road," "great old Road," and "way leading toward the Mayne." Charles
 E. Hatch, Jr., "The Great Road," The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 57 (Jan-
 uary, 1949), 14-21.

 specific reference to a brick kiln on Jamestown Island, the one referred
 to in the Stomer patent. It could not conceivably be the kiln excavated in
 I94I, as the Stomer tract is nearly half a mile away.

 The structure in question is located within the 3-acre tract patented by
 Robert Beverley in i694.19 The records, in addition to locating Beverley's
 property in relation to the "Main Cart road," "Pitch and tarr Swamp," and
 adjoining property, reveal that he built a house there sometime around
 I694 and sold the property in I7I8. No mention is made of a brick kiln
 in these records, or in those pertaining to adjacent property of the same
 general period. Nor were there surface indications of any subsurface re-
 mains in this area when excavating began in the summer in I94I.20

 This particular area was selected for excavation as the first exploration
 in the grounds of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiqui-
 ties in order that key landmarks could be located as reference points for
 determining the exact position of certain land tracts and structures de-
 scribed in old land records.

 Excavations began with a test trench running east and west across the
 assumed location of the triangular Beverley tract. This first trench was
 extremely fruitful, for, in addition to locating the "great road" on the west

 side of the tract and a property line ditch bounding the east side, the trench
 went squarely over the center of the brick kiln (Figure 2). Since the
 present article is concerned only with the kiln and related features, no de-
 tailed description of other remains encountered will be given here. Briefly,

 the excavations carried on in I94I consisted mainly of preliminary explora-

 tion of the area in the south apex of the triangular Beverley tract, primarily

 by means of a series of trenches, IO feet in width, spaced at approximately

 50-foot intervals.

 As a result of this test trenching, several interesting remains were en-
 countered, none of which were fully explored, with the exception of the
 kiln. These included, in addition to those previously mentioned, two build-

 ing foundations and evidences of a third, two wells, three graves, and several

 unidentified features. By locating certain critical points on the boundary of

 the Beverley and adjoining tracts, such as ditch corners, the exact location
 of the entire Beverley tract was determined. This, in turn, established
 the location of other adjacent property referred to in seventeenth century
 land records.

 Excavation of Kiln and Related Features

 First indications of the brick kiln ruins were the side walls of the structure

 encountered in the initial io-foot exploratory trench. As usual at James-

 town, the foundation walls were first observed approximately eight to twelve
 inches below the present ground, or at the level of the deepest disturbance
 from cultivation. There were two distinct zones of cultivation; the upper

 one, about six inches thick, representing the depth of modern plowing.
 The deeper disturbance may have resulted from tobacco cultivation.

 The first trench, which crossed the structure almost at right angles,
 was carried down in order that a full cross-section could be obtained show-
 ing the stratigraphic nature of the fill within the structure.

 It was assumed when the two walls were first uncovered that this was
 a house foundation. The ruin was recognized as a brick kiln, however,
 upon discovery of layers of bricks between the walls, laid on edge without
 mortar. In addition to the bricks, flat roofing tiles were found in the kiln,
 placed there for firing along with the bricks.21 Examination of the fill

 within the structure revealed very little concerning its original appearances,
 period of use, or date of abandonment. The lower layers were composed
 almost entirely of decomposed bricks and tiles which had previously been
 stacked in the kiln preparatory to firing. Most of the tiles and bricks were
 lightly burned, while some of the tiles were entirely unburned, being soft
 and pliable when wet.

 Above this layer of crumbled, underfired or unfired bricks and tiles, was
 a deposit of mixed earth, brickbats, and miscellaneous refuse. Some very
 interesting articles were found in this upper layer, but none of them can be

 associated with the kiln. They undoubtedly were dumped in the depression

 at a later date and could have come from any part of the site. There is evi-
 dence that the kiln stood as an exposed ruin for some time before the
 above-ground portion was razed and the depression filled.

 The unfired state of some of the tiles and the lightly burned condition
 of the others, as well as the bricks, would suggest that the kiln had been
 abandoned shortly after the burning process began. A second, but less
 plausible, explanation is that the kiln had only I ,en partially readied for
 the next charge, using underfired bricks from a previous charge in the
 bottom layers. This explanation would mean that the kiln had been aban-
 doned before the last charge had been placed and the fires started. In any
 event, the abandoned kiln stood for some time in a ruined condition, most

 of the bricks eventually being carried away for other uses. Part of the front

 wall apparently collapsed some time after the kiln was abandoned, leaving
 a jumbled pile of bricks lying on top of a layer of fill outside the kiln. A
 half-inch layer of silt, obviously washed in during rains, lay directly on
 the floors of the fire chambers and over the charcoal and ashes in the arches.
 This shows that some time elapsed before the abandoned kiln was disturbed.
 After completing the first trench across the kiln, the excavation was ex-

 tended, eventually uncovering the entire structure, as well as a limited
 space around it (Figure 2). In addition, the area in front of the kiln was
 explored well beyond the edge of the present marsh, some Ioo feet to the
 north. This area, bounded on the south by the kiln, on the north by the

 211t is known that in England and other European countries bricks and clay roofing tiles were

 made by the same artisans in the same plant, and fired in the same kiln.

 marsh, on the east by the ditch marking the eastern boundary of the Beverley
 tract, and on the west by the "great road," had provided the clay used in
 making the bricks and tiles manufactured at this plant.

 The earth in this area of approximately one-third of an acre, had been
 removed to varying depths, up to three feet in some places (Figure 2). The
 remaining portion of the tract -the triangle of high ground south of the
 kiln - was occupied by other structures, probably houses and dependencies,

 as revealed in a partial excavation of that area.

 It appears, therefore, that most, if not all, of the available land within
 this particular 3-acre tract from which earth could have been secured for
 brickmaking was exploited to that end. It is estimated that roughly 825

 to 850 cubic yards of earth were removed from the pit. Assuming that some
 of this was topsoil not suitable for brickmaking, the pit would have fur-

 nished enough clay for approximately 500,ooo bricks.

 The pit had been filled in again, apparently in two operations. The

 lower deposit, averaging six inches to one foot, was mixed clay and topsoil,
 and contained relatively little cultural material. The upper fill, on the
 other hand, contained considerable more brick chips, broken glass and ce-
 ramics, and other refuse. Most of it was seventeenth century material, but
 some dated from the following century. Obviously the pit had been filled
 intentionally after the abandonment of Jamestown, and probably for the
 purpose of farming the land.

 At the north side of the pit near the edge of the marsh was discovered a
 circular excavation nearly five feet deep. Although this depression does not

 resemble the typical dug wells found in other parts of Jamestown, it would

 have contained from one to three feet of water at all times, and undoubtedly

 served as the source of water for tempering the brick clay.

 Description of Kiln Ruins, Structure 102

 Overall dimensions of the outside walls of the kiln are roughly 24? feet
 in width by i9 feet front to back. Inside dimensions are approximately 22

 by I 5 feet. The rear and two side walls average I 4 inches in thickness, while
 the front wall, pierced by five segmental arched openings, is 34 inches at
 the bottom (Figure 3). This additional thickness was required for proper
 firing, the fuel being concentrated in the front of each fire chamber. A
 similar kiln, in operation in England in I683, is described as follows:

 This Kiln we build two Bricks and a half thick, sixteen Bricks long from inside to

 inside [ i2 to I 3 feet] and 2bricks over from inside and about fourteen or fifteen foot

 high; at the botton we make two Arches three foot high, three Bricks broad, and seven
 Bricks long, that is five Bricks longer than the Wall of the Kiln, and so the sides will

 be a Brick and a half each; . 22

 This English kiln is similar in size to the Jamestown one, except for the

 width, which is dependent, of course, on the number of arches. The front

 wall of the Jamestown kiln was thicker (4 bricks as against 2?), but this
 was made up for in the English kiln by building an extension on the arches
 to provide an adequate fire chamber at the front of each opening. The
 front wall of the Jamestown kiln probably was stepped back above the arches

 to a I 4 inch wall.

 The arched openings, or fire-holes, vary in width from 20? to 23? inches
 (2? bricks), and in height from 20 to 26 inches, which is slightly smaller
 than the English kiln described above. Over the openings are single row-

 lock, segmental arches (Figure 3). The front five or six feet of each fire
 chamber contained a layer of charcoal and wood ashes, reaching a maximum

 thickness of about 4 inches near the back face of the front wall, and extend-

 ing out a few inches in front of each opening. A portion of the clay floor
 in front of each arch had been burned a deep red for a distance of a foot
 or so beyond the opening. Charcoal, ashes, and brick chips were tramped

 into the clay floor some two to three feet in front of each fire-hole.

 Three of the arches were partially closed off with bricks laid without
 mortar, from one to three courses high. It was assumed that these low
 walls served to control the air intake, just as cast iron covers were used in
 later times. It has also been suggested that they are the remnants of the

 seal that was placed over the fire-holes after firing so that the kiln would
 cool off without admitting sufficient air to damage the bricks. There is a
 third explanation, which the following contemporary account describes
 quite graphically: "[we] make the holes up with Bricks four Course high,
 to keep the Fire-Feeders shins from burning."23

 The kiln was prepared in the first place by excavating a level space in the
 side of the sloping ground the exact width of the kiln, leaving a working
 space at the front, or down-hill side. This space was kept dry by ditches
 emptying into the clay pit to the north (Figure 2).

 three or four year; but afterwards we make it with burnt bricks, which we reckon
 better, and we choose for it a dry ground, or make it so by making Dreyns round it.24

 The outer walls of the Jamestown kiln were laid direcdy on the excavated

 level area, and without any special footings. The back and side walls were
 laid against the vertical sides of the excavation. Extensive use of brickbats

 in these walls suggests that the bricks were either salvaged from other struc-

 tures or were discards from earlier operations at this plant.

 The front and rear walls were laid in regular English bond, whereas the

 side walls are quite irregular, the stretchers varying from half to whole
 bricks. Horizontal and vertical joints are about half an inch thick, or slightly
 more, and contain soft earth or clay. As has always been the practice in

 such kilns where fire-clay is not available, loam was used in place of mortar,
 since the lime would have destroyed the brickwork under the intense heat.
 One or two entrances were usually provided in the side walls of the kiln

 for placing and removing each charge, but no evidence of such openings
 was found in the underground remains of this kiln. Nor was there any
 evidence that this kiln had been "scoved," that is, plastered with clay on
 the outside. Although contemporary records do not indicate that "scoving"
 was practiced in England, the scoved kiln has been used in America rather
 generally during the past two centuries.

 The fire chambers extended straight back to the rear wall of the kiln,
 being the same width as the arches. The sun-dried bricks were stacked on
 permanent benches, or bases, between the fire chambers. Such bases of
 well-burned bricks were often used to prevent moisture rising up into the
 bottom courses of the charge and damaging these bricks before they were
 burned. The benches in this kiln were three bricks wide, the bricks laid
 on edge, end to end, and, like the walls, without mortar. The floors of the
 fire chambers were hard-packed, natural clay, bumed deep red to a depth
 of several inches. These floors were about an inch below the bottoms of
 the permanent bench bases, or roughly level with the bottom of the ex-
 terior walls. Undoubtedly, the bases were laid in a thick bed of loam or clay
 to make them uniform and level.

 On each of these bases were found from one to five layers of incompletely
 fired bricks. The bottom four layers were stacked on edge at a slight angle.
 Corbelling over the fire chambers began with the fifth layer, which, un-
 like the first four, was laid at right angles to the chambers. Each corbelled
 course overhung just half a brick, which would have formed a complete

 arch with the third course. It would appear, therefore, that the fire-chamber

 was seven bricks high, including the permanent base, or approximately
 28 inches, which is roughly the same height as the arched openings in the
 front wall. This conclusion is substantiated by the blackened and spalled
 areas on the rear wall, which reveal quite clearly the area directly exposed
 to the smoke and fire of the kiln.

 All of the roofing tiles found had apparently fallen into the fire cham-

 bers from a higher level, none being observed in place on the benches.

 Consequently, it is not possible to say how they were originally stacked in

 the kiln.

 There is no archeological evidence indicating the original height of the
 kiln. From contemporary English accounts and descriptions of other kilns
 of this type in later times, it is assumed that the kiln was between I 2 and
 I 5 feet high. The description of an English kiln, quoted earlier, gives its
 height as I4 or I 5 feet. This same account mentions that the bricks were
 stacked in the kiln 35 or 36 courses high. Thirty-six courses in the James-

 town kiln would have made it about I 3 feet high. On this basis, the kiln
 would have held approximately 50,000 bricks.

 It is said that kilns of this type, usually referred to as "rectangular up-

 draft" or "Scotch" kilns, usually were not built to hold more than 40,000
 bricks, and some held as few as I 5,000. On the basis of the estimate that
 the clay from the pit was sufficient to make half a million bricks, it is ap-
 parent that at least Io charges might have been burned in this kiln. It is
 also possible that additional earth was brought to this plant from other
 pits, particularly in view of its convenient location on the highway leading
 to the mainland.

 Period of Operation and Ownership of the Kiln

 There is no conclusive evidence, either historical or archeological, as to
 the period of the kiln's operation or its ownership. As mentioned before,
 none of the land records or other contemporary documents thus far dis-
 covered make any mention of a brick kiln being located in this part of
 Jamestown. The earliest known land record pertaining to the tract in which

 the kiln is located is the patent to Robert Beverley in 1 694. Beverley, who
 was 21 years of age at the time, received the property for the importation
 of one person to the Colony. A patent to Nathaniel Bacon, Sr., recorded in
 I683, for the tract to the east of Beverley's property, makes no mention of
 a brick kiln on the adjoining land. It would seem, therefore, that we are

 safe in assuming that the kiln had been abandoned, and possibly covered
 over and forgotten, when Beverley acquired the property in I694. There

 is archeological evidence that this process must have required several years.
 For one thing, a rather thick layer of sand accumulated in front of the kiln
 before a section of the wall collapsed and covered it.

 Also, there is no archeological evidence which would give a clue as to
 the exact period within the seventeenth century when the kiln was operated.

 Undoubtedly the surest method of dating the kiln, lacking historical records
 referring to it, would be to identify the bricks in a dated foundation as
 having been made at this kiln. A detailed study of this sort cannot be made
 at the present time, since all of the excavated foundations have been covered
 over again for preservation until a suitable method of exhibiting them has
 been worked out. However, based upon all the evidence at hand, it is
 the opinion of the author that this brickyard operated around the middle
 of the seventeenth century.

 How Bricks and Tiles Were Made at Jamestown

 From a study of the bricks and tiles made at Jamestown, and from con-

 temporary accounts of brickmaking and tilemaking in England, a fairly
 authentic description of the operation at Jamestown can be postulated.

 The first step was the digging and preparation of the clay.

 Before Christmas we begin to dig as deep as the Earth allows, and lay it as level
 as can be, and end before Candlemass, that it may lie mellow, that is, that the hard-
 lumps we dig may shake to pieces; which it will do either by help of Rain or Frost;
 when 'tis thus dug, we let it lie till Lady Day or Easter, when we seldom fear [for]
 fair weather. Then we water the Earth well, and temper it with a narrow Spade
 about five Inches broad, that the Workman may hold out, with which we dig it down,
 and then temper it with our bare feet till it is in good case to make a Brick on, that is,
 like a piece of Dough such as will just stick in the Mould or Frame when lifted up,
 and not fall ofF of it self; ... 25

 There were no archeological finds which would support or add to this
 description, and we may well accept it as the process used at Jamestown.
 The pugmill, now used by brickmakers who simulate colonial methods, was
 probably not introduced until the nineteenth century.

 The next step was the molding and drying of the bricks and tiles. Two
 distinct processes were used in England during the seventeenth century.
 In one the mold, an open rectangular frame, was set over a board known as

 a stock, which was attached to the table. The mold was lifted off, after
 being filled with clay, and the molded brick moved from the stock onto a
 pallet and then taken to the drying place. The second method, in which
 the mold has an integral bottom, is still the one commonly used today in
 making handmade bricks. After the mold was filled with clay and scraped

 off, or "struck," it was carried to the drying place and flipped over and then
 lifted off. In England, bricks made by these two processes were sometimes

 referred to coloquially as stock bricks and place bricks, respectively.

 We made two sorts of Bricks, viz., Stock Bricks and Place Bricks. The Stock Bricks
 are made solid, strong and so hard, that we have laid them under a Loaden Cart-wheel,

 and yet they will not break.26

 Place bricks were considered a poorer product and cost less than stock

 bricks.

 The term place bricks seems to have taken on a different meaning in
 later times, or, possibly in other localities. Moxon, in I 703 writes that place
 bricks are "so called because there is a Place just by where they strike (or
 mold) their Bricks."27 So-called "London stock bricks" are still made, or
 were a short time back, in some sections of England.28 A stock was used,
 exactly as described in the seventeenth century accounts. The bricks were
 baked in a special type of kiln known as a "clamp," rather than the more
 common up-draft type.

 Lacking any accounts of brickmaking at Jamestown, examination of the
 finished product is the only means of determining which of these two pro-
 cesses was used. Both the bricks and tiles are sanded on all but the "struck"
 (upper) side, and these sanded surfaces are relatively irregular and coarse.
 In the "stock" process, the stock, after some use, would become worn around

 its margins and would be repaired by tacking on a strip of leather or some
 other material. The effect of this was to form a sunken margin around the
 edge of the brick. No such condition has been observed on any of the
 Jamestown bricks. There is an indentation along part of one edge and one
 end of each brick on the struck side, made when the bricks were tipped out
 of the mold. The opposite edges are slightly raised where the clay was
 squeezed against the edge of the mold when it was flipped over (Figure 4).
 Another clue to the process used is the occurrence of animal footprints on

 a great many of the bricks and tiles. In every instance these prints are on

 the struck surface. Since all descriptions of the "stock" method state that
 the molded bricks were carried directly to the drying place on pallets and
 laid on edge to dry, and lacking other evidences characteristic of stock
 bricks, it seems almost certain that the second, or "place" brick, method
 was used at Jamestown. The peculiar markings caused when the mold was
 flipped over to remove the brick add further evidence to this conclusion.

 The following accounts describe clearly the process of molding and dry-

 ing bricks and tiles as it was undoubtedly carried on at Jamestown.

 . . .then we bring to the Earth a Table standing on four Legs, about three foot

 high, five foot and a half long, and three foot and a half over, and load it with as
 much as 'twill well bear at the Right Hand and about half way; . . . Then we have a
 Mould or Frame made of Beech, because the Earth will slip easiest from it. This
 Mould, Frame or Voyder is made of the bigness of the Brick ... we also have upon
 the table before the Mould or Frame a little Trough, that will hold about three or
 four quarts of water which we put in, and in it a strike to run over the Mould to make
 the Bricks smooth; this Strike is usually made of Firr, nine inches long, an inch and a
 half broad, and half inch thick, . . .29

 The table is also provided with a box or "minette," which is filled with
 sand. The brick mold is tossed into this sandbox by the molder's helper
 and sand is rubbed around on the inside of the mold before filling with clay.

 The moulder plunges his arms into the heap of earth, cuts off a piece weighing

 from 14 to Ii lb., throws it, in the first place, into the compartment (la case) of the
 mould nearest him, levelling it at the same time with his hand by heaping up the
 material in it, the excess of which he throws into the second compartment, which was
 not filled at the first charge, like the other one. He levels this compartment, too, by
 hand, heaping up the earth and filling any empty spaces. Seizing, at the same time,
 with his right hand, the strike, the handle of which is conveniently placed at the edge
 of the wetting trough, in which it has been soaking, he passes it firmly across the
 mould, to remove all that exceeds the 28 or 29 'lignes" of thickness that the two bricks
 should be. He gives a tap with the flat of the strike, as with a trowel, on the middle of
 the mould to separate the two bricks one from the other and places the surplus earth
 by his side on the table. The Carrier at once draws the mould towards him by the
 ears and sliding it to the edge of the table, raises it with both hands, turning it over
 and adroitly placing it on its edge, so that the two bricks, which are soft, can neither
 fall nor get out of shape. He proceeds to carry the two bricks the length of his walk
 (cordeau), there he holds the mould close to the ground, as if he were going to place
 it on its edge, but suddenly turning it over he lays it with the two bricks flat on the
 ground and lifts up the mould. He takes great care to execute this last movement

 vertically, for if it were done in the least obliquely, the two bricks would certainly be
 deformed. The Carrier then returns to the "minette" (sand bin) with his mould.30

 The bricks were left spread out in this drying place until they were

 slightly dried, probably one day, and then turned over, allowing them to
 dry more evenly. At this time, if necessary, they were "drest (that is cut
 off their Inequalities and Rugosities)." It was during this drying period
 that the animal prints were made in the partly dried bricks and tiles. The
 bottom, or struck, side would have been just the right firmness to have left

 a sharp impression of the animal's foot. This accounts for the fact that the
 tracks are all on the struck surface. If a brick had been stepped on during
 the first day, before the clay body had acquired sufficient "set," it would
 probably have been damaged beyond use.

 After the bricks had dried sufficiently in the drying place, they were

 stacked for curing.

 ... and when they are dry, they carry them to the Hacks (or places where they
 Row them up, like a Wall of two Bricks thick, with some small intervals betwixt them,
 to admit the wind and air to dry them). When the Hack is filled, they are covered

 with straw on the top, till they are dry enough to be carried to the Kiln to be burnt.31

 Sometimes these hacksteads were in the open and sometimes they were

 located in open sheds, depending, presumably, upon the climate. As in

 the case of the preparation of the earth and the tempering, no remains were

 found at the Jamestown brick plant relating to the molding and drying steps
 described above. If the area had been excavated completely it is possible

 that remains of bricks in the drying racks, or other evidences of these opera-
 tions might have been found. No remains of the equipment used would
 have lasted the 300 years since the plant was in operation, the table, mold,

 sand bin, and strike all being of wood.

 The roofing tiles were made by the same workmen and in much the same

 manner as the bricks. The paste had to be somewhat stiffer than for bricks,
 and greater care had to be exercised throughout the molding, drying, and
 burning. As the many animal footprints show, the tiles were laid out in
 the open, struck side down, and then turned over as soon as they could be
 handled. Two nail holes were punched in each tile from the struck side,
 probably when the tile was turned over the second day (Figure 4). Al-
 though more uniformly spaced than in most of the tiles from building
 foundations excavated at Jamestown, the spacing is not sufficiently uni-
 form to indicate that a template was used.

 The size of the crew working in a brickyard of that day, the number of
 bricks turned out in a day's time, and the wages paid the workers are also

 of interest. Here, again, we must resort largely to English records of that
 period. Lloyd gives the following information on the rate of production:

 In I683, Houghton states that a moulder, working alone, will turn out iooo bricks
 in a summer's day of 14 or I S hours. With the assistance of a man to temper the earth
 and of a boy to carry to the hacks he will turn out 2000 in a day, or an extraordinary

 man 3000.32

 Wages paid to brickmakers varied considerably, and Lloyd cites a number
 of contemporary references, some being by the thousand bricks, others by

 the day.33 The following is one of the more interesting accounts: "In i65 I,
 at Quarter Sessions, Chelmsford, the daily wages of 'Makers of Brick and
 Tile and Burners of Wood Ashes and Lime were fixed'" as follows: Mid-
 March to mid-September, with meat and drink -8 d.; without meat and
 drink - i6 d.; mid-September to mid-March, with meat and drink -6 d.;
 without -I 2 d.34 According to a Virginia statute of i 662, laborers work-
 ing for brickmakers were to receive "beside diett two thousand pounds of
 tobacco by the yeare."-5

 The annual production of a brickyard would depend both on the number

 of men employed and the length of the season. One Jamestown account,
 dated I662, in setting the legal wages to be paid a brickmaker, reads as
 follows:

 Brickmakers haveing theire diett and six able labourers to helpe them, provided at

 his or their charge that employ them, and wood sufficient brought in place for each
 thousand bricks moulded and burned, fortie pounds of tobacco.36

 This, very likely, reflects the typical brickmaking crew - a brickmaker

 and six laborers. Because of the danger of freezing, the brick molder at
 Jamestown would probably have begun his work about the first of April,
 and the last kiln would have had to have been fired by the middle or end
 of October. With so many unknown variables, it is impossible to estimate
 the annual output of the kiln described here, but it is doubtful if a small
 plant would have turned out more than one, or at the most, two kiln charges
 during a season.

 After the bricks or tiles were sufficiently dried, they were stacked in the

 kiln and fired. A description of the kiln and how the bricks were placed

 in it has been given above. According to a contemporary English descrip-
 tion, the firing proceeded as follows:

 Then we begin with half a Bavin37 Fire at a time in each Arch, supplying it contin-

 ually till the Water-Smoak be off; which is done when the Smoak begins to arise black,
 and usually in twenty-four hours, then we put in a whole Bavin at a time, . . . and
 thus we continue till they are at the top red fire hot, which is usually also twenty-four

 hours, and then we cease our Fire, and let them cool, and sell them as soon as we can

 for as much money as we can get, but usually about thirteen or fourteen shillings the
 thousand. The Prices for Making and Burning is seven shillings the thousand, the

 Wood three shillings the thousand.m

 This was an unusually short time for the firing, and it is likely that a
 larger kiln, such as the one at Jamestown, would have required from a week

 to ten days.

 The quality of the bricks in any one kiln varied considerably. They were

 usually classed in three groups. Those next to the fire (sometimes called
 "clinkers") were the best burned, some being glazed. Next to these in the

 kiln were those that were considered best for general use, and they probably

 constituted the majority. The outermost, or poorest bricks, were not looked

 on with favor. They were called "samel" or "sandel" bricks, probably from
 their salmon color, and it was said that they would "molder away like Dirt,

 with the least moisture."39

 The price received for finished bricks varied over the century, but appears
 to have been less in the Colony than in England. A statute of I662 set
 the price as follows:

 Bricks being statute bricks and well burned, one hundred and fiftie pounds of

 tobacco per thousand.40

 Description of Jamestown Bricks and Tiles

 In addition to the process of manufacturing bricks and tiles, their physi-

 cal characteristics are of interest, although contrary to common belief, the
 date of a brick building cannot be determined from the size and appearance
 of the bricks alone. As Lloyd says of English bricks: "At best, dating
 buildings by brick dimensions can only be vaguely approximate, and afford
 but slender aid to the more reliable architectural features and to precise

 historic records in determining dates."'41

 Even so, on the whole the bricks from a given kiln have certain distinct

 characteristics. This is not always the case in buildings, however, since
 the bricks may have come from more than one source. At Jamestown, for
 instance, salvaged bricks were often used, and additions and alterations to
 the buildings were frequent.

 There was also some change in the normal brick size during the Colonial

 period, and possibly some change during Jamestown's history. Study of
 the bricks from all structures excavated at Jamestown suggests that the
 bricks made during the first half of the century were slighdy longer and
 thinner than those made during the latter part of the century. Similarly,

 there is a marked trend toward shorter, narrower, and thicker bricks during
 the next century. Because of the dearth of historical records by which
 foundations can be dated, and the meagerness of other architectural cri-
 teria, such as would be available in a standing structure, bricks tend to as-

 sume too much importance in dating foundations, such as those at Jamestown.
 As the table of Jamestown brick sizes shows (Appendix), the bricks in

 Jamestown foundations run about 83/4 to 9 inches in length, 4 to 43/8 inches
 in width, and 21/4 to 2Y2 inches in thickness.42 There are bricks departing

 markedly from this range in structures, presumably of the Jamestown period,
 in other parts of Tidewater Virginia. For example, the Thorogood House
 in Princess Anne County (believed to date from about i640) has a very
 uniform brick measuring 8h by 4Y8 by 21/4 inches. In many seventeenth
 century structures, however, such as St. Luke's Church in Isle of Wight
 County, the Warren House (Rolfe House) and Bacon's Castle in Surry
 County, and Christ's Cross in New Kent County, the bricks run about
 the same as those at Jamestown.

 In appearance, the bricks used at Jamestown have the usual wide range

 of colors and textures found in handmade bricks. They vary from light
 yellows and oranges to deep reds, browns, red-purple, olive green, and even
 chocolate. On the whole, the colors are relatively soft shades of brown,
 salmon, and medium to dark red. The wide variety of colors, used at ran-
 dom throughout the walls, produced the pleasing brick surfaces common
 in that period.

 On the whole, all surfaces of the bricks, except the struck side, are relative-
 ly irregular, with course sanded texture. Glazing is frequent, often extend-
 ing over only a portion of the surface and more common on the ends than

 42Bricks from the kiln (Structure I02) varied in size as follows: Length, 8? to 9? inches;

 width, 4 to 45A inches; and thickness, 2% to 2z8 inches. The size of approximately half of the
 bricks, however, was the "average" size of 9 by 4Y4 by 2% inches.

 the sides of the brick. This, too, added to the naturally random appearance
 of the finished wall. It is doubtful if the Jamestown masons, except in rare
 instances, used glazed headers to form patterns, or to produce the monoto-

 nous eflect resulting from every header being glazed. Almost certainly
 glazed surfaces were accidental in the manufacturing process and were used

 at random throughout the wall along with the general run of the kiln.

 Hardness and porosity are difficult to describe, and of little value, since
 the bricks at Jamestown range from the light salmon ones, very soft and

 porous, to those as hard and dense as paving bricks.

 To the author's knowledge no one has ever used an objective method

 for describing texture, color, and physical properties of handmade bricks.
 It has been suggested that various laboratory analyses might furnish a clue as
 to the source of bricks and date of manufacture, but, apparently, no such
 study has been attempted. Color, density, and refractoriness, of course,
 vary with the temperature of firing, as well as with the original clay, but

 this can be corrected for laboratory analyses by refiring to critical tempera-
 tures. The success in identifying clay sources of prehistoric Indian pottery
 in the American Southwest indicates that similar analyses would be feasible

 with bricks.43

 Jamestown roofing tiles, like bricks, vary greatly in size, color, hardness,
 and surface texture. There seem to be no records available as to statutory

 limitations on the size of roofing tiles after I 477, when the size was required
 to be io? by 64 x s/8 inches. Those found in the kiln at Jamestown were
 fairly uniform in size, and ran about Io by 6?8 by 5/8 inches, or very close
 to the statute size of I477.

 Relatively few whole tiles have been recovered from the excavations at
 Jamestown, outside of those from the kiln, but a large quantity of broken
 ones have been found, mostly the flat type, or shingle tile. Although con-
 siderable quantities of broken pantiles have also been found, they were ap-
 parently used much less commonly than the shingle tile. Because of their
 less frequent occurrence, and since there is no evidence that pantiles were
 made at Jamestown, they will not be discussed in detail here. Those found
 are the dissymetrical ogee shape, with a lug on the under surface at the

 upper end. They are about I 4 inches long, 9 inches wide, and 5/8 inch thick.
 They were made in a sanded mold, struck on one face, as were the flat tiles,
 with the lug on the bottom, or sanded surface.

 The flat tiles from the kiln, in addition to being of a relatively uniform
 size, are all a light buff, straw, or very light orange-tan color. This, and
 their relative softness, is probably due to under-burning in the kiln. They
 are usually warped slightly, leaving the struck side slightly concave. The
 sanded surface, which is believred to have been the exposed side when laid,
 is quite uneven, resembling the sanded surfaces of the bricks from the same
 kiln. The edges on this surface are rounded, unlike the sharp edges on the

 struck side.

 One of the most obvious characteristics of the tiles from the kiln is the

 uniformity of the position of the nail holes. Like all of the flat tiles, these
 holes were punched into the partially dried clay, using a circular, tapered
 tool. There is nearly always some clay left at the bottom of the hole where
 the punch struck against the ground or other surface on which the tile laid.
 In the tiles from the kiln these holes were punched quite uniformly one
 inch from each edge.

 The flat tiles found from the excavated foundations are mostly harder
 and better made than those from the kiln. They run somewhat smaller in
 size, which may have been due, in part, to better burning.44 The nail
 holes in these tiles are much less uniformly spaced than in those from the
 kiln, although similar in shape. This feature adds a useful criterion to
 color, size, texture, and other characteristics as a means of determining the

 provenience of this type of tile.

 Conclusions

 It is quite clear, from the documentary records and the archeological
 remains, that the Jamestown colonists not only made their own bricks,
 and probably many of their roofing tiles, but that the process, as well as
 the finished product, followed closely the English tradition. Although the
 Jamestown bricks depart somewhat from the English statute size for that
 period, the product of contemporary English kilns appears to have varied
 as much. The complexity of the process and the influence of the craft
 guilds, both of which required years of apprenticeship before a man could
 practice the trade, made it almost inevitable that the English methods
 be followed.

 Some modifications in the various techniques involved in brickmaking
 undoubtedly came about during the century of Jamestownn's growth and
 decline. Different materials and conditions would naturally cause some

 changes, and the less restricted social and economic atmosphere might have
 given more opportunity for the expression of individual tastes and whims.
 On the whole, though, the archeological evidence fits with the accounts
 in the English records, and makes it possible to give a relatively complete
 and detailed picture of brickmaking and tilemaking at Jamestown.
