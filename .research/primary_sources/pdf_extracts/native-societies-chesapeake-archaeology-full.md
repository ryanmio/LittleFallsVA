 Abstract Archaeological studies of Native American societies in the Chesapeake
 have recently incorporated a broader range of interpretive frames, including those
 that emphasize historical contingency and social interaction rather than cultural
 ecology and cultural materialism. New evidence of Woodland-period population
 movements, persistent places, and cycles of social ranking has prompted historically
 oriented interpretations that foreground particular configurations of ideology, tra
 dition, ritual, and agency. Contact-period studies have demonstrated that native
 strategies of the colonial period were rooted in precontact social landscapes. Con
 temporary American Indians are also reclaiming their pasts in ways that challenge
 archaeological practices and further broaden perspectives on the Chesapeake past.

 Introduction

 Recent excavations on Virginia's coastal plain have revealed the complicated
 history of a Late Woodland community, a case study that brings into focus several
 prominent themes in the current archaeological literature of the Chesapeake
 (Blanton et al. 1999). Blanton and colleagues (1999, p. 92) traced a history whereby
 250 to 300 "uncomfortable immigrants" constructed a large, compact settlement

 during the 14th century AD that was surrounded by a double palisade, rectangular
 bastions, and an encircling ditch. During the 15th century the immigrants, possibly
 originating from Owasco communities of the upper Susquehanna, created a
 "flourishing Tidewater culture" as the village lost its defensive orientation and its

 settlers interred ancestors in collective ossuaries (Blanton et al. 1999, p. 96). A
 century later, Potomac Creek residents established a second village nearby that was
 home to the local weroance (or political leader) and central to the social landscape
 of the Patawomekes, an Algonquian-speaking people who figured prominently in
 the Chesapeake's early colonial history. From Patawomeck, or "trading place"
 (Barbour 1971, p. 296), and related settlements along the Potomac, the Patawome

 kes were a counterweight to the Powhatan paramountcy that exercised authority
 across coastal Virginia during the early colonial era (Potter 1993, pp. 170-175; Rice

 2007). Today, descendants of the Patawomekes remain in the Chesapeake region,
 are engaged in the archaeology at Potomac Creek, and have drawn on this research

 in their recently successful effort to gain official status as a recognized tribe.

 As a prominent example of recent Chesapeake archaeology, the Potomac Creek

 research highlights themes that have become more important in the region during
 the last two decades: explanations of cultural change as shaped by historical
 contingency and social interaction; population movements that introduced new
 traditions and social conflicts amid a diverse precontact setting; persistent places
 that became centers of resource procurement, feasting, ritual, and social ranking;
 exchange cycles that connected disparate communities within and beyond the
 Chesapeake; research that spans historical archaeology and "prehistory" in order to
 track links between precontact developments and colonial-era events; and the re

 emergence of descendant communities seeking to reclaim their pasts, sometimes in
 ways that challenge accepted narratives and standard archaeological practices.

 Until fairly recently, the precontact archaeology of the Chesapeake has been
 characterized as a parochial backwater where researchers have been reticent to join
 the discipline's epistemological debates (Mouer 1997; Waselkov 1997). Much of the

 archaeology conducted in the region has aimed at describing diagnostic artifacts and
 at understanding adaptive changes to environmental settings. Although the best
 examples of such efforts have provided effective frameworks for material culture,

 settlement patterns, and subsistence regimes, it is also clear that these approaches
 have placed interpretive constraints on the region's archaeology. The prominent role
 played by avocationalists in the study of native sites, particularly in Virginia
 (MacCord 1990) but also in Maryland (Curry 1999), has resulted in extensive
 excavation along with archaeology that is at times less attuned to developments

 influencing other North American regions. Late Woodland archaeology and early
 colonial accounts together have made the Chesapeake "the laboratory to explore the
 archaeological fingerprint of complex societies" on the Atlantic coast (Stewart 1995,
 p. 195), yet chiefdom studies in the Chesapeake have had, at best, mixed success at
 identifying archaeological patterning to balance colonial accounts (e.g., Binford
 1964; Gallivan 2003; Potter 1993; Rountree and Turner 1998; Turner 1986).

 Recent studies have begun to push against these limitations. As is the case
 elsewhere in North America, an eclectic range of theoretical perspectives has taken

 root in the Chesapeake (Means and Klein 2003), including those that highlight Native
 American materiality (e.g., Hantman 1990; Potter 2006), body symbolism (e.g.,
 Pietak 1998), social hybridity (e.g., Dent 2005; Moore 1993), landscape and
 emplacement (e.g., Gallivan 2007; Knepper et al. 2006), poststructuralist analysis of
 ritual (e.g., Dunham 1999), Braduelian temporalities (e.g., Jirikowic 1995; Klein and

 Sanford 2004), world-systems theory (e.g., Hall and Chase-Dunn 1999; Stewart
 2004), Darwinian evolutionary theory (e.g., Boyd 2004a), and indigenous perspec
 tives (e.g., Clark and Custer 2003; Hantman et al. 2000). Researchers have begun to

 consider historically oriented interpretations that foreground particular configurations
 of exchange networks, ideology, tradition, ritual, and agency. Efforts to understand

 the social significance of artifact styles, cultural boundaries, and ceremonial centers
 have opened the possibility of a new era in which precontact Chesapeake archaeology
 could become the basis for a long-term history of native societies that crosses the

 contact/precolonial divide in a seamless way (cf. Hodder 1987; Nassaney and Johnson
 2000). Cultural ecological approaches remain in place, but these are increasingly
 informed by more nuanced climate histories (e.g., Stahle et al. 1998), geoarchaeo
 logical models (e.g., Monaghan et al. 2004), paleoecological records (e.g.,
 McWeeney and Kellogg 2001), and subsistence data (e.g., Messner 2008) that
 highlight localized conditions and the complex relationships that link environment,

 culture, and history (e.g., Rice 2009). Many of the recent interpretive shifts have been
 enabled, in part, by an expanded evidentiary base generated by CRM (e.g., Stewart
 2000). Several leaders of the more historically oriented archaeology beginning to

 emerge in the Chesapeake had, in previous years, been advocates of systemic models
 of culture, neo-evolutionary typologies, and adaptationist explanations.

 This essay reviews Chesapeake research from the past two decades, focusing
 selectively on Woodland through contact-period studies that address these themes. I
 depend on several regional summaries (e.g., Custer 1994a; Dent 1995; Hantman and
 Gold 2002; Little 1995; Stewart 1995) and a series of period-based reviews from the
 Council of Virginia Archaeologists (Blanton 2003; Hodges 2004; Klein 2003a;
 Reinhart and Hodges 1991, 1992; Turner 2004). With the exception of the
 internationally significant investigations of the pre-Clovis Cactus Hill site (McAvoy
 and McAvoy 1997), much of the recent archaeology conducted in the region that has
 broader importance centers on the Woodland period and on early colonial contact.
 Where archaeological studies of the Chesapeake have typically focused on the
 rise of native polities cast as archetypal chiefdoms (e.g., Potter 1993; Rountree and
 Turner 2002; Turner 1976), the richly detailed archaeological evidence from recent
 field research highlights historical processes not easily accommodated within
 existing social typologies. In conjunction with the area's voluminous early colonial
 accounts, the Chesapeake is now poised to become one of the primary regions in
 North America in which archaeologists foreground historical processes of native
 social construction that cross the colonial/prehistoric divide. Of broad significance
 for the archaeology of native North America are Chesapeake cultural landscapes
 and related social dynamics of the Woodland period that come into sharper focus

 during the early historic era as Native American communities developed distinctive
 responses to colonial incursions.

 Defining the region

 The Chesapeake region is defined in large part by the Chesapeake Bay, the largest
 estuary in the United States and home to rich and diverse ecological systems and

 ecotonal settings (Curtin et al. 2001; Rountree et al. 2007). The region is drained by
 rivers flowing into the Bay, including the Susquehanna, Choptank, Nanticoke,
 Patuxent, Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, and extends as far north as

 New York's Finger Lakes and as far west as the Great Appalachian Valley (Fig. 1).
 Particularly after the 1971 establishment of the Middle Atlantic Archaeological
 Conference, the Chesapeake has been subsumed within a Middle Atlantic region
 that stretches along the Atlantic coast from New York to Virginia and west to the
 ridge and valley province (Custer 1994a). For those favoring a culture-area
 approach, the Chesapeake suffers along with the Middle Atlantic from uncertainty
 as to whether it belongs with the Northeast or the Southeast culture area; at different
 points in the precontact sequence, one or the other regional affinity seems more

 appropriate (Custer 1994a, p. 329; Hantman and Gold 2002, p. 271). Researchers
 going back to Holmes (1897, pp. 19-20) nonetheless have argued persuasively that
 the Chesapeake represents a coherent natural and cultural unit within eastern North
 American archaeology (Dent 1995, p. 2).

 The archaeological record beginning c. 1200 BC points to the salience of cultural

 traditions and social networks within a "Chesapeake" region that includes the coastal
 plain and piedmont provinces of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. Recent
 summaries of Chesapeake natural history (e.g., Dent 1995, pp. 69-95; LeeDecker
 1991; Miller 2001), drawing on analyses by Carbone (1976), Brush (1986, 2001), and

 others, provide the ecological parameters framing the region's culture history. Marine
 transgression triggered by the rising sea levels of the Holocene formed the
 Chesapeake Bay and its extensive estuary, a process that was essentially complete
 by 3000 years ago (Dent 1995, pp. 83-84). At roughly the same time, c. 1200 BC,
 steatite-tempered Marcey Creek pottery appeared throughout the coastal plain and
 piedmont regions from Delaware south to the James River in Virginia (Egloff and
 Potter 1982, p. 95), highlighting the emergence of social networks and, possibly,
 shared ceremonial practices (Klein 1997) of the Chesapeake. Shell-tempered
 Mockley ceramics appeared c. AD 200 across coastal Chesapeake, introducing a
 fall-line boundary between the coastal plain and the piedmont and a smaller area
 marked by a shared ceramic tradition (Egloff 1985). While Chesapeake archaeology
 typically focuses on the coastal plain after the appearance of Mockley pottery,
 continuing links into the piedmont have long been recognized in the archaeological
 and ethnohistorical records (e.g., Hantman 1990; 1993; Kavanaugh 1982; Mouer
 1983; Rountree 1993). By the 16th century, a circum-Chesapeake exchange sphere

 that conveyed locally produced shell beads and copper objects from beyond the region
 is apparent archaeologically (Klein and Sanford 2004, pp. 58-64). The Chesapeake
 region includes the history of coastal Algonquians as well as Iroquoian and Siouan
 speakers of the interior who were impacted by early European colonization on the
 Atlantic coast. Although defining the archaeological record in terms of a Chesapeake
 region surrounding the bay requires accepting an area with both artificial and
 permeable limits and considerable internal diversity, the area does have clear
 historical and cultural coherence during the final three millennia of prehistory.

 Archaeological study of the Chesapeake has a long and storied past that includes
 work by Jefferson (1787), Holmes (1890, 1897), Binford (1964), and prominent
 figures of historical archaeology (e.g., Deetz 1996; Leone 1995). Research here has
 played a role in the beginnings of problem-oriented archaeology in Jefferson's
 excavation of a Monacan burial mound (Hantman and Dunham 1993), an early case

 study in processual archaeology (Binford 1991), innovative studies of native social
 complexity that combine archaeology and ethnohistory (e.g., Rountree and Turner
 2002), and excavations at the early English colonial settlement of Jamestown (e.g.,
 Kelso 2006). The Chesapeake also benefits from pioneering programs of archae
 ological research associated with outdoor museums (e.g., Brown and Edwards 2006;
 Miller 2007) and urban areas (e.g., Cressey and Vinton 2007, Leone 2005), though

 these programs typically focus on non-native histories. In fact, the prominence of
 historical archaeology across the Chesapeake often overshadows the region's Native

 American past. Prior to the 1990s, efforts to characterize the archaeological record

 of the region's native societies focused on cultural-ecological frameworks and neo
 evolutionary models (e.g., Custer 1989a; Gardner 1982). During that era of research,
 settlement pattern studies took center stage (e.g., Potter 1982; Turner 1976), often
 emphasizing a Woodland period focused on productive estuarine and riverine
 environments, and cultural developments understood as adaptations to changes in
 Holocene environments.

 More recently, Dent (1995) has provided a comprehensive summary of research

 in the region and the authoritative reference on the region's culture history. Writing

 in the early 1990s, Dent highlighted a handful of efforts to consider the importance

 of cultural actors, agency, and symbolism in the archaeology of the Chesapeake,
 themes that already had considerable influence outside of the region. Dent (1995,
 p. 66) was heartened by the appearance of archaeological and ethnohistorical
 research, including studies by Haynes (1990), Jirikowic (1990), and Williamson
 (1979), that began to broaden the then-standard reliance on paleoenvironmental
 discontinuities to explain social configurations and culture change in the Chesa
 peake. Adding his own voice, Dent (1995, pp. 277-284) proposed that the rise of
 chiefdoms in the Chesapeake coincided with an internal reordering of social life
 during the 16th century triggered by the balkanization of regional groups,
 population movements, European-introduced disease, and elites' usurpation of
 ancestral power. In his review of Middle Atlantic archaeology, Custer (1994a,
 p. 347) similarly noted sporadic signs of increased social complexity, or "flashes in

 the pan," from the Late Archaic through contact periods that failed to accord in any
 simple way with environmental parameters. Picking up on this theme, Hantman and
 Gold (2002, p. 289) noted that the Middle Atlantic region was characterized after
 1200 BC by a long-term cyclical pattern whereby competition for rank "was defined
 by the ability to access nonlocal prestige goods and distinctive mortuary ritual." I
 borrow from this line of thought, traceable through Dent, Custer, Hantman, and
 Gold, to organize this review.

 Early Woodland

 Sites dating to the Early Woodland period (1200-500 BC) have seen relatively
 limited recent excavation in the Chesapeake, though researchers have applied
 innovative interpretations to the study of early ceramics, settlement organization,

 and floodplain geoarchaeology (Klein 2003a, p. 207). The general point of departure
 for most Early Woodland research in the Chesapeake is a fusion-fission settlement
 model based on seasonal oscillation between macrogroup/habitation sites and
 microgroup/temporary camp sites (Custer 1989a, p. 198). Increasing population and
 sedentism between 1100 BC and 500 BC have been tied to more efficient

 exploitation of resources in localized areas of natural food diversity (Klein and
 Klatka 1991; Turner 1976). During this period, hunter-foragers also developed new
 storage and container technologies within large, semisedentary base camps during a
 "Transitional period," hinting at things to come (Mouer 1991).

 The Early Woodland period in the Chesapeake is marked by the adoption of Marcey

 Creek pottery and a number of similar "experimental" wares by hunter-foragers who

 constructed vessels from slabs of clay molded by hand into trough or bowl shapes
 (Dent 1995, p. 225; Egloff 1991; Egloff and Potter 1982, pp. 95-97). Marcey Creek
 ceramics were tempered with crushed steatite and typically had vessel forms
 mimicking the shapes of soapstone vessels that moved through Late Archaic exchange
 networks. In the Chesapeake, soapstone bowls appeared sporadically and in small
 numbers, suggesting limited access (Blanton 2003). A concentration of Late Archaic
 and Early Woodland soapstone vessels in northeastern Maryland bearing unusually
 elaborate decorations may signal that the area served as a "gateway zone," or cultural
 boundary area, between the distinct social spheres of the Chesapeake and of the
 Pennsylvania Uplands (Shaffer 2008).

 Klein (1997, p. 147, 2003a, pp. 218-219) has presented evidence that

 Chesapeake soapstone vessels were used for indirect cooking, stone boiling, and
 serving meats and ritual teas rather than for generalized cooking. His model for the
 subsequent adoption of ceramics in the Chesapeake is an example of Early
 Woodland research foregrounding regional interaction, social agency, and the social
 import of material culture. Drawing on similar arguments from Sassaman (1993)
 and ethnographic evidence pointing to the use of soapstone vessels as specialized
 containers, Klein argues that the movement of Marcey Creek vessels across the
 Chesapeake signaled efforts to maintain a ceremonial sphere linked by exchange
 ties involving soapstone. Marcey Creek ceramics occur in high frequencies on a
 limited number of sites (e.g., Mouer 1991, p. 40), suggesting the presence of
 individuals or communities who controlled access to soapstone and who coordi
 nated feasting and ceremony associated with the bowls (Hantman and Gold 2002,
 p. 278). Marcey Creek ceramics appear to represent an attempt to extend such
 practices that originated with earlier soapstone bowls. The subsequent shift to coil
 constructed, quartz- and sand-tempered wares (including Accokeek Creek) made
 ceramic vessels more widely available. The widespread adoption of quartz- and
 sand-tempered wares may have resulted from efforts to develop expedient container
 technologies that were independent of the social networks and ceremonial spheres
 through which soapstone flowed. Accokeek Creek vessels from the Early Woodland
 period were generally limited to intensively reused macrogroup base camps in
 ecologically attractive settings (Stewart 1998a, p. 2). Such places include some of
 the earliest evidence of residential architecture in the region (e.g., McLearan 1991),
 indicating that sedentism and aggregation created conditions that led to the
 production of expedient containers (Klein 2003a, p. 219). This historical process
 may well be implicated in the disruption of older, ceremonial exchange networks
 involving soapstone.

 Efforts to characterize Early Woodland settlement forms have benefited from

 studies of hunter-forager aggregation sites that exhibit high artifact concentrations
 and intact features (e.g., Blanton 2003; Mouer 1991). Drawing on data from large,
 densely occupied settlements in the James River piedmont, Mouer (1991, p. 70) has
 argued that "sedentary, village-dwelling societies developed in Virginia much
 earlier than was previously believed," during the terminal Late Archaic when a shift
 to riverine adaptations triggered changes in subsistence, technology, site size, and
 site density. Piedmont sites near the fall-line zone exhibit extensive artifact
 concentrations, platform hearths for large, seasonal food preparation events, and an

 array of pit features. Artifact assemblages from these sites include concentrations of

 grooved axes, steatite vessels, and stone gorgets tied to land clearing, exchange, and
 expressions of identity.

 Subsequent Early Woodland research has indicated that such sites were, in fact,
 places of intensive, seasonal occupations of hunter-foragers rather than settlements
 with large, permanent populations (e.g., Custer 1994b). Concentrations of hunter
 forager aggregation sites dating to the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods
 have been identified in several parts of the Chesapeake, including the western rim of
 the Dismal Swamp (Blanton 2002; Lichtenberger et al. 1994) and on the Delmarva
 Peninsula (Custer 1989a, pp. 185-248). Excavations at the Clyde Farm site on the
 Delmarva Peninsula identified a concentration of contemporaneous features dated c.

 1000 BC that comprised a "household cluster," including a rectangular pit house, an
 external storage pit and hearth, and an area containing lithic tool production debris
 (Custer 1989a, pp. 196-198; Custer et al. 1987). Blanton (2003, p. 187) describes an
 almost continuous concentration of Late Archaic and Early Woodland sites at the
 edge of the Dismal Swamp that exhibit similar signs of residential stability,
 including pit features, large hearths, and cemetery areas. Only one of these sites has
 been excavated systematically (Blanton 2003), though others are known from
 surface collections. Recovered artifacts reflect a wide array of projectile point styles
 within single, apparently contemporaneous, contexts, and dense concentrations of
 groundstone tools, grooved axes, bola weights, and roller-type pestles.

 Much of this material may be understood in terms of an "intensification" of

 settlement and subsistence-related activities within resource-rich wetland settings
 (Blanton 2003, p. 188). The numbers and diversity of nonlocal stone artifacts within
 these Early Woodland settlements also highlight newly expanded social networks

 animated by large gatherings of hunter-foragers from distinct cultural traditions (e.g.,
 Custer 1989a, pp. 235-247). In such settings, the density and variety of elaborately
 crafted "bannerstones" (i.e., spear-thrower weights) may, in fact, parallel expres
 sions of "assertive identities" by distinct individuals, as noted in other places of
 hunter-forager aggregation near the Atlantic Coast (Sassaman 1998, 2005).

 Locations with evidence of large-scale gatherings, specialized containers, and
 large food preparation facilities also likely played a role in the Early Woodland
 Chesapeake as places of seasonal aggregation and feasting. Archaeological studies
 of feasts emphasize that such events served diverse ends, ranging from social
 reproduction to social stratification (Joyce and Henderson 2007), and incorporated
 strategies that include establishing alliances for war and marriage, mobilizing labor,
 creating political power and economic advantages, and redistributing wealth
 (Dietler and Hayden 2001). Feasting can sometimes be recognized in the
 archaeological record by unusual types and quantities of food, elaborate food
 preparation techniques and facilities, and unusual serving vessels (e.g., Potter 2000;
 Spielmann 2002). Of course, not every roasting platform, decorated pot, and dense

 food deposit identified in the Chesapeake represents a feast, yet the co-occurrence of
 such evidence in places of large-scale gatherings points to the feasting and social
 negotiation that accompanied seasonal aggregation in the region.

 The construction of houses and cemeteries and the reuse of favored locations

 reflected in artifact accumulations also point to the growing importance of

 "persistent places" (Littleton and Allen 2007; Schlanger 1992) and related changes
 in the relationship between people and landscape. Persistent places are locations that
 are used repeatedly during the long-term occupation of a region (Schlanger 1992,
 p. 92) that may result from the unique qualities of particular locales, from built
 environments that focus reoccupations, or from repeated revisitation over the long
 term (Littleton and Allen 2007, p. 296). Understanding the social integration and
 status competition that occurred in these locations during the Early Woodland
 period requires a great deal more intensive fieldwork in places like the Dismal
 Swamp and the Delmarva Peninsula.

 Middle Woodland

 While the archaeology of Early Woodland aggregation sites remains poorly
 understood, the Chesapeake's Middle Woodland archaeology offers a more fully
 developed record that points to population movements, hunter-forager interaction,

 cycles of social ranking, and the establishment of ceremonial centers. Recent studies
 of these developments in the Chesapeake have combined new methods of
 chronology construction, ceramic stylistic analysis, and historical linguistics that
 have broad significance beyond the region. The Middle Woodland period in the
 Chesapeake (500 BC-AD 900) has been characterized as a period of "technological
 homogenization" (Dent 1995, p. 235) during which the use of shell-tempered
 Mockley ceramics by native peoples spread rapidly across much of the coastal
 Chesapeake (Blanton 1992, pp. 74-76; Custer 1989a, pp. 276-277; R. Stewart
 1992). Whether this change was the result of population replacement or a new focus
 on estuarine resources remains unclear. The "Mockley spread" coincided with a
 settlement shift toward estuarine zones in the outer coastal plain and a "burst of

 human activity" apparent in the dramatically increased numbers of sites in the
 Chesapeake (Blanton and Pullins 2004, p. 69). Some outer coastal plain sites exhibit
 shell middens covering several hectares (e.g., Dent 1995, pp. 240-241; Opperman
 1992; Waselkov 1982). Excavation of such sites near the mouth of the James River

 exposed large burial grounds, deep storage pits, and communities that were fully
 sedentary or nearly so (Hodges 1998, pp. 200-201). The Middle Woodland, then,
 emerges as the period when a shift to increased reliance on estuarine resources
 coincided with the regional spread of shell-tempered pottery, developments that
 may have resulted from the arrival of new populations and/or the adoption of new
 adaptations by indigenous communities. Mockley ceramics first appeared on
 Maryland's Eastern Shore and subsequently spread throughout the Chesapeake,
 apparently heralding the arrival and spread of Algonquian-speaking populations
 ancestral to those present at contact (Herbert 2008, pp. 273-274). Complicating this

 scenario of simple population replacement, though, are indications that Mockley
 sites coexisted alongside those exhibiting localized wares (McLearan and Mouer
 1989, p. 22), pointing to the movement of distinct populations within overlapping
 territories (Hodges 1998, p. 190).

 Recent research in the region has added studies of ceramic technology, settlement
 patterns, exchange networks, historical linguistics, population movements, and

 interaction between culturally distinct hunter-forager communities. Klein's (1994)
 "absolute" ceramic sedation offers substantial improvements over the use of ware/
 type classifications, particularly for purposes of chronology construction. Drawing
 from Braun's (1985) ceramic engineering model and a suite of radiocarbon-dated
 features in Virginia, Klein developed regression equations that estimate the date of
 Middle Woodland through contact-period assemblages on an absolute scale. The
 equations depend on attributes such as sherd thickness, temper size, and vessel
 morphology and generate more precise temporal predictions than possible with
 diagnostic artifacts in phase-based dating on a relative scale.

 Settlement pattern models proposed for the Middle Woodland include modified
 versions of Binford's (1980) collector model and a related "fusion-fission" pattern
 centered on macroband base camps (Blanton 1992). Potter's (1993) survey of
 Middle and Late Woodland settlements on Virginia's Northern Neck fleshes out
 these possibilities with a detailed, local study. From AD 200 to 550 hunter-forager
 groups there moved seasonally between small interior camps and intermediate-sized
 shell midden sites in riverine and wetland areas. Much larger shell midden sites,
 including Boathouse Pond, appeared after AD 550; such locations served as places
 of hunter-forager aggregation for several centuries thereafter.

 Persistent places and far-flung networks are particularly well expressed in the

 Delmarva Adena phenomenon from 500 BC to AD 1 (Custer 1987a, 1989a,
 pp. 249-275; Stewart 2004, pp. 343-345). A small number of sites on the Delmarva
 Peninsula dating to this interval contain trade items that originated in the
 midwestern Adena. Distinctive Adena artifacts include tubular pipes, copper beads
 and gorgets, and Flint Ridge chalcedony bifaces. Most Delmarva Adena sites were
 locations of elaborate mortuary rituals that included secondary burials and
 cremations. Delmarva Adena may have entailed sporadic, ritualized exchange
 between select Chesapeake groups and those in the Ohio Valley (Custer 1989a,
 p. 262) or, perhaps, the migration into the area of lineages with ties to Adena
 ceremonialism. Under Stewart's (2004, p. 341) model of Middle Atlantic exchange,
 Delmarva Adena is a primary example of the "focused" networks that arose
 sporadically across the Middle Atlantic through which entrepreneurs or lineages
 insinuated themselves within informal trade networks to obtain exotica. The

 geographically circumscribed distribution of these sites and the quantities of
 imported items raise the possibility that Delmarva Adena sites are high-status burial
 grounds that asserted social ranking and "big man" status (Custer 1989a, p. 268).

 A second example that appears, on first glance, to reflect focused exchange is the
 distribution of Abbott zoned-incised pottery. Abbott ceramics, which include
 elaborate combinations of incised lines unlike other ceramics in the region (Cross
 1956, p. 144), have been recovered in substantial numbers from Middle Woodland

 deposits at the Abbott Farm site in New Jersey, from at least six sites in coastal

 Virginia, and from a handful of other northeastern locations (Stewart 1998b, p. 173).
 Stewart (1998b) argues persuasively that Abbott vessels played a role in ceremonial
 feasting, particularly in aggregation locations that were well positioned to exploit
 seasonal, anadromous fish runs. The Maycock's Point site on the James River
 contains Abbott zoned-incised pottery in shell middens dating from AD 200 to 900
 (Gregory 1983; Heinsman and Duncan 2006; Opperman 1992). The presence of

 Abbott ceramics at Maycock's Point raises the possibility that these materials record
 long-distance trade with groups 400 km to the north in the Delaware Valley.

 Analysis of vessel morphology supports the inference that Abbott zoned-incised

 vessels from Maycock's Point were serving vessels with sizes and shapes distinct
 from the Mockley ceramics that dominate the assemblage (Duncan and Gallivan
 2006). Faunal remains record the consumption of considerable quantities of fish,
 oyster, deer, and wetland tubers at the location, and possibly a year-round
 occupation (Barber and Madden 2006). Trace element analysis of Abbott zoned
 incised pottery from Maycock's Point and Abbott Farm indicates that the two
 assemblages were produced independently from local clays, despite the presence of
 identical decorative motifs (Steadman 2008). Rather than focused exchange, the
 ceramics at Maycock's Point apparently highlight the regional movement of
 feasting practices and, possibly, of Middle Woodland populations.

 Recent linguistic research provides some context for this finding. Drawing on
 earlier efforts (e.g., Goddard 1978; Luckenbach et al. 1987; Siebert 1967, 1975),
 Fiedel (1994, p. 1, 1999) has used glottochronology and protolexicon reconstruction
 to make the case that "a unified Proto-Algonquian linguistic community existed as
 late as the Middle Woodland period." The reconstructed Proto-Algonquian
 vocabulary includes cognate terms for smoking pipes, earthworks, bows, and
 arrows, items that became prominent in the Northeast during the Middle Woodland
 period. Combining these linguistic patterns with abrupt changes in artifact
 sequences and settlement orientations, Fiedel (1999, p. 199) sees evidence for the
 initial development of Proto-Algonquians in southern Ontario and their outward
 movement between 500 BC and AD 900. Under this scenario, population movement
 into the Middle Atlantic region and the Chesapeake occurred during the Middle
 Woodland. Protowords for town, chief, ceremonial attendant, and fellow clan

 member also occur across different Algonquian languages, implying that traditional
 social structures included large villages, totemic clans, ranked lineages, and
 hereditary chiefs (Fiedel 1994).

 Fiedel's reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian and his use of glottochronology are

 by no means universally accepted. This is partly due to processual archaeologists'
 general distaste for migration as an explanatory tool (Cobb 2005, p. 565), though
 other serious questions do arise. Stone tool technologies, pottery styles, and
 mortuary practices frequently crossed social and linguistic boundaries within the
 Chesapeake during the contact period, making it difficult to isolate evidence of
 migration in the archaeological record, particularly prior to contact. The spread of

 shell tempering across the Chesapeake may, in fact, result from adaptive adv antages

 inherent in this production method. Darwinian archaeologists also have highlighted

 problems of essentialism inherent in the use of culture-historic taxa (e.g., Kipp
 Island phase) as direct correlates of ethnic or language groups in the Middle Atlantic
 (Hart and Brumbach 2003, p. 750). Some historical linguists (e.g., Campbell 2004,
 pp. 200-210) doubt the efficacy of glottochronology's methodological and
 analytical principles, particularly in the absence of other corroborating evidence.
 Nonetheless, glottochronology does play a role in recent studies of migration (e.g.,
 Bellwood and Renfrew 2002) and the spread of domesticates (e.g., Brown 2006)
 that combine archaeological, biological, and linguistic data sets.

 On the whole, Fiedel's linguistic analysis provides an intriguing line of evidence
 with which to consider the c. AD 200 "Mockley spread" and the subsequent
 appearance of ceremonial centers (e.g., Stewart 1998b), earthwork enclosures (e.g.,
 Gallivan 2007), and chiefly lineages (e.g., Woodard 2008) in the Chesapeake.
 Moreover, as archaeologists develop detailed late prehistoric sequences in the
 Eastern Woodlands, migration is emerging as a "viable alternative" to explanations
 rooted in "gradualist assumptions" about culture change in the region (Snow 1995,
 p. 59). Efforts to develop more nuanced models of population movements that draw
 from ethnohistorical analysis and detailed archaeological sequences also are
 beginning to appear in the Chesapeake (e.g., Dent 2005), adding to the growing
 body of studies that draw on migration, conflict, and long-range interaction to
 explain culture change in the precontact Eastern Woodlands (e.g., Nassaney and
 Sassaman 1995).

 Cordage twist direction as reflected in ceramic surface treatments offers a

 potentially useful method for detecting population movements in the Chesapeake.
 Once learned, cordage twist direction usually remains unchanged throughout a
 person's lifetime, so patterning in this attribute may be interpreted as the product of
 different learning networks of weaver-potters (Carr and Maslowski 1995, p. 321).
 Johnson and Speedy (1992) proposed that abrupt changes in cordage twist at the end of

 the Middle Woodland paralleled the migration of new populations along the coastal
 James. Complicating such evidence though is the possibility that learning networks
 during late precontact centuries were shaped by increased sedentism and resulting

 social boundaries rather than by population movements (Klein 2003b). When sample
 sizes are small or the ceramics come from temporally mixed deposits, it also can be
 difficult to rule out the impact of handedness on cordage twist (Custer 2004).

 Studies that have posited evidence of a Middle Woodland Algonquian intrusion
 into the Chesapeake region have been conducted at the Island Field site (Custer
 et al. 1990) and at the Ramp 3 site in Washington, DC (Knepper et al. 2006).
 Beginning in 1968, excavations at the Island Field site near the Delaware Bay
 identified several hundred burials dating from AD 410 to 1180 (Custer et al. 1990,
 p. 200). Sections of these burial grounds were incorporated into an on-site museum
 that publicly displayed human remains and associated grave goods. Protests by the
 Nanticoke tribal leadership led to analysis and reburial of the remains. This study
 produced several significant archaeological results and contributed to a reorientation
 of Delaware archaeological practices toward the inclusion of descendant commu
 nities (Custer 2005; Petraglia and Cunningham 2006). The site also exhibited traits
 associated with the Kipp Island phase of the Point Peninsula complex (AD
 500-800), including ceramics, grave good assemblages, and mortuary patterns
 (Ritchie 1994). Centered in New York and Ontario, Kipp Island-related sites also
 have been identified in New Jersey, Delaware, and Virginia. The mortuary complex
 at the Island Field site appeared at a time of other discontinuities in ceramics,

 settlement, and exchange patterns in Delaware, prompting Custer and colleagues
 (1990, p. 207) to posit that the site records a migration of Algonquian speakers into
 the region.

 Research on the Potomac River's inner coastal plain has brought to light
 additional evidence of relationships between Chesapeake communities of the

 terminal Middle Woodland and peoples and practices to the north. Knepper and
 colleagues (2006, pp. 204-206) identified a feature at the Ramp 3 site in
 Washington, DC, containing an antler comb, antler disks, perforated shark teeth,
 groundstone pendants, a stone phallic effigy, a wooden bead, and charred textile
 fragments, materials also associated with the Kipp Island tradition (Fig. 2). The
 Kipp Island connection may correspond with the spread of Algonquian cultures
 through the Middle Atlantic and into the Chesapeake from the Northeast during the
 Middle Woodland (Knepper et al. 2006, p. 235). Extending these ideas, Potter
 (1999) has suggested that the mortuary ceremonialism at Ramp 3 and related sites
 represented "route markers" for Middle Woodland Algonquian immigrants moving
 south. The identified materials do indeed represent linkages to communities and
 practices north of the Chesapeake at a time when shell-tempered ceramics spread
 rapidly across the region. By the Late Woodland, the archaeological record of these
 populations may be seen in the distribution of Townsend complex sites surrounding
 the Chesapeake Bay and in the closely related Colington complex of the Carolina
 sounds region.

 Research on the James-York Peninsula has offered evidence that beginning at the
 time of these postulated population movements, hunter-foragers from distinct
 traditions coexisted and interacted, perhaps for as long as several centuries (Blanton
 and Pullins 2004, pp. 89-91). Grit-tempered Varina and Prince George ceramics
 have a long history in the area, most often on interior sites that lack midden

 deposits. Shell-tempered Mockley ceramics appear after AD 200 and generally
 occur at midden sites in estuarine locations. Such differences in pottery production
 techniques may simply correspond to the tempering agents available to hunter
 forager groups in different parts of a settlement round, though there are other
 indications that the pattern relates to two distinct social traditions that came into
 contact c. AD 200. While either Mockley ceramics or grit-tempered pottery
 dominated each assemblage, ceramics from both wares co-occur in feature deposits
 (Blanton and Pullins 2004, p. 78). The evidence raises the possibility that "a
 Mockley-using population emerged, coexisted for a time with already-present
 Varina/Prince George ceramic users, and then effectively replaced the latter
 population" (Blanton and Pullins 2004, p. 88). Mockley vessels on interior sites and
 deer bone in estuarine shell middens point to exchange, intermarriage, and the
 "mutualism" of Middle Woodland hunter-foragers in the area (Blanton and Pullins
 2004, p. 91).

 Prompted as much by new evidence as by a theoretical reorientation, Middle

 Woodland research in the Chesapeake is now more open to interpretive frames that
 foreground population movements, powerful places, and local histories of social
 interaction. A recent study pushes the boundaries of this interpretive trend and
 postulates that Middle Woodland mortuary centers near the Potomac River fall line
 may be best understood best in terms of Algonquian cultural landscapes (Knepper
 et al. 2006, pp. 236-243). Drawing from characterizations of Eastern Algonquian
 cosmology and a view-shed analysis, Knepper et al. (2006, p. 238) suggest that
 "beyond general strategic advantage, the river terraces would have represented
 favorable, even propitious symbolic locations, particularly for mortuary purposes,
 being near water and exhibiting commanding unobstructed paths for the dead."
 Whether all researchers agree with this interpretation, it is clear that Middle
 Woodland archaeology will continue to benefit from studies aimed at tracing the
 social construction of places and landscapes.

 Late Woodland period

 The Late Woodland period (AD 900-1600) has been the focus of archaeological
 research in the Chesapeake that traces the settlement of large, permanent towns, the
 adoption of horticulture, and the emergence of chiefly political structures. Recent
 studies have considered the implications of boundary formation, warfare, and
 mortuary ritual, while in the process highlighting the political dynamics behind the
 emergence of chiefdoms documented by European colonists. The ability to
 construct narrative histories of these polities that reach well into the precontact era
 heightens the broader significance of the Chesapeake's Late Woodland record.

 Many Late Woodland studies have aimed at producing "an understanding of the

 evolutionary processes that transformed Early and Middle Woodland societies of
 the Middle Atlantic into the cultures observed at the time of European Contact"
 (Custer 1986, p. 9). The archaeology of hierarchical societies in the Chesapeake—
 including the Powhatan, Monacan, Piscataway, Patawomeke, and Nanticoke—has
 emphasized explanations whereby Middle Woodland (500 BC-AD 900) "harvesters

 of the Chesapeake" increased in population, developed circumscribed social
 networks, and became Late Woodland (AD 900-1500) village horticulturalists
 (Potter 1993, p. 139; see also Binford 1964; Turner 1976). Binford's (1964) seminal
 study provided foundations for this effort by combining ecological parameters,
 settlement patterns, and ethnohistorical interpretation. Potter's (1982, 1993)
 analyses of Algonquian cultural development in the Potomac contributed a richly
 textured local context for tracing the history of a Native American group. In a series
 of publications emphasizing environmental productivity, demography, and neo
 evolutionary models, Turner (1976, 1992, 1993) has linked Tidewater archaeology
 to Powhatan ethnohistory. Rountree and Turner's (2002) interpretation of the
 Powhatan chiefdom as a pyramidal political structure comprising the paramount
 chief who dominated the Tidewater region, weroances who controlled regional
 districts, councilors who influenced weroances, and commoners who paid tribute
 remains the region's standard sociopolitical model.

 More recent research has added to and, at times, challenged these studies by

 emphasizing regional diversity, social conflict, the symbolic and political force of
 ritual, and the movement of people and material across the landscape. Stewart's
 (1993) comparison of Late Woodland societies in the Delaware, Potomac, and
 Susquehanna valleys builds on an earlier comparative study (Custer 1986) that
 emphasized regional variability. The role of cultigens varied widely in this area, as
 did community patterns that included dispersed hamlets, palisaded villages, and
 nucleated towns. Broad ecological factors account for few Late Woodland
 developments, Stewart (1993, p. 163) argues, whereas regional interaction played
 a prominent role in the configuration and transformation of societies across the
 Middle Atlantic. For example, Stewart notes that the absence of defensive
 communities, settlement nucleation, and population displacements in the Delaware
 Valley may have resulted from relationships between communities there and Owasco

 societies to the north. The archaeology offers indications that the historic-era role
 played by the Lenape as middlemen between Iroquois and Algonquian groups may
 have also existed during the Late Woodland period, structuring historical develop
 ments in the Delaware Valley (Stewart 1993, p. 173, 1998b, p. 177).

 Where researchers do foreground the environmental and geographic parameters

 of Late Woodland social histories, there is a turn toward detailed studies of local

 settings and a serious consideration of the reciprocal relationship between natural
 and cultural landscapes (e.g., Blanton et al. 2005; Rice 2009). A recent study of
 Potomac Valley history probes the relationship between long-term environmental

 history and local culture history by tracing developments in the drainage from the
 earliest native settlement through the 18th century (Rice 2009). In his effort to
 explain why parts of the Potomac River basin were uninhabited on the eve of
 colonization, Rice (2009, pp. 7-10) emphasizes three related narratives that
 unfolded in the region: the changing relationship between environmental conditions

 and cultural adaptations, the history of Native American social interaction, and the
 social implications of landscapes constructed by previous generations. Rice (2009,

 p. 255) argues persuasively that the precontact transition to horticulture resulted in
 demographic patterns among native societies that influenced the early history of
 colonial settlement and subsequent patterns of agrarian and urban development.

 A comprehensive survey on the James-York Peninsula documented local
 environmental conditions and cyclical changes in settlement that culminated with

 the development of the Kiskiak polity, one of the communities encompassed within
 the Powhatan chiefdom by 1607 (Blanton et al. 2005, p. 238). Settlements dating
 after AD 1300 record a sharp population increase and a shift to dispersed
 communities comprising small, distinct enclaves. Such settlements, including the
 village of Kiskiak, were well positioned to take advantage of the richest estuarine
 resources rather than areas with particularly productive soils for agriculture. Maize
 and other domesticates were incorporated quite late, likely during the 16th century,
 and even then played a modest role in subsistence. The research calls into question
 approaches that rely on coarse-grained models of Chesapeake cultural ecology
 (Blanton et al. 2005, pp. 238-240), indicating that understanding the emergence of
 chiefly political structures will require close attention to local histories, diverse
 environmental settings, and distinct economic practices.

 Recent, large-scale excavations have documented Late Woodland community
 forms. My own study (Gallivan 2003) of James River settlements identified changes
 in domestic production, community organization, and regional exchange that
 coincided with the establishment of large and permanent village communities
 between AD 1200 and 1500. The arrangement of features within domestic spaces
 suggests that households increased in size and began to exert greater control over
 the storage of food during this period. Select communities across the drainage
 erected palisades and began to use large roasting pits for multicommunity feasts.

 Ceramic styles reflected social networks that were considerably more bounded after
 AD 1200. These changes, I have argued, resulted in a riverine landscape susceptible
 to the rise of chiefly political structures.

 As referenced above, researchers at the Potomac Creek and Accokeek Creek sites

 in the Potomac River's inner coastal plain see evidence of population movements,
 fortification, and mortuary centers (e.g., Blanton et al. 1999, Dent and Jirikowic
 2001). Both sites exhibit concentric ditch features and multiple palisade lines
 surrounding a plaza with ossuaries and primary interments (T. Stewart 1992). Potter
 (1993, pp. 126-148) has elegantly framed competing hypotheses for the origins of
 the Potomac Creek complex in terms of a piedmont emigration, an Eastern Shore
 homeland, and in situ development. He argues in favor of a scenario in which
 piedmont migrants from the Montgomery complex established the Potomac Creek
 and Accokeek Creek villages during the 14th century AD. Blanton et al. (1999,
 p. 102) also see evidence of population movement behind Potomac Creek but point
 to Owasco origins farther to the north.

 Closely related to these developments, Late Woodland archaeology in the
 Potomac piedmont reveals heightened social conflict after AD 1200 in the form of
 palisaded settlements, cultural disjunctures, and village abandonments (e.g., Dent
 2005, Jirikowic 1995; MacCord et al. 1957). Montgomery complex villages were
 abandoned c. AD 1400 with the arrival of settlers from the Keyser complex (Dent
 2005, p. 46). Jirikowic's (1995) study of the Hughes site, a Keyser village, traces the
 history of an economically self-sufficient and apparently egalitarian community
 whose mortuary rituals signaled distinct lineages marked by social distance.
 The Potomac Valley emerges from this research as a highly fluid landscape: "New

 groups arrived, old groups dispersed, and diverse people coalesced and defined
 themselves" (Dent 2005, p. 47). Rather than movements of entire communities en
 masse, there are hints that the Middle Potomac's archaeology records "serial
 migrations" (Bernardini 2005, p. 15) whereby individuals, families, or lineages
 moved across the landscape, establishing new settlements in some places and testing
 the hospitality of existing communities in others (Dent 2005, p. 47). The resulting
 communities are likely to have been multilingual places with considerable social
 diversity (Dent 2005, p. 47; Moore 1993).

 South of the Potomac, most Late Woodland settlements in the Chesapeake were
 large, dispersed communities located near rivers and arranged around wetlands and
 embayed areas (Turner and Opperman 1993). Excavations in the Chickahominy
 drainage have offered a sense of Virginia Algonquian settlement forms during the
 Late Woodland period that include small farmsteads and dispersed villages
 containing several ossuaries (Gallivan et al. 2009; McCary and Barka 1977).
 Several unusual Late Woodland settlements also appeared along the Chickahominy
 River. The Clark's Old Neck site features massive roasting pits, debris from large
 scale food preparation events, and highly decorated pottery. The Buck Farm site is
 defined by trenches and palisades surrounding a compact, 200-m2 area that
 contained several animal burials, a unique arrangement pointing to the special
 nature of the settlement (Fig. 3). Ethnohistorical parallels raise the possibility that
 the site represents a 16th-century Chickahominy quioccosan, or priestly compound
 (Shephard 2008). Together, the sites excavated by the Chickahominy River Survey
 offer anchor points for a narrative that includes dispersed farmsteads, feasting
 locales, and a palisaded compound. The survey records the emergence of a Late
 Woodland landscape after AD 1100 comprising residential communities as well as

 places that were important to social solidarity and community construction. In short,

 we see hints of the built environments, imagined communities, and lived spaces
 through which the residents of the river drainage became the Chickahominies
 (Gallivan 2009).

 In contrast with the settlements along the Chickahominy, which reflect
 continuous use of Townsend ceramics from AD 800 through the 17th century,
 palisaded settlements that appeared along the James River during the 14th century
 are generally associated with Roanoke and Gaston ceramics linked to North
 Carolina traditions (Turner 1993). Near the mouth of the James, excavations at the

 Great Neck site identified a 16th-century palisaded settlement with an unusually
 large longhouse structure and burials with associated copper grave goods (Hodges
 1998). The settlement, likely a political center tied to the Chesapeake Indians,
 contained both Roanoke and Townsend ceramics. The size, condition, and context
 of the ceramics at Great Neck suggest that that the 16th-century Roanoke
 occupation replaced an earlier Townsend component, possibly corresponding to
 colonial accounts of precontact warfare between Algonquian groups and subsequent
 population replacement (Hodges 1998, pp. 195-198).

 Studies of Chesapeake subsistence are quite limited (Barfield and Barber 1992),

 particularly prior to the Late Woodland period, though several do call into question
 a uniform transition to maize-based horticulture. Bioarchaeological analysis in
 nearby coastal North Carolina indicates that groups there relied on maritime

 resources without adopting corn during the Late Woodland (Hutchinson 2002). A
 similar study of Virginia piedmont burial mounds (Gold 2004) identified a pattern of
 local autonomy among Late Woodland villages reliant on maize farming and wild
 food resources. Changes in Middle to Late Woodland faunal assemblages suggest a
 focus on deer and riverine resources (Levine 2006), whereas deer procurement
 strategies intensified even further at the Chesapeake's western and northern margins
 to supply the early colonial market for hides (Fausz 1988; Lapham 2004).
 Archaeobotanical analysis has documented considerable regional variability in Late
 Woodland subsistence (Gallivan and McKnight 2008; McKnight and Gallivan
 2007), including patterns west of the Blue Ridge Mountains that conform to the
 model for North America's middle-latitude riverine zone where the domestication

 of native starchy and oily seed-bearing plants appeared during the Late Archaic.
 East of the Blue Ridge, there is no convincing evidence of horticulture prior to the
 sporadic archaeological appearance of maize c. AD 1100. This pattern places the
 Chesapeake within a broader geographic zone lacking pre-maize agriculture that
 runs along the Atlantic seaboard (Gremillion 2002, p. 490). The distribution of the
 earliest maize in the region suggests episodic incorporation into select communities
 across the Chesapeake. Maize was apparently adopted by people who did not
 participate in the pre-maize Eastern Agriculture complex and, perhaps, not primarily

 to fill a dietary "need." Several of the sites with the earliest maize are places of
 seasonal aggregation, large-scale food consumption events, and burial grounds.
 Archaeobotanical patterning pointing to maize's use in ritual contexts has been
 identified at the western edge of the Chesapeake (VanDerwarker and Idol 2008);
 such practices also may have been at work east of the Blue Ridge after AD 1100.
 A considerable body of research has illuminated Late Woodland cultural
 boundaries and social interaction across them. In coastal Virginia, the increasingly
 limited distribution of Late Woodland ceramic wares marks rising territoriality

 related to the emergence of regionally distinct native polities (Turner 1993). Several
 scholars have identified evidence of Late Woodland interaction across the fall line, a

 division that separated coastal Algonquians from interior Siouan groups during the
 early colonial era. The fall line may have comprised a deer exploitation area
 between these groups (Turner 1978), a political buffer against armed conflict
 between the Powhatans and the Monacans (Mouer 1983), a frontier of interaction
 and periodic occupation by groups from both sides (Egloff 1989), or a place of
 exchange through which prestige items flowed (Hantman 1990). Placing such
 interaction in a broader, regional and historical context, Hantman (1990) has
 suggested that Algonquian-Siouan interaction across the fall line played a
 fundamental role in shaping Native American political strategies during the early
 colonial era. To the north, the Potomac River fall line represented a conduit for
 migrating populations at the end of the Middle Woodland period and a boundary
 area visited by diverse groups during the Late Woodland (Knepper et al. 2006,
 p. 231).

 In a study of the decorative motifs and "grammars" of Late Woodland ceramic

 designs, Custer (1989a, pp. 308-311) proposed that a cultural boundary separated
 language groups and interaction spheres in the northern Delmarva-southeastern
 Pennsylvania area. The two distinct zones correspond with the Minguannan
 archaeological complex and the Shenks Ferry complex. This boundary, which
 emerged at the outset of the Late Woodland period, paralleled the division between
 coastal Algonquians and interior Iroquoian and Siouan groups. Custer (1987b, p. 23)
 sees evidence in the distribution of design grammars of a broad belt of Iroquoian/
 Eastern Siouan speakers in the central Middle Atlantic and a north-to-south
 migration of Algonquian speakers down the Middle Atlantic coast. Petroglyphs on
 the lower Susquehanna associated with Minguannan communities appear to have
 reinforced this Late Woodland cultural boundary (Custer 1989b).

 Building on earlier characterizations of Southside Virginia's Late Woodland
 archaeology (Hodges 1998; Phelps 1983; Turner 1993), a recent study has suggested
 that the area between the Chesapeake and the Albemarle drainages represented

 often-violent borderlands between culturally distinct traditions from AD 1400 to the
 17th century (Gallivan et al. 2008). By the early colonial era this region was home
 to rival Algonquian weroances, powerful Iroquoian traders, Siouan cultural
 influences, as well as people and objects that moved across these communities
 and categories. During the Late Woodland period, towns in the region were
 surrounded by palisades with a greater frequency than communities to the north.
 The archaeological record points to social practices—notably simple stamping of
 ceramics, the use of communal ossuary burial features, and exchange in rare objects
 of body adornment—that crossed cultural and linguistic boundaries. Several
 Southside settlements dating to this period appear to represent multilingual
 communities. Other sites provide evidence of the violence, warfare, and population
 replacement that characterized the borderlands on the eve of contact. Both
 documentary and archaeological evidence indicates that the Powhatan chiefdom,
 which emerged during the 16th century, was shaped by these social dynamics on the

 southern edge of the Chesapeake region.

 Analysis of ossuaries and communal mound burial practices of the Late
 Woodland have illuminated demographic patterns, subsistence practices, and the
 symbolic and political dimensions of mortuary ritual (e.g., Blick 2000; Curry 1999;
 Dunham 1999; Dunham et al. 2003; Gold 2004; Jirikowic 1990, 1995; Shaffer

 2005). Ossuary burial in the coastal Chesapeake involved collective, secondary
 deposits of human remains, typically after initial processing of bodies elsewhere.
 For the Nanticokes, remains interred in ossuaries were sometimes moved when a

 community was displaced during the colonial era (Shaffer 2005). Potomac ossuaries
 were often quite large, sometimes containing hundreds of disarticulated remains
 (Curry 1999). By contrast, ossuaries to the south in coastal Virginia generally
 contained a much smaller number of individuals, pointing to differences in mortuary
 practices, social organization, and population densities (Blick 2000). Researchers
 have noted parallels between Chesapeake ossuaries and the Huron Feast of the
 Dead, a periodic ceremony in which the remains of the deceased were gathered from
 several communities and interred collectively amid feasting and ritual (Curry 1999).
 With their inclusivity and uniform treatment of the dead, Tidewater ossuary
 burials appear to be remarkably egalitarian, yet, as Jirikowic (1990, p. 370) suggests

 "this negation of individuality and the elaboration of collective unity and continuity
 illustrate how mortuary rituals may create the illusory natural and eternal order
 which is maintained by 'traditional authority.' " In a similar way, piedmont burial

 mounds marked by uniform treatment of the dead may record a hierarchical political
 order, with power manifested in historical associations between ancestors and
 territory (Dunham et al. 2003; Hantman 1990, p. 684). Dunham (1999, p. 128) reads
 Monacan burial mounds in terms of a ritual process shaped by tropes, symbolic
 constructs that established a triadic relation between mounds, territories, and social

 groups: "By subsuming the randomness of death itself within a predictable and
 regulated framework, the collective mortuary sequence would have effectively
 functioned as a 'time-space organizing device.' "

 Studies of Late Woodland mortuary practices in the post-NAGPRA era also open

 new possibilities for expanded engagement between archaeologists and contempo
 rary native communities while bringing to the fore disagreements concerning

 cultural affiliation and archaeological prerogatives. A study of Virginia burial
 mounds (Dunham et al. 2003; Hantman et al. 2004) has established that a

 connection between the mounds and the contemporary Monacans of central Virginia
 is most "parsimoniously concordant" with the archaeological and documentary
 evidence, whereas Boyd (2004b) has countered that the mounds cannot be
 associated confidently with any known Native American group. Another recent

 study, prompted by a repatriation request from the Nansemond tribe, has concluded
 that human remains from the 17th-century Hand site located on the Nottoway River
 in Virginia exhibit more affinities with Iroquoian practices than with those
 associated with the Nansemonds' Algonquian ancestors (Mudar et al. 1998).

 Clearly each of these positions has substantial consequences for archaeologists
 and for descendant communities. The interpretation of Hand site burials as
 Iroquoian is based on the presence of cremations, bundle burials, and primary
 interments containing associated grave gods, a pattern that contrasts with mortuary
 evidence from Algonquian sites that generally include ossuaries with few if any
 related grave goods. While elegant, this interpretation relies on a rather monolithic
 characterization of Algonquian burial practices, which at times included primary
 interments and bundle burials alongside ossuaries. Native history during the 17th
 century also complicates the effort to assign a cultural affiliation to the Hand site, as

 one group of Nansemonds responded to colonial violence by moving nearby to the
 Nottoway River where they lived for a time alongside Iroquoian speakers (Vest
 2003, p. 790). In addition to the complicated histories of multilingual, coalescent
 communities, bioarchaeologists seeking to retain access to human remains also must
 navigate the political aspirations of contemporary descendant communities seeking
 to reassert a measure of control over ancestors' remains. Determining the cultural

 affiliation of human remains in the Chesapeake, as elsewhere, is clearly fraught with

 a number of serious challenges.

 Early colonial period

 Studies of the Chesapeake contact period, more accurately termed the early colonial
 era (Silliman 2005), have benefitted from long-standing interest in the Powhatan
 chiefdom of Tidewater Virginia and from new approaches to archaeological and
 ethnohistorical interpretation. Wide-ranging analyses of the Atlantic seaboard at
 contact have demonstrated ways that the native societies of the Chesapeake were
 implicated in broader social networks and historical dynamics (Grumet 1995;
 Hatfield 2004; Loren 2008). New and recently annotated editions of colonists'
 accounts from the early colonial era, including those emanating from Jamestown,
 have been published in recent decades, providing a documentary foundation for
 contact-period archaeology (e.g., Grumet 2001; Haile 1998; Sloan 2007; Smith and
 Barbour 1986; Smith and Home 2007). Studies of historic cartography, including
 John Smith's Map of Virginia, have provided a geographic framework for
 understanding native settlement locations (e.g., Turner and Opperman 1993),
 political geographies (Gallivan 1997; Potter 2009), colonial strategies of appropri
 ation (Harley 1992; Hatfield 2003), contact-period semiotics (Boelhower 2003), and

 native toponymy (Potter 2002). Several small-scale excavations conducted prior to
 1990 identified evidence of European trade items in Native American contexts that
 date to the protohistoric 16th century and the early 17th-century contact period
 (Hodges 1993). More recently, intensive survey (e.g., Blanton et al. 2005; Brown
 and Horning 2006) and excavation (e.g., Busby n.d.; Gallivan et al. 2005; Luccketti
 1994; McLearan and Mouer 1994) have expanded the available evidence
 considerably. Excavations at James Fort (Kelso 2006) and the commemoration of

 the 400th anniversary of Jamestown's settlement have focused on early encounters
 between native societies and English colonists in the Chesapeake, while also
 drawing attention to the contemporary ramifications of early colonial history in the
 Chesapeake (Gleach 2003; Hantman 2008; Horning 2006a).

 As one of the original locations of an English colonial presence in North
 America, the Chesapeake has long been a primary region for the development of
 historical archaeology in the Americanist tradition. The significance of colonial-era
 archaeology in the Chesapeake has become thornier in recent years, though, as
 archaeological and ethnohistorical studies have introduced native histories that
 complicate narratives of English colonial triumph. Anglocentric perspectives have
 long shaped historians' coverage of the early colonial Chesapeake, while an
 "artificial divide" continues to separate most historical archaeology from Native
 American history (King and Chaney 2004). The resulting "blind spot" in early
 colonial studies (Mouer et al. 1999) has persisted in the Chesapeake long after
 programmatic statements calling attention to it elsewhere (e.g., Lightfoot 1995). A
 number of recent studies have challenged this divide and critically interrogated
 colonial sources with archaeological evidence (e.g., Davidson 2004; Galke 2004;
 Mallios 2006). The most salient thread running through these studies is the
 recognition that Native American actors in the Chesapeake adopted highly varied
 strategies in the face of the colonial encounter. These strategies drew on deep
 histories of place and landscape (e.g., Gallivan 2007), indigenous cosmologies and
 systems of meaning (e.g., Waselkov 2006), and structural principles originating
 centuries before English colonists even saw the Chesapeake (e.g., Scarry and
 Maxham 2002). Perhaps the most significant contribution of recent archaeological
 studies of the Chesapeake contact period is the addition of a geographically broader
 and temporally deeper perspective that "raises questions about the commonplace
 categories embedded" within the maps and written sources of the colonial era
 (Klein and Sanford 2004, p. 72).

 Chesapeake contact-period studies typically draw on these documentary sources
 as a point of departure, though the narratives and maps are read in rather distinct
 ways. Some researchers reconstruct an ethnographic present on the eve of contact

 that encapsulates the social structures of native societies (e.g., Feest 1990; Rountree
 1989; Rountree and Turner 2002). Others emphasize a narrative flow of events
 surrounding early European settlement in an effort to extricate the histories of native

 communities that are overshadowed by English perspectives (e.g., Axtell 2001;
 Kupperman 2007; Rice 2007; Rountree 1990). Still others draw from developments

 in historical anthropology, emphasizing that culture is a historical product and that
 history is culturally ordered (e.g., Sahlins 2004). These approaches start with the
 premise that Native American actions during the early colonial era accorded with

 deeply rooted cultural structures (Williamson 1992, pp. 368-369) and that several
 layers of interpretation, including linguistic, religious, and ideological, need to be
 considered when assessing early encounters (Haefeli 2007, p. 409; Kupperman
 2000). For example, a recent study probes the relationship between priestly
 authority and chiefly power among Virginia Algonquians, demonstrating ways that
 ritual and cosmology framed the structures of Powhatan leadership (Williamson
 2003). Another study, an "ethno-ethnohistory," identifies culturally informed
 strategies on the part of both the Powhatans and the English, suggesting that both
 sought to "civilize" the other (Gleach 1997). Analysis of exchange involving
 Jamestown colonists, an earlier Spanish mission, and the Roanoke Colony indicates
 that Europeans repeatedly violated indigenous gift-exchange rules and in the
 process provoked native hostilities (Mallios 2006). Chesapeake colonial history also
 highlights strategies employed by Native American elites to reproduce their status, a
 process constrained by "prior practice and established patterns of discourse"
 (Scarry and Maxham 2002, p. 168). Complex kinship structures that are masked
 behind English depictions of Powhatan society also played a role in framing
 colonial Chesapeake history (Woodard 2008).

 Recent archaeological investigations of contact-period sites that offer a
 complementary line of evidence include excavations of several sites at Jordan's
 Point on the James that have identified an early 17th-century English settlement
 superimposed above a 16th-century native settlement (McLearan and Mouer 1994).
 The Jordan's Point sites graphically record the colonial English strategy of
 establishing plantations on prime agricultural land that had been cleared and farmed
 by native communities (Potter and Waselkov 1994). Investigations at the mouth of
 the Chickahominy have uncovered a Paspahegh settlement dating to the early years
 of the Jamestown Colony (Luccketti 1994). Located five miles from Jamestown, the

 settlement features the material record of a group under Powhatan's influence living

 in close proximity to Jamestown. The native community interacted intensively with
 the colonists, as reflected in the written accounts and in the presence of European

 copper artifacts in burial contexts. Recent investigations on the York River (Blanton
 et al. 2005) have identified similar materials at the Kiskiak site, including sheet
 copper, lead shot, and English flint fragments, that originated from Jamestown.

 Excavations at the Werowocomoco site on the York River coastal plain identified
 a dispersed village dating from the 13th century through contact (Gallivan et al.
 2005). Werowocomoco was the Powhatan political center and the scene of early
 colonial encounters. The settlement included two distinct zones: a residential area

 lining the river and an interior area marked by concentric ditches constructed from
 AD 1300 to 1500. The interior area contained a high percentage of nonlocal
 ceramics and serving vessels near a large structure associated with Wahunsenacawh,
 paramount of the Powhatan chiefdom. Trade copper from Jamestown also appears
 in 17th-century deposits surrounding the structure. Drawing on social theories of
 landscape and "place-making" (e.g., Basso 1996, p. 5), my colleagues and I have
 suggested that Werowocomoco was redefined as a ritualized and politicized node
 within a landscape of similar such places constructed by Algonquian communities
 across the Chesapeake after AD 1200 (Gallivan 2007). The process of place-making
 at Werowocomoco likely played a role in the development of social ranking in the

 Chesapeake after AD 1300 and in the 16th-century origins of the Powhatan
 chiefdom.

 No discussion of the contact-period Chesapeake would be complete without
 mention of the excavations conducted at James Fort (Kelso 2006). Most relevant to

 the history of Native American-Anglo interaction are deposits from the Fort period
 (1607-1623) that contrast with Post-Fort period (1624-1660) contexts (Mallios and
 Straube 2000, p. 27). Fort-period features contain copper, glass beads, and wild
 fauna. Roughly half of the pottery from Fort-period deposits is Native American.
 The Fort-period assemblage matches a record of regular, bilateral exchanges
 involving the movement of copper and glass beads to native communities, while
 ceramic vessels (containing food) and wild fauna flowed from Native Americans to
 the colonists (Mallios and Straube 2000, p. 29). Subsequently, exchange relations
 became unidirectional as food moved from native communities into the fort while

 few trade goods moved in the opposite direction.

 Copper clearly played a critical role in early colonial interaction in the
 Chesapeake. The recent identification of scrap copper at Jamestown (Kelso 2006,
 p. 179) and of Jamestown copper at native sites on the James (Fleming and Swann
 1994) and the York (Hudgins 2004) offers avenues for evaluating colonial-era
 interaction and native systems of meaning. As a symbol and source of power that
 circulated through ritualized exchange spheres, copper played a key role in native
 religious and political structures (Hantman 1990). The inundation of copper in the
 Chesapeake following Wahunsenacawh's 1609 departure from Werowocomoco
 undermined these authority structures and contributed to contact-period social
 havoc (Blanton and Hudgins 2005; Hudgins 2004; Potter 2006).

 Providing a climatalogical context for early colonial interaction, another study
 has demonstrated that the worst droughts of the past 800 years coincided with the
 failures of the 16th-century Roanoke Colony and the early 17th-century "starving
 time" at Jamestown (Blanton 2000). Bald cypress trees from the Dismal Swamp
 provided the basis for an annual temperature and precipitation history from AD
 1185 to 1984 (Stahle et al. 1998). This record suggests that extreme drought was a
 factor in the Roanoke Colony's failure and in Jamestown's early struggles. Spanish
 Jesuit missionaries' descriptions of Virginia in 1570 as a land "chastened" with
 famine and death allude to the serious impact of periodic droughts (Lewis and
 Loomie 1953, p. 89). The tree-ring research also indicates that year-to-year
 climatalogical variation has long characterized the Chesapeake, fluctuation that
 required native societies to develop social means of alleviating resource shortfalls.

 Researchers have considered the potential impact of protohistoric epidemics

 introduced by European forays into the Chesapeake on the region's early colonial
 history (Rountree 1990, pp. 128-130; Rountree and Turner 2002, p. 32). Barker
 (1992) has even suggested that protohistoric depopulation triggered by European
 introduced epidemics was a factor in the emergence of the Powhatan political
 economy. Under this scenario, the curtailed tribute available from a declining
 population prompted military expansion by Algonquian chiefs, including Wahun
 senacawh, who sought to expand their influence over greater numbers of
 communities. Diseases introduced by colonists, including smallpox, also may have
 contributed to the disintegration of the Powhatan social order after Jamestown's

 settlement (Mann 2007). Native disease is indeed documented during the 17th
 century, following intensive colonial interaction (Rice 2009, pp. 131-134), whereas
 Native American references to precolonial diseases are equivocal (Rountree 1989,
 pp. 141-142). Bioarchaeological evidence of Chesapeake pandemics preceding
 colonial settlement has not been identified, and systematic research in adjacent areas

 indicates that widespread disease and death either followed direct contact (Ward and
 Davis 1991) or was largely absent (Gagnon 2004). Even with uncertainty in the
 Chesapeake's bioarchaeological evidence, the dramatic contrast between the
 population of Virginia Algonquians c. 1607 (Turner 1982) and during the 18th
 century (Jefferson 1787) indicates that colonial-era disease, enslavement, and
 violence each had a substantial and tragic impact on native history (Hantman in
 press).

 Chesapeake archaeologists have recently begun to integrate the study of native
 settlements and interaction between Native Americans and newcomers more fully
 into the comparative archaeology of the 17th-century Chesapeake and the history of
 the Atlantic world (King and Chaney 2004). Reanalysis of the Camden site located
 on the Rappahannock River and the Posey site on the Potomac has revealed ways
 that native households participated in trade networks and incorporated European
 goods (Porter 2006, pp. 68-72). These sites highlight alternative choices made by
 native households in the Chesapeake and ways that European materials were
 incorporated into traditional native practices and exchange spheres (Galke 2004).
 Other native sites from the colonial era lack European materials altogether (e.g.,
 Stewart 1999), highlighting the range of social strategies adopted by Native
 Americans.

 Sites such as Posey and Camden dating to the later 17th century often feature
 low-fired earthenware, "colonoware," that played a role in interactions involving
 Indians, English colonists, and enslaved Africans (Henry 1992; Noel Hume 1962).
 Historical archaeologists have focused on the close association between colono
 ceramics and enslaved Africans (e.g., Deetz 1993, p. 80), though colono ceramics
 also were produced by Pamunkeys, Rappahannocks, and other native groups who
 marketed them to colonists (Atkins 2009a; Potter 1993, pp. 224-228). Mouer and
 colleagues (1999) have shifted discussions of colonoware and related materials in
 fruitful directions by turning away from an older focus on the ceramic as an identity
 marker and toward the colonial "creolization" process that crossed social and ethnic

 categories. A potential problem inherent in this emphasis on creolization, though, is
 its tendency to mask the violence, conflict, and differences of power inherent in the
 colonial Chesapeake behind a focus on blended material culture, unifying practices,

 and the ethnogenesis of new peoples (Horning 2006b, p. 199).

 Contact-period studies in the Chesapeake in recent years have focused attention
 on Jamestown, at times overshadowing the archaeology and history of native
 communities beyond the fort (Hantman 2008). Studies that frame Jamestown as an
 icon of American history also constrain understanding of the site by obscuring
 European motivations and experiences while rendering the Native American
 presence all but invisible (Horning 2006a, p. 1). When native societies are included
 in these discussions, the terms are usually set by European voices. As Klein and
 Sanford (2004, p. 72) have observed, "The snapshot of Virginia Indians presented in

 the map and writings of John Smith have dominated anthropological reconstructions
 of the Native American world" in the Chesapeake. The memorialization of
 Jamestown has, in fact, obscured the histories of native groups beyond the Powhatan
 core and the cultural variability of Algonquian, Siouan, and Iroquoian societies
 implicated in early colonial history.

 Despite the challenges of seeing beyond Jamestown, recent scholarship on the
 contact period has included ethnohistorical reassessments that offer alternatives to a

 static ethnographic present and to narratives that cast American Indians primarily as

 victims. Archaeology centered on several prominent native settlements has likewise
 opened up a deep history of places and landscapes within the Powhatan core.
 Studies of other sites in the Chesapeake highlight the diversity of social strategies

 and the salience of deep-seated cultural structures throughout early colonial history.

 Descendant communities and indigenous archaeology

 In the past two decades, new forms of collaborative and consultative archaeology
 have emerged in the Chesapeake, partly in response to contemporary American
 Indians' insistence that they be included in discussions of their past. This recent and
 tentative development in the Chesapeake lags behind the changes in archaeological
 practice adopted in other North American regions that have responded to American
 Indians' demands and to federal legislation. Virginia has eleven state-recognized
 tribes (Moretti-Langholtz 1998; Rountree 1990), and these groups have become
 involved with several archaeological projects (e.g., Atkins 2009b; Gallivan and
 Moretti-Langholtz 2007; Hantman 2004). Maryland has at least 12 native
 descendant communities, none officially recognized as an indigenous tribe, and
 efforts to establish frameworks for consultation have had mixed results (Hughes and

 Henry 2006). The State of Delaware recognized the Nanticoke by statute during the
 19th century (Koenig and Stein 2007, p. 117), and the tribe has genealogical ties to
 the Lenape and the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape of Delaware and southern New Jersey
 (Blume 2006, p. 198). The Nanticoke and Lenape tribes have recently become
 involved in public archaeology and cultural resource management (Blume 2006;
 Petraglia et al. 2002), some of which included initially antagonistic relations
 between native leaders and archaeologists (e.g., Custer 2005).

 Complicating and constraining indigenous communities' efforts to gain access to

 and influence over archaeological research in the Chesapeake is the fact that none of
 these groups has federal recognition as Native American, a standing central to the
 consultation processes under the Native Americans Graves Protection and
 Repatriation Act and the National Historic Preservation Act as revised in 2001.
 Recent passage or revision of legislation in Virginia (Jameson 2003, pp. 32-33),
 Maryland (Hughes and Henry 2006, p. 113), and Delaware (Blume 2006, p. 200)
 has provided consultation structures outside the federal framework and more
 effective protections for native burials. Concerted efforts by native communities
 have resulted in repatriation and reburial of archaeologically excavated remains in
 Virginia (Rountree and Turner 2002, pp. 227-229), Maryland (Hughes and Henry
 2006, p. 113), and Delaware (Custer et al. 1990), beginning in the 1980s. During the

 past decade the remains of more than 100 individuals have been reburied in Virginia
 in cooperation with several state-recognized tribes (Moretti-Langholtz 1998). Each
 of these reburials involved significant cooperation between the Native American
 and archaeological communities in conjunction with the Virginia Department of
 Historic Resources.

 A small but active group of archaeologists and cultural anthropologists (e.g.,
 Cook 2000; Hantman 2004; Moretti-Langholtz 1998; Rountree 1990; Rountree
 and Turner 2002) has developed relationships with Virginia Indian communities
 that have "combined applied anthropology and advocacy to form creative models
 for collaborative research and ethnography" (Cook 2003, p. 191). A partnership
 between archaeologists at the University of Virginia and the Monacan community
 of central Virginia began two decades ago and represents an example of
 sustained collaboration in the region. Hantman has incorporated Monacan voices
 in his effort to write a seamless Monacan history linking "prehistory" to the
 recent Monacan past, starting these efforts by consulting with the Monacan Tribal
 Council and initiating research based in part on their priorities (Hantman et al.
 2000). In coastal Virginia, the Werowocomoco Research Group has more
 recently developed a framework for consultation and collaboration with six tribes
 descended from the Powhatans (Gallivan et al. 2005). The project was initiated
 by discussions with the Virginia Council on Indians and is informed by an all
 Native American advisory board. Several Virginia Indians have joined the project
 as field and laboratory technicians and have received training in fieldwork,
 laboratory analysis, and interpretation. These native archaeologists include a
 member of the Pamunkey tribe who has entered William and Mary's Ph.D.
 program and another who has since become a full-time field technician with a
 CRM company. Though limited in scope, this small opening of spaces in the
 archaeological community for members of the Virginia Indian community may
 result in archaeological practices that combine indigenous values with academic
 research and CRM priorities. Several of our native colleagues share a strong
 desire to see discussions of Werowocomoco's past extend beyond a focus on
 interactions with colonists at Jamestown, a priority we have incorporated into our
 research designs.

 Outside the academic setting that frames these efforts, consultation and
 collaboration with native communities has had mixed results in Virginia. The
 King William Reservoir project, the largest CRM effort in coastal Virginia, was
 structured by a memorandum of agreement that required consultation with three
 Native American tribes and direct participation by Virginia Indians (Gallivan and

 Moretti-Langholtz 2007). In practice, though, consultation and native participation
 were fraught with miscommunication, confusion, and frustration (Atkins 2009b).
 Even beyond its CRM aspects, this project was predicated on political marginal
 ization and exclusion of the public (Flannery 1999). In the face of determined
 opposition from environmentalists and Indian tribes as well as repeated difficulties
 in the permitting process, Newport News city officials decided to end their attempt
 to build the reservoir in 2009. In contrast, efforts to memorialize native history and

 indigenous places through the Virginia Historic Highway Markers program have
 resulted in more productive collaboration between Indians, archaeologists, and state

 government officials (Hantman 2008). Virginia Indians have seized the opportunity
 to appropriate these markers as monuments highlighting narratives involving native
 peoples and places that were previously ignored.

 Disagreements surrounding a CRM project in Delaware have led to collaborative

 efforts and a joint publication by an archaeologist and the assistant chief of the
 Nanticokes (Clark and Custer 2003). Clark and Custer's innovative reinterpretation
 of a burial pit encourages reconsideration of similar such features on other sites.
 Custer (2005) subsequently called for changes in archaeological practice that
 respond to descendant communities and to ethical imperatives regarding the Native
 American past. Central to his message are three priorities: fostering dialogue
 between archaeologists and Indians, allowing native priorities to shape research
 agendas, and incorporating a stronger preservation ethic to protect unthreatened
 sites. A flurry of responses to Custer's programmatic statement published in the
 same issue of North American Archaeologist documented a range of reactions by
 archaeologists (e.g., Espenshade 2005; Moeller 2005). Some questioned Custer's
 choice of (possibly rhetorical) language to characterize archaeologists' failures, and
 others noted his tendency to write of American Indians and of archaeologists in
 rather monolithic terms. More to the point, Shackel (2005) commends Custer for his
 willingness to critically assess his own work while noting that archaeological
 practice in other North American regions has already incorporated Custer's basic
 priorities and found that collaboration can be mutually beneficial for native
 communities and archaeologists. Indeed, the northern Chesapeake and Delaware
 Bay area have seen several collaborations recently, including those that have
 broadened discussions beyond a single native consultant and a single tribe (Blume
 2006). A particularly intriguing example that demonstrates one possible direction
 such efforts may take has resulted in archaeologists' incorporation of traditional
 knowledge to broaden their conceptions of the archaeological record (Petraglia and
 Cunningham 2006).

 Perhaps the most dramatic change in Chesapeake archaeological practice over

 the past two decades has resulted from the efforts to communicate, consult, and

 collaborate with descendant communities, native and otherwise. During this period
 archaeologists studying the native past dropped most claims that we operate in an
 objective, scientific void and developed new relationships with native communities

 and a greater awareness of archaeology's contemporary implications. The mixed
 results of consultative and collaborative archaeology in the Chesapeake, though,
 continue to raise vexing questions with broad relevance beyond the region. Can
 archaeologists retain the independence necessary to pursue a range of questions
 about the native past even as we begin to share authority over the research and
 interpretation process with contemporary native communities? How can archaeol

 ogy proceed in a collaborative way when the circumstances (particularly in some
 CRM settings) present few if any priorities shared by archaeologists and descendant
 communities? Perhaps because of the absence of federally recognized tribes in the
 area, collaborative archaeology in the Chesapeake has followed various pathways,

 allowing archaeologists and descendant communities to tailor their relationships to a
 project's circumstances. The qualified successes that have emerged often share
 several elements that have allayed the suspicions and fears of various stakeholders.

 These include relationships between archaeologists and native leaders that
 developed over years, early notification and sustained communication that provide
 native communities the opportunity to influence the structure of planned investi
 gations, transparency regarding the financial structure of archaeological research,
 and flexibility regarding project outcomes that may include site visitation, publicly
 accessible publications, or exhibits that are attentive to a descendant community's
 priorities.

 Conclusion

 In 1995, Dent (p. 68) spotlighted a handful of studies that began "to fill an existing
 vacuum where processual explanations have clearly been questioned." Here I have
 expanded this roster with a list of publications that offer a glimpse of what could
 become a new era of Chesapeake research. A growing number of studies of the
 Woodland and contact periods have uncovered particular native histories of social
 interaction, population movements and persistent places, meanings embedded in
 materials and practices, and colonial strategies masking native actors and
 indigenous landscapes. Interpretive frames have widened considerably beyond
 approaches emphasizing cultural ecology, systems theory, and cultural materialism.
 Where environmental histories are incorporated into recent Chesapeake studies,
 researchers have recognized the importance of precise temporal sequences, diverse
 local conditions, and the intertwined histories of natural and social landscapes.

 Although the few academic researchers who study the Native American
 archaeology of the Chesapeake have made important contributions to recent
 developments, much of the recent innovative interpretation and collaboration has
 occurred outside the academy in cultural resource management. This is encouraging
 given that the vast majority of archaeology in the Chesapeake is and will be
 conducted in this setting. It also is of some concern given that the results of much of

 this work can be difficult to access. Efforts by historic preservation officials to make
 CRM's "gray literature" more readily available are limited in the Chesapeake,
 though Delaware's Department of Transportation, Maryland's Historic Trust, and
 the District of Columbia's Historic Preservation Office have led the way in
 responsibly beginning this process on the web. The Virginia Department of Historic
 Resources' various report series also offer a particularly valuable contribution to the
 regional literature. Supported by several state agencies and nonprofit historic
 preservation institutions, the Comparative Archaeological Study of Colonial
 Chesapeake Culture represents an impressive model of digital archaeology centered
 on 17th-century colonialism (King et al. 2006). Hopefully, efforts such as this one
 are just the beginning of a trend toward creative data sharing that fosters diverse
 interpretation through digital technologies.

 While it is difficult to predict the future course of native archaeology of the
 Chesapeake, there are indications of at least some of the questions that will play a
 role. Early and Middle Woodland research has demonstrated that substantial
 changes in hunter-forager settlement and subsistence occurred amid new patterns of

 regional interaction and qualitatively different forms of residential stability. Is it

 possible to trace the long-term histories of Algonquian societies that apparently
 came to settle in the estuarine Chesapeake during this era? Understanding the
 diverse social traditions of these periods will require intensive investigations of
 aggregation locations and nodes within long-distance exchange networks.

 Late Woodland archaeology in the Chesapeake has long benefitted from direct
 historical approaches linking documented societies to archaeological complexes.
 Might we benefit from jettisoning generic chiefdom models in the effort to trace the
 development of complex societies of the Chesapeake and to understand their
 histories on their own terms? Moving beyond the limitations of neo-evolutionary
 typologies and toward historically oriented approaches will require more precise
 chronological methods as well as detailed studies of local cultural sequences and
 environmental dynamics spanning the Late Woodland through the contact period.
 Contact-period archaeology has demonstrated that native strategies in the face of
 the colonial encounter were closely connected to the cultural structures of the
 precontact world and were more varied than European documentary sources allow.
 How did the new forms of social interaction that emerged during this period reflect
 both colonial agendas and native social strategies? Answers to this question will
 require more effort to bridge the historical and precontact archaeology of the
 Chesapeake as well as a more intensive focus on native archaeology that postdates

 early contact.

 Descendant communities have come to play a more prominent role in
 Chesapeake archaeology, presenting new challenges and opportunities for archae
 ologists working in the region. Can archaeologists and native communities develop
 means of sharing power over research agendas and archaeological practices that
 produce positive results? The expanded involvement of descendant communities in
 Chesapeake archaeology will, I suggest, reconnect the Native American past,
 present, and future in ways that begin to challenge accepted narratives of American
 history (Gallivan et al. in press).
