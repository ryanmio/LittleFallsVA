 THE HISTOEIC POTOMAC EIVER.

 By WILLIAM EDGAR ROGERS.

 (Read before the Society, February 20, 1912.)

 "All quiet along the Potomac tonight,

 Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;

 Their tents in the rays of the clear Autumn moon,

 Or the light of the watch fires are gleaming,

 A tremulous sigh, as the gentle night wind,

 Through the forest leaves softly is creeping;
 While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,

 Keep guard - for the army is sleeping. "

 Half a century has slipped by since these lines of

 Miss Ethel Beers first touched a nation's heart at a

 time when the fierce passions of men and the deadly
 conflict gave little room for sentiment. Appealing to
 many a stricken home, North and South (for grief has
 no sectional lines), was the story of the "Lone Picket"
 and how,

 "All quiet along the Potomac tonight;

 No sound save the rush of the river;

 While soft falls the dew on the face of the dead -

 The picket's off duty forever."

 Fifty years agone! The Potomac still flows on its
 quiet, majestic course to the sea. The watch fires no
 longer gleam, but the soldiers are peacefully dreaming
 on the slopes of Arlington, their generals among them,
 though the white tents have given place to the more un-
 pretentious one of green, " whose curtains never out-
 ward swing,"

 li Under the sod and the dew,

 Awaiting the judgment day,

 Under the laurels the blue,

 Under the laurels the gray,"

 and mocking the fading race of men the peaceful
 Potomac flows ever on and on, a silent witness of the
 procession of the ages. What a procession - past,
 present and future !

 The tombs, monasteries and ruins of excavated cities
 in Egypt, Asia Minor and Babylonia are being ran-
 sacked by archaeologists for the priceless parchments
 from which they may wrest the secrets of the past.
 They tell us these palimpsests, as they are called, are
 overlaid with different writings two and three deep, the
 first imperfectly washed out to give place to a second
 and sometimes a third, written at intervals of a century
 or more, all of which science is now able to restore
 and interpret.

 So, hidden away in the archives of Tidewater Vir-
 ginia, and in the musty records and letters of many an
 ancestral home, there may yet be found the priceless
 material from which will be woven the true story of the
 "Cradle of the Bepublic," and the people who for the
 last three centuries have lived, loved and died on the
 banks of its peaceful rivers, each generation writing a
 new record, a glorious one of the past.

 What priceless palimpsests to students of American
 history would be those giving in detail the correct story
 of the Potomac and the James, and the lives of the
 people who lived on their shores.

 It is not the purpose in this paper to attempt any
 such detailed history, but simply to call attention to the
 neglected beauties of the Potomac and its wealth of
 historic material, in the hope that in coming years
 other and abler pens will take up the story and do it
 justice.

 The lovers of American literature find embalmed in

 its shrines the most delightful play of fancy and the
 gentlest artistic touch in association with our rivers.
 Nothing appeals so strongly to poet or artist as the
 quiet majestic flow of the silent river. The Concord,
 the Merrimac, the Penobscot and the Charles, how
 closely they are entwined with the memories and the
 writings of those bright stars in our literary firmament,
 Holmes and Hawthorne, Longfellow, Thoreau, Emer-
 son and others. These rivers occupy a very inconspic-
 uous place and play a very inconspicuous part in the
 commercial economy of the nation, and the great world
 would seldom hear them mentioned but that forever

 their places are fixed in literature by those gifted men,
 who walk with us no more, but whose works live after
 them.

 The Connecticut has a literature of its own and the

 romantic Hudson, with its rugged Catskills and majes-
 tic highlands, its West Point and Sleepy Hollow - all
 the grandeur of the scenery of the Hudson as well as
 the more subdued and quiet beauty to be found among
 its diversified attractions, one will find somewhere
 pictured with daintiest touch of pen in the works of
 Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, N. P.
 Willis, Eodman Drake, or Gaylord Clark.

 Artists, poets and historians have freely given of

 their best in portraying the charms of these streams,
 which they have immortalized, and each has a saga and
 a literature of its own.

 How is it, then, that our lovely Potomac, combining

 all the varied attractions of the rivers mentioned,
 richer than all of them in historic lore, from the time
 of John Smith to the present, and bearing on its fair
 shores the sparkling jewel of the capital of one of the
 greatest nations on earth - how is it that the Potomac
 finds no prominent place in American literature?

 Here on its banks were born and here were passed
 the boyhood days and years of illustrious manhood,
 and here sleeping the dreamless sleep by its side are
 the two friends in life and neighbors in death, the
 Father of his Country and George Mason, of Gunston
 Hall, author of the famous Virginia Bill of Eights,
 which antedated the Declaration of Independence.

 Brilliant writers, John P. Kennedy in the '40 's, John
 Esten Cooke in later years, and a few others have now
 and then thrown a flashlight over isolated scenes or
 times on the Potomac, but its history is yet to be
 written and its charms still remain unsung.

 From the earliest rise of its branches in cool, trick-
 ling streamlets in the mountains of West Virginia, till
 its silvery flow is lost in the bosom of the Chesapeake,
 every mile of its onward flow is in some way associated
 with the nation's history.

 Before the earliest dawn of that history, centuries
 before the plash of John Smith's sturdy oarsmen broke
 the solemn stillness of the forest primeval about the
 Lower Falls of the Potomac in 1608, or its lower
 reaches were bejewelled by the lordly homes and
 princely estates of the cavaliers of Virginia, the banks
 and beautiful valleys were thickly peopled by a race of
 whom we know nothing - a race who lived their little
 day and passed on leaving no records, no trace, save
 scattered mounds, outlines of fortifications and ditches,
 fragments of strange domestic utensils, and here and
 there uncovered in the march of improvement gigantic
 skeletons of a prehistoric race. These men, their joys,
 their sorrows, their bones are all buried together and
 oblivion has drawn about them her kindly mantle.

 Next in the panorama of the centuries and touching
 the borderland of our recorded history, comes trooping
 along that grave but unfortunate people whose light

 canoes have long since "vanished from off the crested
 wave," the red men of the forest, whose rival nations
 struggled long and fiercely for supremacy in the rich
 valleys of the north and south branches of the Potomac
 and about its headwaters.

 Long before Braddock's defeat and the French and
 Indian war, and more than a century before the vet-
 erans of McClellan and Lee, the men of the North and
 of the South met in deadly combat on the banks of the
 Antietam and the Potomac, the event was fore-
 shadowed by another bloody struggle almost on the
 same spot, between the men of the north and those of
 the south. The powerful Delaware tribe from New
 York, Pennsylvania and Ohio here contended with the
 equally powerful and warlike Catawbas from the
 Carolinas.

 One battle took place at the mouth of Antietam
 Creek, on the banks of the Potomac, then known, for
 that part of the stream above Harpers Ferry, by its
 Indian name, the Cohongoruton. How fierce and san-
 guinary was the fray may be gathered from the fact
 stated by the historian, Mr. Samuel Kercheval, in his
 "History of the Valley," that not one Delaware
 escaped.

 This region seems to have been a favorite field for
 the contending Indian tribes or nations, rivaling that
 of the famous ' ' dark and bloody ground ' ' of Kentucky ;
 for the same author tells in his book of other battles

 between those rival nations, one on the Potomac at the
 mouth of Conococheague Creek - once seriously con-
 sidered as the location for the capital of this republic -
 where only one Delaware escaped. Another bloody
 battle was fought about a mile and a half from the
 Potomac, at Slim Bottom, on the Wappatomaka (the
 Indian name for the great south branch of the Potomac

 Eiver near Painted Eock). And still another great
 battle between these warring tribes occurred at Hang-
 ing Eock, on the south branch, in the county of Hamp-
 shire. On these old battlefields, the historian tells us,
 long rows of Indian graves bore mute testimony to the
 sanguinary strife and the valor of the unfortunate
 Delawares, who were nearly annihilated.

 To the student of history it must ever be interesting
 to observe how geographical - or perhaps topograph-
 ical were better - conditions for successive ages con-
 trol the march of armies, directing them again and
 again to the same old battlefields, till it would seem
 that certain localities on the surface of old Mother

 Earth were so richly fertilized with human blood that
 never would they lack luxuriant verdure.

 The narrow gateway in Asia Minor between the
 mountains and the sea, through which for centuries
 ebbed and flowed alternately the warring hosts of
 Europe and Asia - the myriads of Xerxes, Darius,
 Cambyses and Alexander the Great - and along which
 thundered again and again the victorious legions of
 Imperial Eome, is a case in point.

 The Italian foothills and passes of the Alps, and
 those of the Pyrenees in southern France, further
 illustrate it.

 Here in our own country the fords and shallows of
 the Upper Potomac afford easy access from North to
 South of warring hosts, and those bloody Indian
 battles fought in that locality - what were they but
 dark forerunners of the far bloodier struggles that
 grim destiny had marked out for the mighty armies of
 the North and the South, when, centuries later, they
 should on the same ground close in deadly strife.

 During the Civil War all the region of the Upper
 Potomac was the scene of constant repetition of march-

 ing and remarching, crossing and recrossing, midnight
 raid and foray, picket firing and skirmish line, by and
 between the men of Lee and Jackson, McClellan and
 Meade, Early and Sheridan, the prelude and aftermath
 of the tragedies of Antietam, Gettysburg, Harper's
 Ferry, Ball's Bluff, Falling Waters and Winchester.
 From 1861 to 1864 the lurid flame of war blazed all

 along these mountain tops ; every great rock along this
 river's now peaceful flow was a bloody milestone in the
 march of war - every acre marks a hero 's grave.

 The magnificent scenery of the much-traveled Hud-
 son is familiar to the public but comparatively few
 know that it can be duplicated and even excelled in
 every feature by the Potomac somewhere on its wind-
 ing way. For grandeur the famous Highlands of the
 Hudson cannot compare with the awe-inspiring gorges
 of Harper's Ferry, where the noisy Shenandoah bursts
 through its mountain barriers to mingle its foaming
 waters with those of the Potomac. Thomas Jefferson's

 matchless description of this wonderful work of the
 Creator has made it familiar to every school boy.

 Far up in the upper reaches of both the North and

 South branches of the Potomac are to be found freaks

 of nature of the rarest kind, and scenery unsurpassed
 for grandeur and wildness anywhere within the na-
 tional domains, barring the canyons of the Yellowstone
 and Colorado, the Yellowstone Park and Alaska.

 And here just at our own doors, at Great Falls, we
 have one of the wonders of nature, which for beauty
 and majesty defies description.

 An artist who had travelled much and repeatedly
 visited all of the beauty spots of France, Switzerland,
 Italy and the Nile, recently said to the writer: "If our
 Great Falls had been located in Switzerland, the tour-
 ists of the world would flock to its banks."

 Where in all of this wide world could there be a more

 impressive sight than that from the Aqueduct Bridge
 when in summer :

 'Comes still evening on twilight gray
 And has in sober livery all things clad. '

 The sunset after-glow over the Virginia hills paints
 the rich sky with such dainty, varied, beautiful tints as
 no artist could ever hope to equal. The dark shadows
 of the deep woods on the Virginia Heights opposite the
 Three Sisters quiver in darkly lengthening lines on the
 placid bosom of the swiftly flowing river and scores of
 graceful Indian canoes with young men and maidens
 paddle lightly over the mirrored surface. The grand-
 est shaft on earth, that to the Father of his country,
 the silent sentinel of the ages to come, thrills one by its
 solemn majesty, as the evening shadows enfold its
 lofty summit melting away into cloudland.

 Analostan Island and its dark woods sleeps by the

 side of the still waters and dreams of the old colonial

 times when a stately mansion graced its fair acres and
 the free-handed hospitality of Col. John Mason, son of
 the statesman and patriot, reigned supreme.

 And over there on the other hand we see the sacred

 heights of Arlington. In that grand old mansion Gen-
 eral Lee wooed and won his young and beautiful bride,
 the mistress of all those broad acres where now are
 encamped in mute and quiet peace a mighty army of
 heroes, the Silent Congress of the Dead.

 Ah! here is abundant theme for the artist, the poet,
 the historian ; and our river has seen and knows it all,
 but flows ever silently, resistlessly on.

 But I must not linger here. In the necessarily brief

 time allotted for this communication, we shall be able
 to glance only cursorily at some of the leading features

 of the earliest recorded history of the Potomac. All
 the wealth of material clustering around its subsequent
 history - the trying days of the Eevolution; of the war
 of 1812, and of our terrible Civil War; the fragrant
 aroma of legend, romance and song, still clinging
 around its ancient, ancestral halls, all these may as I
 have said some day be illumined by the pen of some
 other and more competent lover of our beautiful river.
 One cannot but feel a deeper interest in the region
 about the south branch of the Potomac and the valley
 of Virginia when he recalls the fact that it is insepar-
 ably connected with the career of General Washington,
 for it was there he received the schooling of hardship,
 self-denial and experience that moulded his character
 and fitted him for his subsequent illustrious career.

 To the youth of our land his early life must ever be
 an impressive lesson and lasting inspiration to them to
 join the ranks of those who furnished the majority of
 our country's great characters - the ranks of self-made
 men.

 Deprived of the advantages of education as it is now
 known and imparted, we find him at the age of sixteen
 a master of the science of surveying, and starting out
 to earn his own living as a surveyor in the employ of
 the powerful Lord Fairfax, whose land grants covered
 much of the valley of Virginia, then - in 1748 - an al-
 most untrodden wilderness, with but few struggling
 settlers.

 Senator Lodge in his fascinating life of Washington

 speaks of these three years of his life as a

 1 ' rough life but a manly and robust one, and the men who
 live through it, although often rude and coarse, are never
 weak or effeminate. To Washington it was an admirable
 school. It strengthened his muscles and hardened him to
 exposure and fatigue. It accustomed him to risks and perils

 of various kinds and made him fertile in expedients and
 confident of himself, while the nature of his work rendered
 him careful and industrious."

 A faint, prophetic suggestion of the miseries of
 Valley Forge is to be found in this extract from one
 of Washington's letters written during this rough
 experience :

 " Since you received my letter of October last, I have not
 slept above three or four nights in a bed, but after walking
 a good deal all the day, I have laid down before the fire upon
 a little hay, straw or fodder, or a bearskin, whichever was to
 be had, with man, wife and children, like dogs and cats, and
 happy is he who gets the berth nearest the fire. Nothing
 would make it pass off tolerably but a good reward. A
 doubloon is my constant gain every day that the weather will
 permit of my going out, and sometimes six pistoles."

 The historian already quoted tells us of Washing-

 ton's experience at this time:

 "All these things, as well as the progress of their work and
 their various resting places, Washington noted down briefly
 but methodically in a diary, showing in these rough notes the
 first evidences of that keen observation of nature and men

 and daily incidents which he developed to such good purpose
 in after life."

 It would be interesting to know whether at this early
 age this keen observation had caused to germinate in
 his fertile mind the idea, which afterwards, next to
 the salvation and welfare of his beloved country, be-
 came the dream of his life, of seeing the Potomac be-
 come "a channel of commerce between Great Britain

 and the immense Western territory, a tract of country
 unfolding to our view."

 It was Washington's hope to connect the head-
 waters of the Potomac with the headwaters of some

 stream emptying into the Ohio by some short portage,

 and thus, by having the shorter route tp tidewater,
 secure the immense trade of the Northwest which

 afterwards fell to New York and the Erie Canal.

 His own state of Virginia did not enthuse over this
 magnificent project for her commercial supremacy,
 and in 1784 he wrote to Jefferson :

 "Despairing of any aid from the public I became the prin-
 cipal mover of a bill to empower a number of subscribers to
 undertake at their own expense on conditions which were
 expressed the extension of the navigation of (the Potomac)
 from tidewater to Wills Creek (Cumberland), about 150
 miles."

 From his efforts resulted the organization of the
 Potomac Company in 1784 and the opening of naviga-
 tion from Cumberland to tidewater in 1802. The

 boats were propelled by poling up stream, and floated
 with the tide downward. The fall of 70 feet at Great
 Falls was overcome by five sets of locks in massive
 masonry, the solid walls of which remain to-day silent
 witnesses to the foresight and enterprise of that
 wonderful man. The franchise of the Potomac Com-

 pany was transferred to the Chesapeake & Ohio canal
 in 1828, and the Potomac Company and the project for
 its short connecting waterway with the Northwest, so
 dear to the heart of Washington, passed from the
 minds of men, their only monument the imposing ruins
 of the locks at Great Falls.

 The history of the Potomac Company, and of Wash-
 ington's repeated patient and minute explorations of
 the mountain streams and tributaries of the Ohio,
 Monongahela, Kanawha, Alleghany and Potomac rivers
 in search of the shortest and most available connecting
 link between the waterways of the Ohio, the Great

 Lakes, and the Potomac, would make an interesting
 volume yet to be written.1

 A part of this project was the establishment of a
 manufacturing city at the locks of Great Falls. The
 city was laid out, lots sold and some structures erected
 at Matildaville, the strangely named embryo city. All
 that remains to-day to mark the spot are the ruins of
 the old warehouse and historic "Dickey's." But a
 short distance below these are the locks. Adjoining
 these locks below is the deep cut blasted through the
 solid rock to a depth of sixty feet or more which gives
 outlet to the Potomac below the Falls. Dense thickets
 and great overarching trees conspire to hide from a
 too curious public these imposing monuments of the
 failure of Washington's cherished dream.

 The question of these locks seems to have cost him
 many anxious hours. It is repeatedly adverted to in
 his correspondence with Tobias Lear, his secretary,
 who at times was actively connected with the manage-
 ment of the enterprise, and December 21, 1794, he
 writes him:

 "The plan of Mr. Claiborne's engineer as far as I under-
 stand it is to avoid locks altogether. The vessels are received
 into a basket or cradle, and let down by means of a 'laver'
 and pullies; and raised again by weights at the hinder
 extremity of the laver, which works on an axis at the head
 of a substantial post fixed about the center of the laver. On
 this principle but differently constructed, Mr. Greenleaf, a
 few months ago, showed me a model, the efficacy of which he
 seemed to entertain the most exalted opinion. My doubts
 of the utility of both, arise from the insufficiency of any
 machinery of this sort to bear the weight of the cradle when

 1When the above was written, I had not seen the exhaustive papers
 written by Mrs. Corra Bacon-Foster, which were read before the Society
 and published in its vol. 15, Kecords 1912. They cover the whole ground
 and form an invaluable contribution to American history.

 charged with water and a loaded boat therein, and its aptness
 to get out of order by means thereof. Mr. Weston has told
 me (but of this I am not certain) that no method of raising
 and lowering boats has been found equal to locks. Still, as
 I observed in my last, I should be for hearing the opinions
 and explanations of any and every scientific and practical
 character that could be easily got at on the subject."

 Strange things destiny brings about ! Strange that
 the footprints of the two forceful men whose names are
 most closely associated with the early history of the
 Potomac should meet on this very spot, though an
 interval of two centuries lies between.

 It has been said that Smith never reached the Great

 Falls, that it was impossible for him to have passed
 above Little Falls with his boat, but it must be remem-
 bered that in his zeal of exploration he often left his
 boat and made little excursions inland. He describes

 one such at Quiyough (Occoquan) where after rowing
 as far as they could, they marched inland some seven
 or eight miles.

 What more probable than that they left their boat
 at Little Falls and pushed on up the river? This de-
 scription surely fits Great Falls and not the lesser.

 "Having gone as high as we could with the bote we met
 divers salvages in canoues well loaded with the flesh of beares,
 deare and other beastes whereof we had part.

 ' ' Here we found mighty rocks growing in some places above
 the ground as high as the shrubby trees and divers other solid
 quarries and divers tinctures; and divers places where the
 waters had f alne from the mountains they had left a tinctured
 spangled skerf e that made many bare places seem as guilded.
 Digging the grawnde above in the highest cliff of rocks we saw
 it was a clare sand so mingled with yellow spangles as if it had
 been half pin dust. ' '

 life reads like a chapter from 'The Cloister and the

 Hearth. ' It abounds in such things as we call improb-
 able in novels. ' J

 It was he who first explored the Potomac and pub-
 lished its beauties to the world. Nothing occurred in
 his adventurous career more wild and improbable than
 that on the wooded point which he rounded from the
 Eastern Branch there should rise within three cen-

 turies the fairest city on earth, the City Beautiful, the
 stately capital of one of the greatest of world powers.
 What more improbable than at Great Falls, which in-
 terposed an insuperable barrier to his further ex-
 plorations, there should stand two centuries later a
 man of his own rugged, indomitable type, whose name
 and fame echoed around the world, and whose last
 fading years of life were largely devoted to removing
 those very barriers so fatal to the further progress of
 the ambitious explorer.

 A wonderful man this same John Smith. Without

 him the Jamestown colonists would have been an-
 nihilated and the Jamestown Exposition never heard
 of. Fiske says of him :

 "To this day John Smith is one of the personages about

 whom writers of history are apt to lose their tempers. In
 recent days there have been many attempts to belittle him,
 but the turmoil that has been made is itself a tribute to the

 potency and incisiveness of his character. Weak men do not
 call forth such belligerency. Amid all the conflicting state-

 ments, too, there comes out quite distinctly a contemporary
 recognition of his dignity and purity. Never was a warrior
 known, says one old writer, 'from debts, wine, dice and oaths
 so free,' a staunch Puritan in morals though not in doctrine."

 It was a turbulent, quarrelsome company that
 largely predominated in the first Jamestown colony,
 and not such stuff as nation-builders are made from.

 ' ' Lust for gold and not love of liberty was the inspiration

 of the movement. ' '

 Very different in character and quality were the
 early settlers on the Potomac. When the last battle of
 the civil war in England was fought, in September,
 1651, and King Charles I was afterwards executed,
 there was no place in England for his cavalier sup-
 porters. A stream of emigration set in at once, and
 it was largely directed toward Virginia. Ship after
 ship followed, carrying with their rude accommoda-
 tions, compared with modern luxury, some of the best
 blood of England. One ship alone we read carried
 three hundred and fifty of these English squires and
 gentlemen, as in those days they were designated. It
 was these men and the descendants of these men, a few
 of whose baronial estates still lie scattered along the
 banks of the Potomac and the James, who shaped the
 destinies of Virginia and very largely those of the
 nation.

 While they lived in comparative peace and luxury
 in their stately homes on the tidewaters of Virginia,
 a struggle for existence, before the Eevolution, was
 going on around the upper reaches of the Potomac.
 In the valley and along the north and the south
 branches there was another class of settlers, sturdy
 pioneers - many of them Dutch or of Dutch extraction
 - who, pushing forward from the frontier land of
 Pennsylvania, braved all the horrors of Indian war-
 fare, scalping knife and burning stake. The early his-
 tory of the Upper Potomac is blotted with tears over
 the sad fate of many of those pioneers of civilization
 in the Valley of Virginia. More than one book would
 be required to give the details of the bloody story.
 Strange, is it not, that to-day, while conventions are
 being held in which governors of States, railroad pres-

 idents and captains of industry from all parts of the
 land assemble and plan for the improvement of in-
 land waterways - strange, is it not, that on this subject
 as on so many others affecting the growth and pros-
 perity of the republic, George Washington, whose name
 is so inseparably connected with the early history of
 the Potomac, should be now, as he was then, the pio-
 neer ; the first to blaze the way.

 ' ' First in peace, first in war, and first in the hearts
 of his countrymen," he was also the first advocate of
 inland waterways. His name and work is so closely
 intertwined with the history of the Potomac Eiver that
 no adequate sketch of one can be made without fre-
 quent allusion to the other.

 In 1748, as we have said, he as a boy was survey-
 ing on the Upper Potomac and in the Valley of Vir-
 ginia, for Lord Fairfax, and is incorrectly said to have
 located and placed the celebrated Fairfax Stone, now
 an important piece of evidence in contention in courts
 in a question of boundary lines between two states of
 the Union.

 In 1753, we find him the bearer of dispatches from
 the Governor of Virginia to the commander of the
 French forces in and about Lake Erie. In 1754, he
 commanded the Virginia regiment which inaugurated
 the French and Indian War, at Great Meadows and
 Fort Necessity, at what is now called Farmington, in
 Pennsylvania.

 In 1755, he marched over the same route with the ill-
 fated Braddock, crossing the Potomac at Wills Creek,
 as he did again in 1758, when he led the advance with
 the Virginians, under the command of Gen. John
 Forbes' army, which captured Fort Duquesne. Again
 in 1784, we find him travelling the same old trails -
 thirty years after his misfortune at Fort Necessity,

 twenty-nine years after Braddock's defeat and death.
 This time his mission was one of peace. He was no
 longer an inconspicuous Virginia Colonel, but a suc-
 cessful general, and head of a young but mighty na-
 tion. He adhered to his lifelong habit of keeping a
 diary.

 On the 6th of September he records,

 "Remained at Bath [Berkely] all day and was showed the
 model of a boat constructed by the ingenious Mr. Eumsey
 for ascending the rapid currents by mechanism; the prin-
 ciples of which were not only shown and fully explained to
 me, but to my very great satisfaction exhibited in private
 under the injunction of secrecy until he saw the effect of an
 application he was about to make to the Assembly of this
 state for a reward.

 "The model and its operations upon the water which had
 been made to run pretty swift, not only convinced me of
 what before I thought next to, if not quite impracticable, but
 that it might be to the greatest possible utility in inland navi-
 gation ; and in rapid currents ; that are shallow. ' '

 Here we have the first approach to what Mr. Eum-
 sey afterwards demonstrated on Sir John's Bun, a
 steam-propelled vessel, an invention for which John
 Fitch and Bobert Fulton claimed priority.

 Oil every page of Washington's diary for this month
 of September one reads of his anxious, persistent ef-
 fort to find the "Nearest and best communication be-
 tween the Eastern and Western Waters." His efforts
 were not confined to the Potomac alone, nor the James
 - long before this trip, and while he was still in com-
 mand of the Continental Army with headquarters at
 Newburgh, N. Y., in 1783, he made a tour up the Mo-
 hawk Valley in New York state, with a view to ex-
 amine the feasibility of a waterway connection be-
 tween the Great Lakes and the Hudson.

 On his return he wrote to Chevalier de Chastellux:

 "I could not help taking a more extensive view of the vast

 inland navigation of these United States, and could not but
 be struck by the immense extent and importance of it, and
 of the goodness of that Providence which has dealt its favors
 to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God we may have
 wisdom enough to improve them. I shall not rest contented
 till I have explored the "Western Country and traversed these
 lines, or a great part of them which have given bounds to a
 new empire."

 Immediately on his return to Mount Vernon Wash-

 ington summed up the result of his observations, giv-
 ing in detail some ten or twelve different water routes
 combined with portages from Detroit to tidewater, and
 adds :

 "When the subject is considered in a political point of
 view it appears of much greater importance. No well-
 informed mind need be told that the flanks and rear of the

 United Territory are possessed by other powers, and for-
 midable ones, too - nor how necessary it is to apply the cement
 of interest to bind all parts of it together, by one indissoluble
 band - particularly the middle states with the country imme-
 diately back of them, for what ties let me ask should we have
 on these people if the Spaniards on their right or Great
 Britain on their left should invite their trade and seek

 alliances with them?"

 These far-seeing views of Washington a century
 and a half later were found to meet a great national
 impulse of a mighty nation - an impulse forcibly ex-
 pressed by Secretary of State Eoot in a late address
 to the Inland Waterways Convention in Washington:

 "There is no greater achievement than the transportation
 of articles which are valueless at one point to another point
 where they are valuable. The railroads of the country no
 longer are able physically to carry the traffic of America, and

 the one avenue open to such traffic is water transportation.
 We must move forward or we will go backward. I see
 American production handicapped by two things: First, the
 great cost of getting the goods to the seaboard, and second,
 the absence of an American merchant marine. ' '

 It is a fascinating story that runs like a scarlet
 thread through many an old musty volume, yellowed
 and tattered parchment - that story a century and a
 half old - of the struggle between two mighty nations
 along the great lakes and the wild mountain passes of
 the Alleghanies for the control and supremacy of the
 vast and unknown empire lying beyond their shaggy
 summits.

 Truly does Hurlburt, the eloquent historian, write:

 "The Appalachian Mountain system proved a tremendous

 handicap to Saxon progress. True there were waterways
 inland - the Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, James and
 Potomac Eivers - but these led straight into the mountains
 where for generations the feeble settlements could not spread,
 and where explorers became disheartened ere the rich empire
 beyond was reached. The St. Lawrence, on the other hand,
 offered a rough but sure course, tempting ambitious men
 onward to the great lake system from which it flowed, and
 the Ottawa Eiver offered yet another course to the same
 splendid goal. So while the sturdy English were planting
 sure feet along the seaboard, new France was spreading by
 leaps and bounds across the longitudes. ' '

 The troubles of the sturdy settlers in western Vir-
 ginia and along the banks of the upper Potomac and
 the Ohio did not end with the French and Indian War
 nor the War of the Eevolution. From 1754 till * ' Mad
 Anthony Wayne's" crushing defeat of the blood-
 thirsty savages in 1794 these hardy pioneers on the
 borderland of civilization lived in a constant state of
 daily and nightly peril. The banks of the Potomac,

 the Shenandoah and the Ohio were dotted with forts.
 Not the forts of our day, for in some places a single
 blockhouse with a cabin or two constituted a fort. In
 others, more pretentious, a range of log cabins loop-
 holed for rifles formed one side, and divisions or
 partitions for families separated the cabins from each
 other ; very different were they from the stately homes
 on the lower Potomac. The walls on the outside were
 ten or twelve feet high, the slope of the roof being
 turned wholly inward. The blockhouses were built at
 the angles of the fort, projecting about two feet be-
 yond the outer walls of the cabins and stockades.

 The families belonging to these forts were so much
 attached to their nearby cabins on their farms that
 they seldom moved into the forts in the spring until
 some horrid murder announced the presence of In-
 dians in the vicinity.

 General Washington on his tour in 1784 had in-
 tended prolonging his itinerary to his lands at the
 mouth of the Great Kanawha and on the Ohio, but the
 activities of the Indians at that time caused him to
 change his programme and return. Mention was made
 of his meeting at Bath while on this trip the ingenious
 Mr. Eumsey.

 Two years afterward (1786) Eumsey made a suc-

 cessful demonstration of his boat - the first ever made
 of a passenger boat propelled entirely by steam - on
 the Potomac just above Shepardstown. He succeeded
 in attaining a speed of four to five miles an hour
 against the swift river currents.

 Howe, the Virginia historian, who wrote in 1845,

 says :

 " There are now living several persons who were on board
 at the time, among them Mrs. Ann Baker; Washington is
 also said to have been among the passengers."

 Three years after this John Fitch, who disputed
 priority of invention with Eumsey, made his first suc-
 cessful trip on the Delaware Eiver near Philadelphia.
 In 1797 John Stevens, of Hoboken, and Chancellor
 Livingston, of New York, were experimenting with
 steamboats on the Hudson, afterwards aided by Nich-
 olas Roosevelt (of the family from which the Presi-
 dent sprang), but though partially successful, it was
 not till 1807 they succeeded in building a boat which
 attained the required speed, and then Robert Fulton,
 with his Clermont, had beaten them by only a few days.
 So the claim for our historic Potomac of bearing on
 its bright waters the first successful steamboat is an
 established fact.

 Poor " Crazy Rumsey," as his neighbors called him,

 shared the fate of all inventors.

 Washington, ever quick to recognize meritorious
 claims of inventors, when the Potomac company was
 organized, in 1785, called him to the task of "render-
 ing navigation possible around Great Falls, Seneca
 Falls and Shenandoah Falls, at Harpers Ferry."

 Nothing, however, could long divert his mind from
 the cherished steamboat scheme. For many years on
 the banks of the Potomac, not far from his modest
 home, was pointed out "Rumsey's Walk," the place
 where the dreamer, in deep meditation, paced for
 weary hours at a time. The voices unheard by others
 lured him on. To England he went, scanty in purse,
 but rich in hope. There privations beset him, and the
 debtors ' prison frowned threateningly across his way ;
 but in his lexicon there was no such word as "fail."
 He secured his British patents in 1788. The tide
 turned; money came his way; his life's plans were on
 the eve of realization ; his boat was built ; all was
 ready; success was certain, and wealth and fame were

 to follow. A lecture before an overflowing audience
 of the wealth, learning and beauty of Liverpool was
 too heavy a task for poor overtaxed Eumsey. In the
 midst of it he was stricken down by apoplexy, and the
 shores of his loved Potomac saw him no more.

 The close of the career of his famous rival, John

 Fitch, was equally pathetic. He died at Bardstown,
 Kentucky, in 1796, and requested to be buried on the
 banks of the Ohio,

 1 ( where the song of the boatman would enliven the stillness
 of his resting-place, and the music of the steam engine would
 soothe his spirit."

 "The day will come," he said, "when some more powerful
 man will get fame and riches from my invention ; but nobody
 will believe that poor John Fitch can do anything worthy of
 attention."

 I am indebted to Mrs. Thomas A. Johnson, of this
 city, for the information that the machinery for Eum-
 sey 's boat was made at the Catoctin Furnace, by her
 great-great-grandfather, Col. Baker Johnson.

 Col. Johnson's brother, Thomas Johnson, then Gov-
 ernor of Maryland, was present with General Wash-
 ington at the experimental trial of Eumsey 's boat on
 the Potomac on March 14, 1786.

 The boat was built by Eumsey at Shepardstown ;
 it was eighty feet long and attained a speed of four
 miles an hour against the current.

 Afterwards the machinery was taken back to Catoc-
 tin and for many years the cylinder, four inches in
 diameter, stood three feet above ground as a boundary
 mark between the Catoctin Furnace property and the
 land of Wm. Johnson.

 When General Washington in 1784 laid aside the
 ease and comforts of a luxurious home for the rough
 hardships of his extended explorations in the wild

 fastnesses of the Alleghanies, Spain had dominion
 over all that vast territory west of the Mississippi,
 afterwards included in the Louisiana Purchase, and
 her emissaries from New Orleans were busily engaged
 in the scattering settlements west of the Alleghanies,
 Kentucky and Tennessee in efforts to detach the in-
 habitants from their allegiance to the feeble attenu-
 ated republic yet in its earliest infancy and gather
 them under the proud banner of Spain.

 General Washington early saw the danger and this

 was one of the reasons for his repeated and persistent
 efforts to discover some available transportation route
 by land or water between the disjointed members of
 the straggling nation.

 It is with this in mind that Hurlburt, that eloquent

 historian, says, referring to Washington :

 "He did not foresee the answer, but he uttered the ques-
 tion first and loudest of all his countrymen and as this one
 explorer turned away from the old ford it was with the
 thought, Washington crossed the Delaware, but not more in
 his country's service than when he splashed across this river
 in this dark vale of the Alleghanies. In the first instance he
 was typically first in war; here he stands typically first in
 peace. The very act shows how broadminded, far-sighted a
 man he was and what were his splendid powers of initiative ;
 no Fabian policy here but rather a fascinating series of
 active, daring plans for the union of a land that was nothing
 except free."

 It would be curious to know what thoughts flitted

 through the mind of this grave, austere man as on his
 onward way he passed by Braddock's lonely grave,
 and Fort Necessity, and Great Meadows, the scenes of
 his earliest military achievements. And then one
 wonders, too, why when passing so near to Greenway
 Court on his return he did not pay a visit to this home

 of his early patron, Lord Fairfax, to whom he was in-
 debted for the first rung in the ladder of his surprising
 career. True, Lord Fairfax had been two years sleep-
 ing "the sleep that knows no waking," but Greenway
 Court had been to Washington a delightful haven
 when life was young and fair. It was Fairfax who
 sent young Washington, at the age of sixteen, to sur-
 vey those great tracts of mountain, valley and wilder-
 ness included in his princely grants, and Fairfax
 might fairly be called the Lord of the Potomac, for
 his patents included a territory large enough and
 rich enough for a kingdom, reaching from the source
 of the North Branch of the Potomac in the Alleghanies
 to Chesapeake Bay.

 And what about Lord Fairfax, whose name is so
 closely connected with the history of the Potomac,
 were it otherwise unknown it is perpetuated in the
 legal and historical records of Virginia as the owner
 of a principality comprising not only what is now
 known as the Northern Neck between the Bappahan-
 nock and Potomac but in addition thereto a territory
 which now includes the fairest portion of old Virginia
 and the Virginia Valley, with its sparkling Shenandoah,
 "beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth,"
 and from thence on beyond the mountains - the
 dreaded mountains, then dark, gloomy and forbidding,
 the hunting ground of fiercest savages, and the home
 of wild beasts and reptiles - now the scene of hum-
 ming industry, puffing railroads, throbbing mills,
 flourishing towns, plethoric farms and granaries and
 tens of thousands of happy homes.

 ton and others

 Quiriough (Potomac) Rivers as they are commonly known
 and called by the inhabitants and description of their parts,
 and Chesapeake Bay. "

 Lord Hopton and the other grantees transferred
 their interests to Lord Culpeper who was Governor
 of Virginia from 1680 to 1683. Thomas the fifth
 Lord Fairfax married Lord Culpeper 's only daugh-
 ter, and their son Thomas the sixth Lord Fairfax, in-
 herited the "Northern Neck," otherwise known as the
 "Fairfax Grant. " In the lifetime of his father con-
 fusion having arisen as to whether the North Branch
 or South Branch might properly be taken as embrac-
 ing the "headwaters" of the Potomac, commissioners
 appointed by King James the Second, in 1733, sur-
 veyed the entire tract, and on their report afterwards
 confirmed by the "council for plantation affairs" and
 the king, it was decided :

 "The boundary ought to begin at the first spring of the
 South Branch of the river Rappahannock, and that the said
 boundary be from thence drawn in a straight line northwest
 to the place in the Alleghany Mountains, where that part of
 the Potomac River which is now called Cohongoroota (North
 Branch) first rises/'

 Commissioners appointed under this decision to run
 the lines after their surveys were completed on Oc-
 tober 17, 1746, planted the celebrated "Fairfax Stone"
 as marking the original source of the Potomac Eiver.
 Mr. Herman Gr. Johnson, editor of the Daily Inter-

 Mountain, writes me that :

 "As a matter of fact the river does have its origin near
 the Fairfax stone, yet the streams flow in two branches from
 a spring in the mountain side about two hundred feet from
 the top of the Alleghanies and both streams flow around the
 historic spot joining about eighty five feet farther down the
 mountain side in a stream not large enough to crowd a one

 inch pipe. The spring spoken of is at an altitude of 3500
 feet.

 From a little distance above the spring the Maryland West
 Virginia State line may be seen for miles, as a few years ago
 when the line was re-run a strip was cleared along it about
 one rod wide.

 The Fairfax stone was built of two rocks placed side by
 side which form a foundation about two feet square roughly
 dressed with a hammer and placed so as to extend about
 eight inches above the ground. Upon this stands a cut stone
 just two feet square and eighteen inches deep, and capped
 off on top to a square of thirteen inches. There has been
 another stone placed on this which has been destroyed. On
 all four sides of the stone are cut the letters F. X. and one

 face is covered with an inscription time has obliterated."

 Lord Fairfax seems to have been a man of varied

 accomplishments. Springing from a distinguished
 race, a graduate of Oxford University, an officer of
 the English army, a patron of literature and the arts,
 fortunate in all else but woman's love, a disappointed
 man when past the prime of life, he deserted old Eng-
 land forever to take possession of his vast inherited
 Virginia estates and bury himself in the western wil-
 derness. For a time he made his home with his rela-
 tive, William Fairfax, at Belvoir, a magnificent estate
 of 2,000 acres, handsome brick mansion, servants ' hall,
 cellars, offices and stables, after the best manner of
 the wealthy Virginians of Colonial days.

 Belvoir, destroyed by fire during the Eevolutionary
 War, was situated on the high promontory, now known
 as Stony Point, at the entrance on the right to Guns-
 ton's Cove and nearly opposite Marshall Hall. Fifty
 years ago it was the favorite summer excursion place
 for Washingtonians ; but now sleeping in solitude, no
 sounds but those of the wild birds, the plash of waves
 on its lonely wooded shores or the rush of passing

 steamers disturb the repose where once the generous
 hospitality and echoing mirth of the Virginia planter
 reigned supreme. The old fishermen who ply their
 trade in those waters will tell you the place is haunted,
 and that often at midnight, from far up in the deep
 recesses of its forests, may be heard the plaintive
 notes of a bugle breathing out soft, uncanny strains of
 wild, unfamiliar music - a lament, they insist, over the
 desolation which swept away so much of joy and
 beauty. Belvoir was about midway on the Eiver Po-
 tomac - here seen in its most charming guise - between
 George Mason's stately Gunston Hall, still spared to
 us, and Mount Vernon. Lawrence Washington, the
 elder and favorite brother of George and the owner of
 Mount Vernon, had married the daughter of the pro-
 prietor of Belvoir. Naturally Washington, then a
 stripling of sixteen years, was often found at that at-
 tractive spot, and there he formed the acquaintance
 and gained that friendship of Lord Fairfax which was
 to exercise so great an influence in shaping his des-
 tinies. There in the winter of 1747-48 they hunted the
 fox together and hunted him hard.

 Mr. Lodge writes:

 "They engaged in all the rough sports and perilous excite-
 ments that Virginia life could afford, and the boy's bold and
 skillful riding, his love of sports and his fine temper com-
 mended him to the warm and affectionate interest of the old

 nobleman. ' '

 On the Valley turnpike, twelve miles southeast of
 Winchester, there stands at the intersection of cross-
 roads, in the center of a pleasant little village, a plain,
 solid white post some eight or ten feet high. Strange
 stories are told about that post. One venerable
 " uncle" gravely assured me that if one made a wish
 as he touched that post at midnight the "wish sure

 enough come true." Others tell of buried treasure at
 its base, or of a dead soldier sleeping there, and many
 there be who in passing fail not to touch the post "just
 for luck." Yet the story of White Post is simple
 enough. Lord Fairfax, "tiring of the sound of festivi-
 ties at Belvoir, sought the solitude of the wilderness.
 At Greenway Court, in the midst of his vast posses-
 sions, he established himself in comparative seclusion,
 and this white post he planted as a guide to his dwell-
 ing, one mile distant. He intended to erect at Green-
 way Court a series of buildings on an extensive scale,
 only one of which was completed, in which he lived and
 died - a single clapboarded story-and-a-half house,
 surrounded by about one hundred and fifty negro ser-
 vants, who lived in log huts scattered about in the
 woods.

 He was a dark, swarthy man over six feet high and

 of great personal strength. Howe says :

 ' ' He lived the life of a bachelor and fared coarse, adopting

 in that respect the rough customs among whom he was.
 When in the humor he was generous - giving away whole
 farms to his tenants and simply demanding for rent some
 trifle ; for instance, the present of a turkey for his Christmas
 dinner. ' '

 He was an intense Eoyalist, and the surrender of
 Cornwallis is said to have broken his heart, for he
 died soon after and was buried under the communion
 table of the old Episcopal Church in Winchester. He
 never married, and devised a large portion of his es-
 tate to the Eev. Denny Martin, a nephew in England,
 on condition that he would apply to Parliament for an
 act authorizing him to take the name of Fairfax which
 was done. He devised Greenway Court Manor con-
 taining ten thousand acres and a large part of his
 slaves to another nephew, Col. Thomas Bryan. That

 portion of his estate devised to Denny Bryan was
 afterwards purchased by what we now call a syndi-
 cate made up by Chief Justice Marshall, Ealeigh Col-
 ston and General " Light Horse Harry" Lee. It com-
 prised the Manor of Leeds, located in the counties of
 Culpepper, Faquier and Frederick, containing 150,-
 000 acres; the Manor of South Branch in Hardy
 County, 55,000 acres; Patterson's Creek, in Hamp-
 shire, and Groony Eun Manor in Shenandoah, 13,000
 acres, and these estates we are told have been the
 cause of more litigation than all the other estates in
 Virginia put together.

 In 1781 at the age of 92 Fairfax passed from the

 ranks of living men.

 And so drops out of our picture the eccentric and
 picturesque figure of the Lord of the Potomac, once
 the friend of Addison, the petted darling of London's
 gilded court circles and the victim of unrequited love.
 He left no lasting impress on the destiny of Virginia,
 except for his one great achievement, the discovery of
 George Washington. So many pleasant and interest-
 ing inlets and byways lead away from our lovely Po-
 tomac that the student of its history is continually
 tempted to wander away from the main thread of his
 purpose and linger over what may seem trivialities.
 Let us return again to our old friend John Smith

 and the Lower Potomac* I like John Smith and love

 to linger over the quaint pages of his curiously spelled

 * I had supposed before reading Mr. Hugh T. Taggart 's interesting
 paper "Old Georgetown", published in vol. 11, The Kecords, 1908, that
 Smith was the first to discover the Potomac. Mr. Taggart has delved deeply
 into the subject, and one is forced to adopt his conclusions that the honor
 probably belongs to Father Segura, Vice-Provincial of the Jesuit Order,
 and his little company who are said to have made a settlement at Occo-
 quan in 1570, thirty years before Smith's exploration. This little settle-

 ment was speedily exterminated by the Indians and to Smith belongs the
 credit of the first exploration.

 diary. There be those who say John Smith was a
 great liar, but then there are those not always in
 humble stations who say that of every man who has
 won a name for himself. Be that as it may, Divine
 Providence endowed this sturdy, rugged sailor of ours

 "Within (the capes Henry and Charles) is a country that

 may have the prerogative over the most pleasant places
 knowne for large and pleasant navigable rivers; heaven and
 earth never agreed better to frame a place for mans habita-
 tions were it fully inhabited by industrious people. There
 are mountaines, hils, plaines, valleyes, rivers and brookes, all
 running most pleasantly in a faire Bay (Chesapeake) com-
 passed but for the mouth (the capes) with fruitsome and
 delightsome land."

 Can our modern writers draw a finer picture? He

 tells us this

 "Bay lyeth North and South in which the water floweth
 near 200 myles and hath a channel for 140 myles of depth
 between 6 and 15 fadoms holding in breadth for the most
 10 or 14 myles. [Chesapeake Bay.]

 "From the head of the Bay to the Northwest the land is

 mountainous and so in a manner from thence by a southwest
 line, so that the more Southward, the farther off from the
 Bay are these mountains. From which fall certain brookes
 which after come to five principal navigable rivers. These
 run from the Northwest into the South east and so into the

 West side of the Bay, where the f alle of every Eiver is within
 18 or 20 myles one of another."

 Here we have the earliest recorded description of
 the Appalachian range and water shed, which he
 says is :

 "Covered with much snow and when it dissolveth the

 waters fall with such violence that it causeth great inunda-
 tions in some narrow vallies which is scarce perceived being

 once in the rivers. These Waters wash from the rocks such

 glistening tinctures that the ground in some places seemeth
 as guilded, where both the rocks and the earth are so splendent
 to behold that better judgments than ours might have been
 persuaded that they contained more than probabilities. "

 John Smith was half right; "better judgments than

 ours" have been persuaded to their cost that those
 shining rocks and sands around the Potomac "con-
 tained only probabilities."

 Describing the five navigable rivers, Smith enumer-

 ates the Powhatan (James), navigable for "150
 myles," Pamaunkee, navigable "50 or 70 myles,"
 Toppanock (Rappahannock), navigable " some 130
 myles" and then we come to our own Potomac (Pota-
 womeke) "6 or 7 myles in breadth and navigable 140
 myles. " " The Potawomeke, ' ' he tells us, i i is inhabited
 on both its sides. First on the south side at the very
 entrance by Wighcocomoco 130 men. Two other tribes
 on the same side and then come the Potawomekes 200

 men," located as near as can be gathered from Smith's
 map on the Eastern shore of the Potomac opposite
 Occoquan. The last and uppermost tribe on the
 Potomac Nacotchtaukes, where he says:

 "The river above this place maketh his passage down a low
 pleasant valley overshadowed in many places with high rocky
 mountains from whence distil innumerable sweet and pleasant
 springs. ' '

 In poring over the quaint pages of John Smith's
 "General Historie of Virginia" and the modernized
 but equally interesting leaves of General Washington's
 Diary one cannot but be continually impressed with
 the many points of resemblance in the characteristics
 of these two remarkable men, whose names will ever
 be inseparably associated with the early history of the
 Potomac. Both were natural born explorers, insensible

 to hardship, fearless of danger, masters of men,
 natural leaders.

 Well might Eichard Pots Clarke of the Council

 write of Smith :

 "What shall I say but thus we found him, that in all his
 proceedings made justice his first guide and experience his
 second ever hating baseness, sloath, pride and indignitie more
 than any danger; that never allowed more for himself than
 his soudiers with him ; that on no danger would he send them
 where he would not lead himself; that would never see us
 want ; what he either had or could by any means get us ; that
 would rather want than borrow, or starve than not pay ; that
 loved action more than words, and hated falsehood and
 covetousness worse than death; whose adventures were our
 lives, and whose losse our death. ' '

 This would seem to be a very fair picture of Wash-
 ington at Valley Forge. It was in June, 1608, that
 Smith and fourteen companions set out on their ven-
 turesome voyage of exploration of Chesapeake bay and
 its tributary rivers.

 In an open barge, of only three tons burden, these

 hardy mariners for months underwent a series of ad-
 ventures and hardships almost without parallel.
 Assailed by hostile Indians on land, swept by hurri-
 canes and mighty waves on sea; mast and sail blown
 away; bread and provisions watersoaked and rotten;
 men exhausted with rowing and bailing their frail
 craft, it was no wonder that at last they rebelled and
 refused to go farther.

 The indomitable leader rose to the occasion, and
 infused the sorely tried sailors with some of his daunt-
 less courage.

 "You cannot say," he tells them, "but I have shared with
 you in the worst that has passed and forwhat is to come of
 lodging, dyet or whatsoever, I am content you allow the worst

 part to myself. As for your fears that I will lose myself in
 these unknown large waters or be swallowed up in some
 stormie gust; abandon these childish fears for worse than is
 past is not likely to happen, and there is as much danger to
 return as to proceed. Eegain therefore your old spirits for
 return I will not (if God please) till I have seen the Massa-
 womekes, found Potawomeke or the head of this water you
 concede to be endless."

 So repairing their sail with their shirts the brave

 fellows pushed on to final success.

 When one recalls the fact that in these modern days
 the stoutest seagoing steamers not infrequently have
 to struggle for safety in the fierce tempests that sweep
 over the broad waters of the Chesapeake, the wonder
 is that there was left a single survivor from that frail
 little craft.

 Bancroft, in his history of the United States, thus

 speaks of this wonderful voyage :

 "With a few companions over whom his superior courage
 rather than his station as a magistrate gave him authority,
 and embracing a navigation of nearly three thousand miles.
 The slenderness of his means has been contrasted with the

 dignity and utility of his discoveries and his name has been
 placed in the highest rank with the distinguished men, who
 have enlarged the bounds of geographical knowledge and
 opened the way by their investigations for colonies and com-
 merce. He surveyed the Bay of the Chesapeake to the Sus-
 quehanna and left only the borders of that remote river to
 remain for some years longer, the fabled dwelling place of a
 giant progeny. The Patapsco was discovered and explored
 and Smith probably entered the port of Baltimore. The
 majestic Potomac, which at its mouth is seven miles broad,
 especially invited curiosity, and, passing beyond the heights
 of Mt. Vernon and the City of Washington, he ascended to
 the falls above Georgetown. Nor did he merely explore the
 rivers and inlets. He penetrated the territories and estab-

 lished friendly relations with the native tribes for future
 beneficial intercourse. The map which he prepared and sent
 to the company in London is still extant and delineates cor-
 rectly the great outlines of nature."

 Of this map, Marshall in his life of Washington says :

 "He brought with him an account of that large part of the
 American continent now comprehended in the provinces of
 Virginia and Maryland, so full and exact that after the
 progress of information and research for a century and a
 half, his map exhibits no inaccurate view of both countries
 and is the original upon which all other subsequent descrip-
 tions have been formed."

 True argonauts were these lusty sailors. Jason and
 his fabled band of heroes searching for the golden
 fleece were no braver, no truer men. This frail little
 craft as it rode the stormy billows of the Chesapeake
 and penetrated each cove and inlet of its bays and
 rivers was the white winged advance courier of a
 mighty civilization. A second Jason indeed!

 "And when the first bold vessel dared the seas,

 High on the stern the Thracian raised his strain,

 While Argo saw her kindred trees
 Descend from Pelion to the main;
 Transported demigods stood round,

 And men grew heroes at the sound."

 So, row on ye hardy mariners ! Strange sights has
 the unrolling panorama of the centuries disclosed on
 the historic bosom of the Potomac, where once you
 toiled and suffered. Strange sights - but none stranger
 than that of you and your frail little craft. Warlike
 fleets have swept over these waters; mighty armies
 have trodden its banks ; its bright waters run red with
 heroes' blood; its hills shaken to their very founda-
 tions by the many- voiced roar of murderous cannon.

 But ye are the first in that mighty moving panorama,

 so comrades row ye on. Brave men ye are, rowing
 better than you know. In front the untrodden wilder-
 ness, nameless fears of a fierce, giant, mythical race;
 poisoned arrows of the untamed savage; hunger and
 thirst ; perils by sea and land, by night, by day, perils
 everywhere, but row ye on brothers for trailing in your
 wake one sees through the mists and shadows of a not
 distant future the advance guard of a wondrous civili-
 zation.

 The years roll swiftly on. Our argonauts are gone,
 forgotten; their names were writ in water, all except
 their heroic leader.

 Twenty-five years quickly sped and one bright day in

 March, 1634, there appeared at the mouth of the
 Potomac, a ship freighted with the hopes, fears and
 ambitions of its 300 souls seeking in the yet untrodden
 wilderness to find new homes with the civil and reli-

 gious liberty at that time denied to poor persecuted
 Catholics in old England. Lord Baltimore's colony
 landed at St. Mary's and we are told lived in peace and
 plenty. The settlers had little to do but plant their
 gardens and fields, and wait the coming harvest.
 Within six months the colony of St. Mary's had grown
 into greater prosperity than Jamestown had reached
 in as many years.

 The best of all was the pledges of civil and religious
 toleration were kept to the letter, something that could
 not be said of any other colony in America. As far as
 I can discover this was the first settlement on the
 Potomac. The sites of Alexandria, Bell Haven and
 Georgetown were in the howling wilderness.

 Mr. Snowden in his very interesting treatise on
 "Some Old Landmarks of Virginia" tells us that in
 1699,

 "the whole domain from the Great Hunting Creek to the

 falls of the Potomac, extending inland and embracing six
 thousand acres, had been purchased by John Alexander from
 Capt. Robert Howson for 6,600 pounds of tobacco. At that
 time ST. Marys was far advanced in development and pros-
 perity, the evidences of which are there seen at the present
 day. That country is rich in legend, romance and history
 which some day will be woven into literature and song. ' '

 As the years rolled on, tidewater Virginia and Mary-
 land grew rich and powerful. After the disaster which
 cost King Charles I his throne and head in 1651, many
 of the squires and landed gentry who supported his
 cause sought safety in America. On the banks of the
 James, the Eappahannock and Potomac tBey carved
 out for themselves new homes and lived in comfort and

 peace.

 The eternal struggle between barbarism and civiliza-
 tion had transferred its scene of operations to the head-
 waters of the Potomac, and the midnight warwhoops
 and flames of burning homes no longer disturbed the
 quiet of the " Barons of the Potomac." Gradually all
 along the banks of the James and Potomac sprang up
 stately homes, on princely estates with names reminis-
 cent of old England, which the passing years have
 not yet been able to efface. Some are as familiar as
 household words. Mt. Vernon, Gunston Hall, Belvoir,
 Arlington, Boscobel, Shirley, Westover, Stratford and
 a score of others will not soon be forgotten.

 In the life of George Mason of Gunston Hall, his son
 gives an exceedingly interesting account of the manner
 of living on one of these great plantations.

 "It was very much the practice," he wrote, "with gentle-
 men of landed and slave estates in the interior of Virginia,

 so to organize them as to have considerable resources within
 themselves ; to employ and pay but few tradesmen and to buy
 little or none of the coarse stuffs and materials used by them,

 and this practice became stronger and more general during
 the long period of the Revolutionary War which in a great
 measure cut off the means of supply from elsewhere. Thus
 my father had among his slaves, carpenters, coopers, sawyers,
 blacksmiths, tanners, curriers, shoemakers, spinners, weavers
 and knitters and even a distiller.

 ' 'The woods furnished timber and plank for the carpenter
 and coopers and charcoal for the blacksmith ; his cattle killed
 for his own consumption and for sale, supplied skins for the
 tanners, curriers and shoemakers, and his sheep gave wool
 and his fields produced cotton and flax for the weavers and
 spinners, and his orchards fruit for the distillery. His car-
 penters and sawyers built and kept in repair all of the dwell-
 ing houses, barns, stables, ploughs, harrows, gates, etc., on the
 plantations and outhouses and at the home house. His
 coopers made the hogsheads the tobacco was prized in and the
 tight casks to hold the cider and other liquors; the tanners
 and curriers with the proper vats tanned and dressed the
 skins as well for upper as lower leather to the full amount
 of the consumption of the estate and the shoemakers made
 them into shoes for the negroes.

 "A professed shoemaker was hired for three months in the

 year to make up the shoes for the white part of the family.

 "The blacksmiths did all of the iron work required by the

 establishment and the spinners and weavers made all the
 coarse cloth and stockings used by the negroes, and some of
 the finer texture worn by the white family. The distiller
 made every fall a good deal of peach, apple and persimmon
 brandy. All of these operations were carried on at the home
 house and their results distributed to the different plantations.
 All the beeves and hogs for consumption and sale were driven
 up there and slaughtered at the proper season. My father
 had in his service a white man, a weaver of fine stuffs to
 weave himself and superintend the black weavers and a white
 woman to superintend the negro spinning women."

 and was one of several owned by George Mason, one

 of which, now known as Analostan Island, in his time
 was called Barbadoes. I cannot linger over the
 beauties of Gunston and the history of its illustrious
 patriot and owner. One hundred and fifty years have
 silently gone their way since the argonauts of the
 Potomac disappeared from history.

 The cavaliers of Virginia were resting in peace on

 the banks of the Potomac but on its headwaters was
 fiercely raging the battle for the possession of an
 empire, the rich and boundless territory of the Great
 West.

 George II, King of England, was at war with France.
 The battles of England were to be fought on the fron-
 tiers of Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and for
 the first time the Potomac around its headwaters was
 to be a scene of contest between two civilized nations.
 Already and for years, a trail of fire and blood had
 marked its course from the innocent sufferers of
 Indian warfare.

 At this time the King's son, the Duke of Cumber-
 land, was commander-in-chief of the British army.
 Among his favorites was an officer who had served
 under him with great distinction in the Low Countries,
 distinguished for his bravery, strict discipline, as well
 as dissolute habits. Edward Braddock was for forty
 years or more an officer of the famed Coldstream
 Guards. He was recalled from the command of the
 Fortress of Gibraltar and selected to be commander-
 in-chief of his Majesty's forces in America.

 Poor doomed Braddock! His fateful campaign had
 been planned for him in advance by the Duke of Cum-
 berland. His written instructions were precise, leaving
 no latitude for discretion, no choice of routes. We read
 what a friend of his wrote of Braddock 's last night in
 London.

 "Before we parted last night, the General told me he should
 never see me more, for he was going with a handful of men
 to conquer whole nations and to do this, they must cut their
 way through unknown woods. He produced a map of the
 country saying at the time. - Dear Pop, we are sent like sac-
 rifices to the altar."

 It was a stately war fleet that landed Braddock and

 his gallant army at the wharves in Alexandria early in
 1755. Up to that time the Potomac had known no such
 an imposing array. The day of the argonauts and the
 little three-ton barges had long since past.

 The curtain lifts on a new era in the history of our

 beautiful Potomac.
