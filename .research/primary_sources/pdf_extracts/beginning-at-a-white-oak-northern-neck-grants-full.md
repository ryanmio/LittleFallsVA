If, traditionally, oak is the king of trees, then the white oak could be called the king of kings. Other trees may 
grow taller, but no other tree in the Virginia forests has so great a spread. Branches, often fifty feet long, leave 
the trunk nearly at right angles. White oaks often live to an impressive age of over three hundred years. The 
bark of the tree is light gray and old trunks are divided into flat, broad ridges on which surveyors marks, made 
urith either the broad ax or narrow ax, could easily be seen. The white oak on the cover was drawn from an 
ink sketch by Anne Beresford at Walney. Cover design by Susie Beatty and Bill Sprouse.

To sort out, identify and locate all the early patents 
and grants for Fairfax County and then plot them on a map 
seemed an impossible task. The following people made it 
possible. 

First of all. Nan Netherton had carefully gone through 
the Northern Neck Grants in the Archives Division, Virginia 
State Library, and had selected, by using known streams and 
Fairfax names, grants which were made in the Prince William, 
Fairfax and Loudoun area. This list, when narrowed to 
Fairfax County, served as the basic research tool. It is a 
tribute to the foresightedness of Nan and the Office of 
Comprehensive Planning that such information has been gathered 
and made available to researchers. 

The first time I saw a copy of Robert M. Moxham's The 
Great Hunting Creek Lan d Gran ts I was delighted that such a 
work had been published and impressed with the research that 
made it possible. Bob spent many years researching patents 
and grants in this area. His published works include, in 
addition. T he Colonial Pl antat io ns of Ge o rge M ason , Ea rly 
Colonial Churc hes of Nor ther n V ir ginia , Be l mon t Plantation on 
the Oeco qu an , and "The Re-Discovery of Brandymore Castle." 

A geophysicist in the Isotope Geology Branch of the U. S. 
Geological Survey, he gave permission to use the maps from 
his studies . 

Bob Moxham told me about Donald A. Wise, who was then 
working on a map of land grants in Arlington County. Don, 
who also gave permission to use his map, has written many 
articles on early patents and grants published in The 
Arlington His torical Magazine including: "Arlington Forest," 

"The Henderson House," "A Tour of Historical Sites in Arlington 
County," "Early Land Grants in Arlington County, Virginia," 
and "George Washington's Four Mile Run Tract." Don is Head 
of the Acquisitions Section, Geography and Map Division of 
the Library of Congress. 

Several of the larger tracts in Fairfax County have been 
located as a result of research for books and articles by the 

following authors: Robert S. Gamble, Sul ly : The Bi ography of 

a H ouse ; Eugenia B. Smith, Ce ntr eville, Virginia: Its Histo ry 
and Archit e ctur e; Edith Moore Sprouse, Col che ster: Colonial 
Po rt on th e Po tomac ; Tony Wrenn, Huntley ; Diane M. Rafuse, 
Map l ewo od ; Thomas V. DiBacco, Moorefield , Fairfax County , 
V irgini a; Nan and Ross Netherton, Gree n Spring Farm, and 
Kenton Kilmer and Donald Sweig, The Fairfax Famil y in Fairfax 
C ounty . 

Friends helped locate other key grants on the present map 
of Fairfax County. John K. Gott had researched the boundaries 
for the Turberville grant, Woodberry. Anne Beresford had 
located the Walney plat; Betty Cooke worked with grants along 


vi i 


Georgetown Pike and Janice Artemel had researched the Wren 
grants. All are in the process of preparing manuscripts for 
publication . 

The lines of William Fitzhugh's grant, Ravensworth , were 
fairly well established. The larger grants formed bench marks 
around which the smaller grants could be fitted using: the 
metes and bounds given, either in the original grants and sur- 
veys, or in later deeds. The group of grants which had 
already been researched was a very basic, positive incentive 
to attemnt this project. 

Fairfax County is a great place for serious research in 
local history. Colonial records are available at the court- 
house. Court order books have been indexed and the index is 
available, in part, on microfiche. In the Virginia Room of 
the Fairfax County Library microfilm of the grant books and 
records from counties from which Fairfax evolved are availble, 
along with ah extensive collection of Virginiana. 

The staffs at the Virginia Room of the Fairfax County 
Library, the Virginia State Library, the Virginia Historical 
Society, the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress 
and the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association Library have been 
most helpful. 

The surveys contained in Record of Surveys 17^*2-1856, 
Fairfax County, are a marvelous treasure. Unfortunately, 
the originals have apparently been lost and only negative 
photostats remain. These are extremely difficult to repro- 
duce. Perhaps some day positive, clear copies can be made. 
Most of the surveys used as illustrations were redrawn by 
Susie Beatty of the Mapping Division, Fairfax County. 

Although they are not exact in every detail, all pertinent 
information is given. 

John Lay, Director of the Division of Mapping, Fairfax 
County, has been of great assistance on this project. His 
knowledge of streams, topography, old roads and general 
knowledge of the county, plus his technical advice, have been 
greatly appreciated. The Division of Mapping prepared the 
map, Patents and Northern Neck Grants of Fairfax County^ 
Virginia, for printing.

INTRODUCTION 


The land records of Fairfax County, Arlington County 
and the City of Alexandria, Virginia, extend over a period 
of more than three hundred and twenty-five years. These 
records are fairly complete and are found in the patent 
and grant books and in the court records of the counties 
from which Fairfax and Arlington evolved, i.e., Northumber- 
land, Westmoreland, Stafford and Prince William. 

Present day Fairfax County and Arlington County were 
only small parts of the territory separated from Prince 
William in 17^2 and given the name of Fairfax County. In 
1757 Loudoun County was formed and the eastern dividing 
line between the new county and Fairfax County was estab- 
lished as "Difficult Run, which falls into Potomac River, 
and a line to be run from the head of the said run a 
straight course to the mouth of Rocky Run."^ The line was 
redrawn in 1798 and that part of Loudoun County below or 
southeast of a line from the mouth of Sugarland Run to 
Carter '3 Mill at the confluence of Catharpin Run and Bull 
Run was returned to Fairfax County. ^ 

Arlington County, once a part of Fairfax County, was 
formally organized by Act of Congress 27 February 1801 as 
Alexandria County. Virginia in 1789 offered to cede "ten 
miles square, or any lesser Quantity of Territory within 
the State" to the United States "for the permanent seat of 
the general government." By a proclamation of 2k January 
1791 President Washington directed that a survey should be 
made and in 1791 definite boundaries for the new District 
were established. 3 The Federal county of Alexandria 
remained a part of the District of Columbia until I8U7 when 
it was returned to Virginia, but not to Fairfax County. 

The City of Alexandria was chartered in 1852 and separated 
from Alexandria County in 1870. In 1920 the county was 
renamed Arlington. 

The patents and grants included in this report, there- 
fore, were once located in several different counties, but 
hereafter will be described as being in Fairfax County. 

It is sometimes tedious to differentiate between the terms 
used to describe the acquisition of original title to land 
in Fairfax County, but necessary for a correct description. 
The three ways were: (l) by patent 1651-1690, (2) by a 

grant from the Proprietors of the Northern Neck 1690-1786, 
and (3) by a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia. A 
register was kept of land warrants, numbers 1-2539, for 
lands granted in the Northern Neck from 1786 to 1798. From 
1798 to 1952 the Northern Neck lands were issued on the 
basis of New Treasury Warrants. 

Outside the Northern Neck Proprietary, it is easier to 
describe land acquisitions. Before 1775 patents were 
issued in the name of the Monarch of England and executed 


1 



2 


by his agent, the colonial governor. After 10 October 1779 
grants were issued by the state government and executed by 
the governor. 

In 1948 the records of the Land Office were transferred 
from the custody of the Secretary of the Commonwealth to the 
Virginia State Library. Since 1950 localities have been 
charged with responsibilities of issuing titles to vacant 
lands while the state has issued grants for escheated lands 
only. By an Act of Assembly 5 March 1952 the duties of the 
Register of the Land Office were transferred from the^ 
Secretary of the Commonwealth to the State Librarian. 

Although most of the landowners in Fairfax County held 
title under a Northern Neck Grant, they continued to call 
their lands "patented land," and spoke of their "patents." 

In the grants made in the Northern Neck by the Commonwealth 
of Virginia as late as 1856 , the term "patent" is used to 
describe adjoining land. Fairfax County, however, was a 
part of the Northern Neck Proprietary and was included in 
the 5,282,000 acres of land granted in 1649 by exiled King 
Charles II to seven of his loyal followers. When Charles 
was restored to the throne, the grant was renewed as a 
twenty-one year lease. The lease, however, omitted three 
of the original seven grantees. By the time it was signed 
in 1671 , the lease included six names. 

Thomas, Lord Culpeper, the son of one of the original 
grantees, had been excluded in the renewal. Before the 
final signing, his name and his cousin Alexander Culpeper's 
name were included in the lease. Over the next decade Lord 
Culpeper purchased four of the six leases, and in 1688 a 
grant to the Northern Neck, in perpetuity, was issued to 
Thomas, Lord Culpeper. In this grant the phrasing of the 
western boundaries was changed to "the first heads or 
springs. The boundaries of the grant were not established 
until 6 April 1746 at the conclusion of the lengthy Fairfax 
dividing line dispute. 

After the death in 1689 of Thomas, Lord Culpeper, 
five-sixths of the grant was inherited by his daughter, 
Catherine, who married Thomas, Fifth Lord Fairfax, in 1690. 
Alexander Culpeper died in l6f?3 and left his one-sixth 
share to Lady Culpeper. Lord Fairfax procured a confirma- 
tion of the grant 11 January 1693. 

The first title to land in Fairfax County was a patent 
issued in 1651 to Robert Turney. The patent was based on 
the headright system which awarded fifty acres of land to 
each person who paid transportation costs of an emigrant. 
Patents issued under this system were conditioned on two 
factors--a quit-rent fee and the seating or planting within 
three years. A house had to be built and stock kept or an 
acre of ground had to be cultivated within three years to 
meet the requirements of the patent. ^ Much of the land in 
Fairfax County was not seated, was called "deserted," and 
was then repatented. 


3 


After 1677 no lands in the Northern Neck were patented 
on the basis, of headrights; the "rights" of immigrants were 
sold to be used in Virginia proper. The headright system 
was NOT used in the Northern Neck grants. As a method of 
land distribution, the headright all but ceased by 1715^ 

Many of the early land patents and grants in Fairfax County 
escheated, which meant that since there were no lineal 
heirs of the owner, the land was returned to the Crown or 
to the Proprietor. Another person could then take up the 
land after public notice had been given, pay the composi- 
tion fee set for escheated land (two pounds of tobacco for 
every acre in 1676) and receive title to the land.-^^ 

Although patents issued before l 66 l and in actual pos- 
session of the owners by 1669 were recognized by the 
Proprietors as a result of an agreement in 1669, it was dif- 
ficult to convince the people who had settled in the Northern 
Neck that the title from the Proprietor would be secure. 

There was much confusion over who had legal right to make 
grants and settlement of the upper region of the Northern 
Neck was very slow. During the first twenty years of the 
Proprietary only 292 grants were recorded and few, if any, 
were in Fairfax County. By 1690 the total was only 1,197 

• ... -n 

grants in an area over five million acres. - LL 

Robert Carter was the first agent to substantially 
increase the number of grants. He collected the quit-rents 
efficiently and defended the boundaries of the Proprietary. 
The Proprietors appointed the following men to take care of 
their affairs in the Northern Neck and to see that the land 
was profitably sold so that the quit rents would provide an 
adequate income : 


Thomas Kirton and Edward Dale 
William Aretkin 
Nicholas Spencer 
Philip Ludwell

The Proprietary continued in operation during the 
Revolutionary War. No effort was made to seize the land 
holdings of Thomas, the Sixth Lord Fairfax, since he was 
not considered an alien. He died in 1781 and the 
Proprietary land office was closed. His heirs were 
British subjects and for the next thirty years the owner- 
ship of the Proprietary was disputed. Fairfax family 


k 


interest was terminated in 1808 and the last court case was 
settled in l8l6 by the United States Supreme Court. ^ 

The procedure for granting land was established in 
1690 when Philip Ludwell opened the first of the series of 
thirty-seven volumes of the Northern Neck Grant Books now 
preserved in the Virginia State Library, Archives Division. 
Warrants were sold specifying the exact location of the 
desired land and a surveyor was directed to survey the land 
and return the plat to the agent's office. The person who 
received a warrant could sell his right to the land to 
another individual, either before or after the land was 
surveyed. The plat and any accompanying papers were 
returned to the agent's office after the land had been 
surveyed. If no discrepancies were found and if there were 
no conflicting claims, the agent of the Proprietor issued a 
grant and recorded it in the series of grant books. ^ The 
new owners were obligated to pay quit-rents of two shillings 
for each 100 acres granted to them. If the rents were not 
paid for two years, the Proprietors could cancel the grant. ^-5 
The recorded description of the grant was sometimes 
vague and the owners were often in court to try to clarify 
boundaries or establish a chain of title. This was partic- 
ularly true in the eastern part of Fairfax County where 
most of the land had first been claimed under a patent. 

The surveys for these early patents were not very accurate. 

Early surveyors preferred to make a trip up the river 
and base their surveys on points which could be seen from 
their boat. This is most noticeable in the patents issued 
between 1651 and 1678 for the area which was first described 
as "the Petomack freshes above Piscataway." The land of 
Col. Speake is used as a reference point in twelve of the 
thirty-eight patents issued in 1657. His land was described 
as "in Potomeck River opposite against Miompses Creek." 

After the patents were issued, the land of Thomas Speake 
was granted 8 October l657,to Thomas Brereton by order of 
the Governor and Council. ° 

The first surveys were made using a ship's compass. 
Because it was cheaper, a compass was used to run a needle 
course, especially through wooded country. If early sur- 
veyors had used a true meridian course, the boundaries would 
have remained unchanged when the land was resurveyed many 
years later. Since the land surveys in Virginia were made 
on the magnetic meridian, and since the earth's magnetism 
is always changing, many complications were evident in 
resurveys. The corrected surveys, with variations given, 
were recorded in later deeds. The change in magnetic 
declination is about 2 degrees and 12 minutes every ^0 years. 
Each course had to be changed that much, decreasing in the 
North-East and South-West quadrants, and increasing in the 
North-West and South-East quadrants. ^ 

A typical survey using the ship's compass was the 


5 


Northern Neck Grant of Samuel Wells and Thomas Derrick, 
Jr., for 363 acres: 


Beginning at a pohickory head of Doegs Creek 
opposite great branch. Down Creek East 6 0 
poles. Southeast 24 poles. Southeast by East 
32 poles. Southeast by South 44 poles. South 
by West 6 2 poles. Southeast by East JO poles 
from the mouth of Creek, whence down the bay 
South, Southeast k 6 poles. South by East 120 
poles to point down river, l4o poles to red 
oak near sandy point joining to a little piece 
of sunken ground, into woods Northwest 490 
poles. Northeast by East 124 poles to beginning. 

After 1700 few surveys were made using the ship's com- 
pass. A magnetic compass was used along with a Jacobs 
staff for it to rest upon. Directions were taken by 
degrees and distances were measured by chain lengths 
based upon poles. One pole equals l 6 1/2 feet or one rod. 
(See Appendix A.) 

Lands in Fairfax County were patented using surveys no 
more definitive than the following: 

Beginning at a white oak head of branch that falls 
into Difficult, North 85 ° West 5*+ poles to white 
oak side of branch. South 19° West 220 poles to 
white oak in poison field. South 63° East 110 
poles to red oak on a levell. North 6 ° East 25*+ 
poles to the beginning. ® 


The majority of land grants were more specific and 
named adjacent property owners, streams and roads. 

The important point of the survey was the naming of 
the watercourse, Fairfax County, Virginia, is blessed with 
numerous streams, runs, creeks and rivers; it is fortunate 
that they have remained relatively stable, i.e„, traverse 
the same courses. The streams were once deeper, more swift, 
and played a vital part in the development of the county. 
They were the main "highways” of colonial times; most 
importantly, they were cited in surveys. 

The first patent in Fairfax County was issued to 
Robert Turney in 1651 and was for land "commonly called or 
known by the name of the Doggs Island." It was also 
described as "abutting Sly upon Potomeck Riv. Ely upon a 
great marsh, Wl^^pon a bay and Nly upon a creek issueing 
out of sd. bay. " Doegg’s Island Creek, or Island Creek of 
later patents, was Gunston Cove. By 1669 the bay was known 
as "Poehick Creek" and Accotink was known as the "main run 
of Poehick Creek." In I 69 I+ Acquotink Run was first used in 
a patent and then the other stream that emptied into Poehick 
Creek assumed the name of the bay and became Pohick Run.

Pohick was also sometimes called Island Creek. 2 ® 

In 165 I+ Occoauan was named and recorded as "Ohoquin." 
In 1657 "Ac quaconde river called the Western Branch" was 
used. By 1690 it had become Occkaquann and in 169 ^ it was 
spelled Ocaquon. Later clerks would spell the river many 
different ways. 

The stream later known as Little Hunting Creek was 
mentioned in patents as early as 1657 , hut the name was 
first recorded in 1675 by Nicholas Sp encer, From 1669 to 
169 ^+ Great Hunting Creek was known as Mussel Creek or 
Indian Cabbin Creek. After 1695 Great Hunting Creek was 
commonly used. 

The name Four Mile Creek, which had been identified as 
early as 1657 as the second creek above Piscataway , was 
first used in a grant of 1706 and was named ^|cause of the 
distance between it and Great Hunting Creek. 

John Holmes was one of the men of Stafford County who 
claimed protection under the general amnesty offered by 
the Crown in 1677 after Bacon’s Rebellion. He owned land 
on Accotink in 1692 and on Hunting Creek in 1697. It is 
most likely that Holmes^un, mentioned in patents of 1726, 
was named for this man. 

John Pimmett purchased 150 acres from Robert Alexander 
in 1687 . In 1692 Sampson Darrell referred to his "frontier 
plantation at Pimmits." Pimmit 1 s Run is marked on Gooch’s 
map of 1731. 23 

Other runs which were probably named after settlers or 
the person holding title to the land include: 


Scotts Run - Alexander Scott

Most of these streams still bear 
patents and grants. Other names

d with each clerk or 
d would sometimes change 
pelling of surnames. The 
r, had become standardized 


8 


by the time Fairfax became a separate county in 17^2. The 
knowledge of the location of watercourses of Fairfax County 
is very important in locating the patents and grants. 

The most commonly used boundary marker was not as 
permanent as the streams. For over two hundred years in 
Fairfax County a landowner or tenant was dependent on his 
ability to recognize certain species of trees in order to 
identify his property or to check a survey of his patent or 
lease. The trees mentioned in the surveys were usually 
marked with initials or other identifying marks which were 
cut into the bark to indicate a line or corner tree. These 
marks were renewed every three or four years by a proces- 
sioning of the land. This procedure was authorized by the 
vestry of the church and was instituted to establish boun- 
dary lines. Owners of adjacent property would meet with 
two members of the vestry, check the boundaries, and renew 
any marks on the trees which were used as markers. After 
three processionings without controversy, the boundaries 
were considered established. 

The oak tree was most often used as a beginning tree, 
line tree, or corner tree. It wasn't enough to say "oak 
tree." Early surveyors in Fairfax County were able to 
classify at least eleven kinds of oaks: white, pin, black, 
box, red, Spanish, water, chestnut, live, grey, and ring 
oak. 

Other trees mentioned in the early records include: 
chestnut, poplar, pine, pohicory (pickhickory , hiccory), 
maple, sweet gum, black gum, beech, birch, elm, locust, 
sycamore, ash, and black walnut. (See Appendix B. ) 

Oaks, particularly white oaks, were chosen by surveyors 
for their long life and durability. When, in the natural 
course of time, the tree died, the survey of the property, 
if sold or leased, would then read "to the stump of a white 
oak." Later the same place might be described as "where 
once stood the stump of a white oak." Most often a new 
tree or trees would be added to the description "to three 
Spanish oaks and a hiccory sapling near where once stood 
the stump of a white oak." 

A "poyson" field was mentioned in many early deeds. 

This simply was a field that had been burned by the Indians. 

The colonial surveyors knew only that it was a cleared field 
and the name poison field probably was a result of their 
speculation on the reason for the lack of trees. 

Parcels of rocks, hammocks of pines, glades, guts, levels, 
and springs were other natural markers which were used to 
identify the land being surveyed. Later surveyors noted 
roads, houses, quarters, tobacco houses, fences, corn fields, 
mills, churches, schools and the courthouse of Fairfax 
County . 

Most of the early landowners understood the principles 
of surveying and were keenly aware of the importance of 
having an accurate survey and clear title. The men appointed 


9 


as county surveyors were responsible members of the commun- 
ity. They were expected to carry out the orders of the 
courts in cases of controversial property lines which had 
to be surveyed and settled by a Jury. (See Appendix C.) 

Surveyors until the twentieth century had to contend 
with boundaries established from certain "ancient marked 
trees." Now, even though a tree may still be used as a 
reference point in a survey, permanent bench marks have 
been established. In measuring distances there was a 
gradual transition from poles to feet in the twentieth 
century . 

The author welcomes documented corrections in the 
location or bounds of a patent or grant. They will be kept 
on file and noted on a master copy. Any map which relies 
on seventeenth and eighteenth century surveys, which even 
then were recognized as subject to dispute, is necessarily 
arbitrary. Not every transaction on a property, to the 
present time, can be plotted and studied because of the 
time involved and the fact that fourteen of the deed books 
for Fairfax County and many Stafford and Prince William 
County deed books are missing. Some deeds evidently were 
never recorded. The extant Stafford, Prince William, 
Fairfax and Loudoun County deed books for the colonial 
period in Fairfax County have been examined page by page. 

Many questions arose during the initial research 
activity. How was the land settled? How many times did 
the ownership change due to speculation? Which areas of 
the county were more densely settled? How many land 
owners voted and participated in the affairs of the 
county? What effect did the large "absentee" landowners 
have on the development of the county? Hopefully, this 
map will be a research tool that can be used to answer 
these and other questions.

PREPARATION OF THE MAP 


The 197^ base map of Fairfax County, with a mylar over- 
lay, was used to prepare the map. Patents and Northern Neck 
Grants of Fairfax County, Virginia. 

The Hunting Creek area. Mason Neck, Arlington County and 
previously located grants were transferred to the overlay 
from the maps supplied by Robert M. Moxham, Donald A. Wise 
and others. 

The remaining grants were plotted using original 
Northern Neck grant descriptions. Northern Neck surveys and 
surveys and deeds from Fairfax County records. The colonial 
system of metes and bounds used degrees from North or South 
and distances in poles, chains and links. Distances were 
converted to scale and used to plot the grants. Several 
original grant lines in the western half of the county can 
still be seen on the current Fairfax County property map. 

The grants were numbered and keyed to a chronological 
list; these numbers, 1-605* were then added to the alpha- 
betical list of grants. The patents were not assigned 
numbers . 

Robert M. Moxham prepared the maps for the Hunting 
Creek area and Mason Neck by plotting each grant on a 
U. S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle map at a 
scale of 1:2U,000. He used a transparent overlay and 
plotted the metes and bounds given in the original grants, 
modified by later surveys of record. Mr. Moxham used a set 
of aerial photomosaics of northern Virginia made in 1937, 
probably by the U. S. Army Air Corps. The U. S. Geological 
Survey holds a set of prints. Moxham states that he 
treated the grants like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but 
"more often than not they are too long, too short or are 
skewed so as to overlap or leave a gap with their neighbor.” 
His compilations were transferred from the topographic map 
to the Fairfax County base map. 

Don Wise used the 1900 cadastral map of Alexandria 
(now Arlington) County, Virginia, by Howell and Taylor, as 
a base. Using a mylar overlay, he computed and adjusted to 
scale the original grants and land survey plats. Many of 
the land grants used Four Mile Run as their starting point 
or as a convenient boundary. He also found that many of the 
original land surveys coincided with either the existing 
road system of 1900 or with the cadastral land survey 
boundaries on the base map. The north boundary of the 
earliest proven grant in Arlington County, the Howson- 
Alexander 6000 acre tract, still exists as a boundary 
between Rosslyn and the Arlington National Cemetery. 

Using the mylar overlay on the 1976 Fairfax County base 
map, the Fairfax County Division of Mapping prepared the map 
for printing. Melvin Mauck was responsible for the project 


13 


and Bill Sprouse transferred the detail to the final map. 

There were at least 103 patents and 605 grants 
issued between 8 July 1651 and 31 May 1962 for tracts of 
land ranging in size from 4530 sq. ft. to 24,112 acres. 
Including the area now known as Fairfax and Arlington 
Counties and the Cities of Alexandria, Falls Church and 
Fairfax, the project area consists of 446 square miles.

Patent. Patents are given with the number of the 
patent book and page number plus a brief descrip- 
tive phrase. These are from the abstracts made by- 
Nell Marion Nugent in Cavaliers and Pioneers . 

Mrs. Nugent states that abstracts of Patent Books 
Nos. 4 and 5 were made from "Old Volume 5" which was 
then withdrawn from general usage. She gives the 
page number for Old Volume 5 and then, in brackets, 
gives the page of the transcripts. The numbers in 
brackets were used for references in this listing 
for Fairfax County. The originals of the patent 
book may be found at the Virginia State Library, 
Archives Division. 

Northern Neck Grant. There are five books numbered 
1-5 and then the alphabet is used, including a 
second series. Northern Neck books 5 and E are most 
helpful because the agents for the Proprietors, 
Thomas Lee with book 5 and William Fairfax with book 
E, made a practice of including plats with grants. 
These two books are the most helpful of the entire 
series. The originals of the Northern Neck grant 
books may be found at the Virginia State Library, 
Archives Division. 

Land Office Grant. The originals of the Land Office 
grant books may be found at the Virginia State 
Library, Archives Division. 

Loose Survey. These surveys are from the Northern 
Neck Loose Surveys for the period 1722-1874. The 
originals are at the Virginia State Library, 

Archives Division.

The number at the left of the name corresponds to the 
number in the chronological list and is the circled number 
on the map. 

All patents and grants issued in two or more names are 
indexed under each name with a notation to see the first 
name . 

The spelling of names and place names varied widely. Names 
are given as they are spelled in the various documents. 

The biographical material is not complete, but is given as 
background to try to establish patterns in the land trans- 
actions. The following primary sources were used: 

1. List of tithables of Truro Parish, Fairfax 
County 17^8/9 made by the Rev. Charles Green. 

2. List of voters in 17^, 17^8, 1755 , 1765 and 1768 
3* Rent Rolls of Fairfax County for 176U, 1770, 1772 

and 177^. 

4. Glassford Company papers: Colchester, Virginia 

1759-1769 and Alexandria Virginia 1765-1768. 

5. Minutes of the Vestry, Truro Parish, Virginia 
1732-1785. 

Many of the early deeds followed the English custom of con- 
veying property by two instruments, a deed of lease and a 
deed of release. The lease usually was made in consideration 
of five shillings. The release gave the purchase price and 
was dated one day after the lease. This method of double 
conveyance was used until the time of the Revolution. Most 
dates and citations given in this book are for the release, 

16 


or second part of the conveyance, so that the purchase price 
could he given. Deeds may cover many pages, but the cita- 
tion given is usually for the first page of the release. 

The dates of the patents and grants have been transcribed as 
they appear on the document. Prior to 1752 *the dates were 
given according to the Julian calendar. In 1752 Britain 
finally adopted the Gregorian Calendar which had been 
designed in 1582 to correct the errors of the Julian calen- 
dar. At that time 10 days were removed from the calendar. 
(Example: 15 November became 25 November.) In addition, 

the new year, which had formerly been reckoned from 
25 March, began on 1 January. It is important to be aware 
of this change because the surveys were made before the 
grants were issued, not after, as some dates indicate. In 
some instances dates are given with a slash to indicate the 
change of years. An understanding of these facts is crucial 
when examining dates in the chronological list between 
1 January and 25 March before 1752. For example, the date 
of John Warner's survey for Robert Carter, Junr.'s 3500 
acre grant, NN C:39, is k December 1729. The grant, 
however, is dated 2 March 1729 which was actually 2 March 
1730 due to the 25 March New Year Day.

NE side of Accaquon Creek. Boren (Bourne, Brown) sold 
the patent to William Harris and Thomas Baxter 
12 November 1668 and it was patented by Harris and 
Baxter 10 October 1670 as part of a 3000 acre patent. 
William Harris sold 625 acres, more or less, to

By various conveyances the 625 acres "came to one 
Elizabeth Spencer who by deed bearing date the two and 
twentieth day of February 1691 sold and conveyed the 
same to Giles Traverse, father of said Millian party 
of these presents to whom the said Giles by his last 
will and testament in writing dated first day of June 
1717 devised and bequeathed the same . . ." Millian 

was the wife of Joseph Waugh and they made a lease 
15 April 1732 to James Baxter. In the lease it states 
that the tract was then in tenure occupation and posses- 
sion of Evan Thomas, Andrew Smarr and Joseph Waugh. 
(Prince William Deeds B:l4l. Hereafter appears as 
Pr . Wm . Deeds )

James Baxter and Elizabeth, his wife, of Cecil County, 
Maryland, conveyed 8 January 1747 the remaining term 
of the lease to John Graham for £ 85 . (Fairfax Deeds 
B:349. Hereafter appears as Fx. Deeds.) Graham 
"delivered back" the lease to James Baxter

William Bayley, or Bailey, acquired the lower part of 
the Boren patent from Travers Waugh. (RS 2:26) In 
his will he devised to his son, Samuel, who mortgaged 
the land and 27 October 1810 sold 376 acres, less 
10 1/2 reserved for Bailey, to Samuel Dean of 
Alexandria. (Fx. Deeds L2:155) Tholemiah Berry owned 
the land by 1813. The tract was divided in half after 
his death in 1825 and was sold to James Potter and John 
Allison in 1849. (Fx. Deeds R3:l47) See Sprouse, 
Colchester , pp. 109-110. 

The upper part of the Boren patent was sold to Ralph 
Clifford 8 March 1669 . Clifford died intestate and 
the 500 acres descended to Elizabeth, his only 
daughter, who "intermarried with one Beach." 

Elizabeth Beach, widow, sold the land 24 March 1692 to 
George Luke. Luke, in his last will and testament 
12 December 1731, devised the 500 acres to his wife, 
Elizabeth Luke, who in her will devised to John Popiatt 
Popiatt sold 18 March 1746 to John Graham for £150 
sterling. (Fx. Deeds B:210) 

However, Elizabeth Luke, "of Hamptontown but now of 
Willi amsburgh , " sold to George Mason of Stafford 
County for £10 one half, 500 acres, or the upper half 
of the Bourne Patent of 1666. Mary, widow of George 
Luke, relinquished her dower. (Stafford County Deeds 

1722-1728, p. 316) 

Peter Wagener purchased the upper part from John Graham 
in March 1753 for £300 and it remained in the Wagener 
family until after the Civil War. The tract was sur- 
veyed 7 August 1729 by John Savage and was found to con 
tain 703 acres rather than 1000. (PLC 1:22) It was 
divided into two parts, each of which contained 351 1/2 
acres. The town of Colchester was built on the land of 
Peter Wagener. See Sprouse, Colchester , pp. 109-110.

BRENT 




4 


Margaret Brent was the first woman in America to hold 
large land grants in her own name. She had extensive 
business interests and governed a manorial estate. Named 
executrix by a Colonial governor, she also was the only 
administratrix of a Lord Proprietor’s revenue and was the 
first woman in America known to have asked for a vote. In 
Fairfax County she is especially remembered as the original 
patentee of the land whereon the town of Alexandria was 
later built. 

Margaret Brent and her sister Mary migrated to Virginia 
from Maryland with their brother Giles Brent in 1651. They 
were the children of Richard Brent, Lord of the Manor of 
Admington, Lark Stoke in Gloucestershire, England. Giles 
married Kittamagund, the daughter of the Tayac of the 
Piscataway Indians. In Virginia he patented land near that 
owned by the Indian relatives of his son, Giles, Jr. Giles 
Brent called his Aquia Creek plantation Peace. Eis will 
was dated 31 August 1671. 

Giles Brent, Jr., had a son, William Brent, and two 
daughters, Margaret and Mary. Margaret married George 
Plowden of St. Mary’s County, Maryland, and had a son 
Edmund Plowden. Mary married John Nuthal, also of 
St. Mary’s County, and had a son Brent Nuthal. Edmund 
Plowden and Brent Nuthal sold 22 May 1727, for £^0 each 
their rights and interest in a Brent estate in Virginia. 

The property was not described, but the purchaser of the 
rights was George Mason. (Stafford County Deeds 3722-3727, 
P. 397) 

The George Brent who patented land in Fairfax is 
usually styled "of Woodstock" and was a nephew of the first 
Giles Brent. He migrated from England directly to Stafford 
County. George Brent was the King's Attorney in 1686 and 
in April 1688 he sat in the house as one of the representa- 
tives of Stafford County. The only Catholic member of the 
Colonial lawmaking body of Virginia, Brent was the moving 
force in establishing Brent Town in Prince William County 
which was designated as a "sanctuary for people of all 
religious faiths." ( Prince William, The Story of Its 
People and Its Places” l6 ) 

Margaret and Giles Brent had their land repatented less 
than ten years after their original patents. George Brent 
took his first patents in 1677 and prudently had them con- 
firmed as Northern Neck grants. The grants were recorded 
during the period of time when he and William Fitzhugh were 
agents of the Proprietors, but it is carefully recited in 
the grant that he took uo the land in 1677 and the patent 
was granted by Herbert Jeffrey since there was not an 
office for the Proprietary open. Jeffrey was Governor of 
Virginia and granted under the seal of the colony. When the 
office of the Northern Neck Proprietors was opened by 


26 


Philip Ludwell, George Brent went to the office and sued 
for a new deed. The deed could not be issued because "our 
said agent was gone for England and all the blank deeds by 
him sealed were gone . . (NN 2:111) 

The will of George Brent, Jr., is dated 1 September 
1700. (Stafford Will Book Z:46) He gave to his brother 
Robert Brent the 555 acre tract called Budgeon whereon 
Thomas Thompson was tenant and stated that there was a 
rent charge upon it of 500 pounds of tobacco per year for 
three years "laid by my father in his will" to be paid to 
Robert King. This 1694/5 grant began at a white oak at the 
foot of a hill on the south side of the house and is the 
only tract given a name— Budgeon, or Budgens. (NN 2:115. 

P 6:626 also mentions the "howse." In 1743 Henry Brent 
lived on the 555 acres "near midway of South line." RS 1:4) 
George Brent, Jr.'s brother Henry received 400 acres of 
Hunting Creek land, part of a greater tract whereon Robert 
Williams was tenant. Brother Robert also received 400 
acres of the same tract and brother Nicholas was to receive 
the residue of the land, or 343 acres. Henry's part was to 
be laid out first and he was to possess it at eighteen. 

To his sister Elizabeth, who intermarried with 
Mr. Thomas Longman, and her heirs forever, George Brent 
gave 200 acres of the 1391 acres lying near Budgens. 

Robert received 200 acres of this tract and Nicholas 400 
acres which were to be laid out first. Henry and sisters 
Mary and Martha were to receive 200 acres each out of the 
same tract. A bequest was made to his sister Elizabeth 
Longman "if she come into the country again" and he gave 
his grey horse to his cousin Thomas Clifton. (A James 
Clifton appeared in Stafford Court Records of 1664. He 
married Ann Brent of Defford, Worcestershire, before he 
came to Virginia in the l650's to take up land adjoining 
that of his wife's uncle. Copeland and MacMaster, The 
Five George Masons , pp. 8 , 12. A Thomas Clifton of 
Stafford County 31 August 1703 made a lease to Mary Watkins, 
widow, of Prince George County, Maryland, and Emme her son. 
The 200 acres leased were part of a tract of land called 
Clifton's Neck lying upon Plumb Tree Point beginning at a 
white oak in Potomack on the east side of a swamp one 
fourth mile below Plum Tree point. The rent was two fat 
capons every Easterday. Pr. Wm. Deeds D:269) 

By 1741 William Clifton was making leases on the Brent 
land and during the next two years he made eight three-live 
leases on a total of 1350 acres. (Pr. Wm. Deeds E:4l6-429 
and Fx. Deeds A:4l) The only early deed found from Brent 
to Clifton was 26 November 1739 when George Brent and 
Catherine his wife of Overwharton Parish, Stafford County, 
sold for £200 to William Clifton of Truro Parish, 500 
acres, the northernmost moiety or half part of tract granted 
Giles Brent September 1654. (Pr. Wm. Deeds D:269)

1773, named as cousins Henry, Ann, William and Robert Brent. 
The latter two were executors of her will. She also named a 
granddaughter, Elizabeth Brent. (Fx. Wills C:224) 

The title to the Brent land was challenged in 1729 and 
1731 when three grants were made in Clifton’s Neck. In 1729 
George Turberville received a grant of 800 acres and 
Alexander MacCarty received 200 acres; in 1731 Catesby Cocke 
was granted 860 acres. (NN C:29, NN D: 31 and NN D:68) 
Across the bottom of the Turberville grant is written: 
’’Memorandum: This land is contained in Clifton’s Neck 

granted formerly to Giles Brent." The survey of the 
Turberville grant shows that it adjoins Giles Brent, 
Cliftons, and Richard Longman. The survey of the Cocke 
grant made by John Warner 6 April 1730 shows adjacent lands 
of: Capn. Turbervile, Wm. Reagen, Thos. Karney and Colo. 

Mason. Jno. Lewis is shown living on Colo. Mason’s land. 

The land shown as Col. Mason’s was patented by Thomas 
Sandiford who, by his will 2h January 1715, devised the 
land to William Darrell and Ann his wife. (Fx. Deeds CillO) 
Ann was the daughter of Col. George Mason. John Lewis 
married Catherine, the widow of Thomas Sandiford, and they 
sold the other Sandiford patent to George Mason. (Stafford 
County Deeds 1722-1728, p. 42) Thomas Carney had a three- 
live lease from William Clifton and William Reagan claimed 
the land formerly granted to Alexander MacCarty. (Pr. Wm. 
Deeds E:4l8. lU August 1741) 

Why Northern Neck grants were made on land that had 
been considered Brent’s land is not clear. In 1757 there 
was a court case, an ejectment suit, between George Brent 
and Samuel Moxley, guardian of John Reagan. (LRLS: 39) 
William Clifton, born 1704, testified that he had not heard 
that George Brent, the patentee, had given away the residue 
of the land in dispute to Longman. Clifton stated that he 
had heard that the land was given to Longman’s wife, who 
was the daughter of Brent, in general tail. No will was 
found and they left no issue. Many of the deponents in the 
suit testified that Reagan had been warned that he was on 
Brent land. Brent was evidently able to prove that his 
claim was valid for in 1760 George Brent, grandson of George 
Brent the patentee, sold the remaining part of the 584 acre 
patent which included the Reagan-MacCarty grants. 

During a twenty-five year period, beginning in 1653, 
the Brents patented a total of 6,173 acres in Fairfax 
County. By 1746 all but 434 acres had passed from Brent 
ownership. In 1760 the remaining part of the 584 patent 
was sold to George Washington. (Fx. Deeds D:84l)

Within the fork of Little Hunting Creek on south side 
of the "howse." Repatented as NN 2:115. (RS 1:4) 

Henry Brent sold this tract to William Clifton 

16 September 1746 for £436 current money of Virginia. 
(Fx. Deeds B:64) The next year William Clifton and 
his wife Elizabeth mortgaged this tract and the 1800 
acre tract granted to Giles Brent, Jr. (Fx. Deeds 
B:292) Charles Carroll of the City of Annapolis was 
the party of the second part and William Digges and 
John Addison of Prince George County, Maryland, were 
the parties of the third part. In 1754 Ignatius 
Diggs, William Diggs and John Addison sold for £660 

to George Johnston land in Clifton's Neck that Clifton 
had mortgaged and did not pay. They excepted the 400 
acre home plantation. Then the same three men sold to 
Thomas Colvill for £200 "land purchased of Henry Brent 
. . . 555 acres." Four days later Johnston and Colvill 

sold the same land back to Ignatius Diggs, William 
Diggs and John Addison. The General Court cancelled 
these deeds and ordered the land to be sold. The 1800 
acre tract was sold to George Washington and the 555 
acres were sold to William Clifton. (Fx. Deeds D:740) 

Two months later, 19 August 1760, William Clifton and 
Elizabeth sold the 555 acres to George Brent and 
Sampson Darrell, in trust for Anne Slaughter their 
daughter and the heirs of her body. (Fx. Deeds D:769) 

The will of Mrs. Ann Slaughter divided the tract be- 
tween her three daughters: Elizabeth Brent Hammersley, 
Eleanor Reeder, wife of Benjamin, and Mary Ann Seymour, 
wife of James Patton. James Patton bought the one 
third owned by Benjamin Reeder and Eleanor his wife. A 
survey was made of the property 4 November 1808 by 
Simon Summers. A division of the property was recorded 

17 August l8ll. According to the survey the tract con- 
tained 640 1/2 acres and was divided into two lots. 

Lot number 1 c ontained 427 acres and was assigned to 
James Patton and Mary Ann Seymour his wife. Lot number 
2 contained 213 1/2 acres and was assigned to Elizabeth 
Brent Hammersley, widow of Francis Hammersley, ded'd.

grandson of George the patentee, sold the major part 
of this tract to George Washington 24 September 1760 


31 


for £194.4.4. (Fx. Deeds D:84l) This deed recites 
that George Brent, the patentee, exchanged 150 acres 
for a like number of acres in another place with a 
certain William Bourne, as by a deed between George 
Brent and William Brown 29 January 1691/2 in Stafford 
County, John Tillet and Mary his wife, daughter and 
heir at law to William Bourne sold 8 November 1698 to 
Giles Vandi c ast eel . Pricilla Hay, daughter and heir 
at law to Giles sold to George Mason lU-15 March 1721, 
(Fx. Deeds Q:2*+9. l 6 June 1786 ) A 1771 lease 
describes the land as purchased by Col. George Mason, 
dec ? d., from James Hay and his wife. (Fx. Deeds K:l 6 ) 
The 150 acre tract was devised to Thomson Mason by 
George Mason of Gunston Hall in his will. Title was 
transferred to Thomson Mason, however, by deed in 
1786 .

Northwest side of Mr. Mathews land on Great Hunting 
Creek. NN2:113 gives the date as 17 November 1677 
and is a regrant of this land. 

The boundaries of this tract were the subject of a 
court suit in 17 I +8 as recorded in RS 1:25A. John 
Minor was the plaintiff and Daniel French son of Hugh, 
was the defendant. Minor claimed 281+ acres under a 
sale from Robert Brent, executor of Nicholas Brent, 

11 July 1715, to John Ball for 3*+3 acres. The will of 
Nicholas Brent in 1711, devised this land to be sold 
for the payment of his debts. 

Robert Brent of Charles County, Maryland, sold 778 
acres to Hugh French for £71.17.6 and 1500 pounds 
tobacco. (19 September 1735. Pr. Wm. Deeds B:13^) 

Daniel French sold 1+00 acres May 17^2 to Richard and 
Robert Sandford. Daniel French in his will l 6 October 
17^8 left his estate for the use of his wife and then 
to Godson Daniel Sanford, his sister Margaret Hansbery 
and Edward Sanford. In 1782 they sold to Josiah 
Watson of Alexandria. Robert Sanford’s 197 acre tract 
became the property of his eldest son, Richard, who 
also sold to Josiah Watson, in 179^. Richard Sanford 
lived on his 206 acre tract until his death in 1799 . 
This tract then passed to Presley Sanford, his 
youngest son, who sold in 1806 to James Hewett Hooe. 
(Preston, "Archives of Burgundy," Historical Society 
of Fairfax County, Year Book , vol. 3:1+0. Also 
RS 2:135) 

In 1797 this tract was again surveyed. The difficulty

in laying out the patent after 125 years is apparent. 
The court case, Herbert and Wife v. Wise , is typical 
of the period and shows the wide variety of interpre- 
tation for one patent. The issue is further confused 
by the introduction of another Brent

However, the suit Herbert and Wife v. Wise and others 
was heard 27 October l"802 in the Court of Appeals of 
Virginia. The Judgment of an earlier court was 
reversed and a new trial was ordered so that the 
plaintiffs would "be permitted to shew, if they can, 
that they have the same title that Ball had." (Call, 
Report s , Vol. Ill, p. 212) In this report the eject- 
ment suit is summarized. 


BRENT, GEORGE 1391 6 November 1677 P 6:626 

Regranted as NN 2:111, this land is mentioned in the 
will of George Brent, Jr., and 100 years later a 
plaintiff in a court case produced a copy of the grant 
and had the surveyor lay it out so that it included the 
lines of the 1143 acre tract. No deeds have been 
found, however, that can be identified as part of this 
tract. The patent identifies it as being at the north 
branch of the fork of Little Hunting Creek at the head 
of Mr. Matthew’s land.

George Brent and Catherine his wife of Overwharton

£200 to William Clifton of Truro 500 acres, the

northernmost moiety of the half part of tract formerly 
granted Giles Brent 165^. (Pr. Wm. Deeds D:269) 

Wo deed has been found for transferring the remaining 
1300 acres to William Clifton, but the property is 
designated Clifton on a survey made in 1738. (L. C. 

Mapping Division) The land was mortgaged in 17^7 and 
sold 17 June 1760 for £1210 by William Clifton and 
Elizabeth his wife. (Ex. Deeds D:762) Because of the 
mortgage, Ignatius Digges and Mary his wife, William 
Digges, John Addison and Susannah his wife Joined in 
making the deed to George Washington. Thompson Mason 
also made an offer to Clifton which was higher than 
Washington's original offer. Clifton wavered, so 
George Washington brought him to court. In his diary 
Washington wrote "Much discourse happend between him 
and I concerning his ungenerous treatment of me, the 
whole turning to little acct. . . . Tis not worth 

reciting here. The result of which was that for £50 
more than Mr. Mason offerd him he undertook, if pos- 
sible, to disengage himself from 'that Gentleman and to 
let me have his Land. I did not think myself 
restrain'd by any Rules of Honour, Conscience, or 
etca. from mak ' g him this offer, as his Lands were 
first engagd to me by the most Solemn assurances that 
any Man could give." (Thane, Potomac Squire , p. 65) 

The I806 acres were added to George Washington's 
Mount Vernon estate and were known as the River Farm.

From Margaret Brent this tract passed to Giles Brent 
who sold to Fitzherbert. George Brent, as attorney for 
Mr. John Fitzherbert, sold the tract to John Alexander 
in 167^. Robert Alexander sold 17 October 1686 to 
Ralph Platt 100 acres "part of greater 700 purchased 
by Captain John Alexander of Captain George Brent." 
Witnesses to the transaction were Robert Brent and 
John West. The deed was recorded 9 December 1686 at 
Stafford Court. The 100 acres escheated and John West 
applied to the Proprietor's office. After the required 
six months waiting time and after he paid the fees, the 
100 acre tract was granted to him as NN 3:15 dated 
16 February 1703. 

The will of John West is dated l6 November 1716. 


35 


(LRLS 166-169) John West willed fifty acres of land 
"being the plantation where John Symmers now lives" 
to Benjamin Blake and fifty acres from the same tract 
to John Blake. John Blake, Planter, of Overwharton, 
Stafford County, sold 9 October 1728 to Simon Pearson 
for £50 land "on Ralph's Creek Joyning to Broadwaters' 
hole on Potomac river" the 100 acres "being the plan- 
tation where John Symmers formerly dwelled and given 
the said John Blake by the last will and testament of 
John West Gent." Many years later Hugh West obtained 
the same 100 acres from Thomas Pearson. John 
Alexander brought an ejectment suit against Hugh West 
in 17 1 * 1 *. (RS 1:6-7) 

In 1763 Sybil West, heir of Hugh West, sued John 
Spinks. She alleged that in 1760 he cut trees on her 
property which were valued at £35. The suit is re- 
corded in Land Records of Long Standing, pp. 155-179. 


Sybil West's attorney showed a place on the 
Potomac river about 150 feet from a dace wh 
Adam's house formerly stood (ca. 1716) near 
the middle of a street in the Town of Alexan 
Queen's street, for the beginning of a tract

The location of a tobacco warehouse at Great Hunting 
Creek had been established by act of the General 
Assembly in 1730 which directed that a warehouse be 
built "upon Broadwater's land." In May of 1732 it was 
reported that Broadwater's land was found to be a very 
inconvenient location and a warehouse "in the room of 
it" was built upon Simon Pearson's land on the upper 
side of Great Hunting Creek. (Hening, IV: 3 3 1 ) 

John Summers, in the West-Spinks suit, told that he had 
been a tenant to John West and the survey showed a place 
"where formerly a tobacco house and orchard stood and 
that first house built above that place was the old 60 
foot warehouse built for Simon Pearson by John Bryan 
and Derby Bryan and further saith that the place showed

estate. See Robert Howsing (Howson) 6000 acre patent.

Francis Coffer, w ho married the widow of William, 
applied for and received NN Grant 5:192 for 520 acres. 

The tract sold to James Heryford was surveyed in 
1695 hv Theodorick Bland and found to contain 47*+ 
acres. It became the estate of James Heryford' s 
eldest son John, who by will 30 June 1743 devised to 
his eldest son James and his heirs 250 acres. James 
died without issue and in his will devised the land 
to be equally divided between his two brothers George 
and Henry. Since George had only estate for life in 
one half of 250 acres, John as eldest brother had the 
right to reversion. John deeded to his brother George 
for £20 125 acres near the mouth of Pohick Creek. 

(Fx. Deeds D:465, 17 August 1757) John also deeded 
the other 125 acres to his brother Henry. (Fx. Deeds 
E : 8 1 , 15 June 1762. John was styled of Cameron 
Parish, Loudoun County.) Henry sold the 125 acres 
the next month to George Mason for £150. (Fx. Deeds

Ann his wife sold for £110 to Henry Heryford 192 
acres nart of their 1930 acre tract. (Fx. Deeds E:97) 

John Heryford, eldest son of John and grandson of 
James, sold the lower Dart of the tract, 236 acres, 
to William Bayly for £306.l6. (Fx. Deeds D:502) An 
extra 22 acres were found and sold to George Mason 
for £28.12. (Fx. Deeds D:640, 27 August 1759) 

(RS 1:34) 

William Bayly, Inspector, and Mary his wife sold for

adjacent to the land formerly in possession of Robert 
Colson now in possession of Col. George Mason, 
commonly called the Hallowing Point tract. 

George Mason, of Gunston Hall, in his will devised to 
his son George all lands between Potomack River, 
Occoauan River and Pohick Creek, including a quarter 
at Hallowing Point on "land bought of William Courts.”

10 August 1698 John Simpson sold 313 acres to John 
West, who devised to his grandson John West in his 
will 16 November 1716, and in default of heirs, to 
son John West. Grandson John died without heirs. 

Son John West sold 17 March 1735 to John Minor. 

Minor sold the property back to John West 25 January 
1750. (Fx. Deeds C:136) 

John Carr sold his half of the patent to Anthony 
Battalia 7 August l 68 l. Battalia sold to John Holmes 
20 March 1682. Thirteen years later John Simpson 
received a Northern Neck Grant for the original 627 
acres; he did, however, confirm Holmes' right to one 
half of the grant by a sale to him 13 October 1697. 
Robert Hedges, who inherited from Holmes, sold to 
Col. George Mason 13 August 1729. George Mason of 
Gunston Hall sold 21 June 1753 to Hugh West for 
£100. (Fx. Deeds C:567 and T:398) 

Hugh West devised to his son John West, Jr., who 
devised to his son Thomas West. In a deed of 1791 
it is stated that Hugh West died seized of the entire 
tract of Carr and Simpson and that John West had de- 
vised the tract of 313 acres to his grandson Hugh 
West. In the will of John West, as recorded in LRLS, 
p. 166 , it states that the 313 acres were devised to 
his grandson John West, and if there were no heirs of 
his body, the tract was to go to his son John West. 

John West, of the Minor to West sale, in his will 
dated 27 March 1776 states that his kinsman John 
West, Jr., was in possession of 313 acres that Hugh 
West recovered of him by a judgment of the General 
Court. John West had appealed and had brought two 
ejectments in order to appeal to England, "but never 
could have the said land valued high enough to bear 
an appeal according to the Royal instruction." West 
instructed his two sons-in-law, John Ashton and Richard 
Conway, to try to recover the land. John Ashton, fol- 
lowing the instructions in John West's will, instituted 
a suit in the General Court 13 October 1786. Edmund 
Randolph was attorney for Ashton and John Marshall 
represented Thomas West. Sybil West, Thomas West's 


hi 


grandmother, presumably as holder of dower rights in 
the realty, joined in the action. 

Randolph claimed that there were no cross remainders 
established by the will of John West the elder. To 
this claim Marshall made three objections: the want 
of possession in John West the son at the time of the 
devise to the plaintiff, the Act of Limitations, and 
cross remainders between grandsons Hugh and John. 

The decision was for West. Thomas West, grandson of 
Hugh West, was in possession of the 313 acres in 1790.

Mr. Draiton and upon a swamp dividing this land from 
land of Col. Humphrey Higgerson. Retaken by new 
rights for transportation of 6 0 persons. The earlier 
patent mentions a swamp near the falls of Occaquon 
river . 


The land lapsed by not seating and was petitioned for 
by William Harris and Thomas Baxter and was afterwards 
granted to the said Harris and Baxter by patent bearing 
date 10 October 1670. James Gregg doubted the validity 
of his title; he stated that he was in possession of 
3000 acres granted Col. Miles Cary in 1657 . Gregg 
applied to have the patent renewed and confirmed to 
him. (NN 5sl69) 

In 17^1 Matthew Gregg of Stafford County and Isaac 
Kent of Prince William County applied to the Prince 
William Court for a partition of their land. In this 
deed it is stated that 13^0 acres of the parcel of 
3000 acres granted to William Harris and Thomas Baxter 
had been sold to several persons. In addition, 750 
acres of a 1200 acre parcel granted to William Harris, 
Thomas Baxter and Burr Harris 25 October 1669 were sold 
or taken into an elder patent. 

There remained within the ancient bounds of three 
thousand acres according to survey 1996 acres and U 50 
acres remained in 1200 acres, both of which parcels 
the said William Harris entered in claiming the same 
by survivorship and died thereof seised. By his last 


will 24 March 1697/8 he devised all his lands above the 
Occoquan to his granddaughters Jane and Ann Owsley, to 
be equally divided between them. If no heirs, land was 
to go to Mary Owsley, and then to grandson Thomas Owsley. 

Jane Owsley intermarried with James Gregg and had a son 
Matthew; Anne Owsley intermarried with Isaac Kent and 
had son Isaac. The partition was made 29 March 174l. 
Matthew Gregg received the 450 acres in tenure and 
occupation of John Keene and William Steward and 773 
acres, the upper part of the 3000 acre tract. Isaac 
Kent received the remaining part of the 3000 acre 
tract. (Pr. Wm. Deeds E:305) 

Benjamin Adams and Elizabeth his wife (late the wife of 
John Gregg late of Prince William, Dec’d. , merchant) 
for £100 sold to John Semple the release of one-third 
part, dower, of a tract on the Occoquan containing by 
estimation 2400 acres which John Gregg seised in fee 
simple and are now in possession of said John Semple. 

(Fx. Deeds 0:1. 5 July 1 7 6 5 )

James Claughton (Cloughton, Clayton) received this 
patent from Samuel Matthews 5 June 1658. He assigned 
one half, or 250 acres of the patent, to Ann Bradshaw, 
daughter of Robert Bradshaw 6 June l66l and the deed 
was acknowledged in Northumberland County Court. 

James Claughton and Ann Bradshaw then obtained a grant 
for 500 acres from Sir William Berkeley 23 June 1664. 

James Claughton and Robert Bradshaw conveyed the 500 
acres to Jeremiah Jadwin 28 August 1673. Jadwin, of 
Westmoreland County, contracted a bargain and sale 
with William Keen, who died before the "enrollment" 
of the land. Keen had paid Jadwin for the land, and 
in his will of 15 October l68l devised the land 
equally to his two daughters Elizabeth and Sarah. If 
either died without heirs lawfully begotten, then the 
whole tract was to go to the survivor and her heirs. 
Jeremiah Jadwin, to complete the bargain made with 
William Keen, deeded the 500 acres 26 March 1689 to 
Elizabeth and Sarah Keen. This deed was recorded 
May 1689 in Stafford County Court. 

Samuel Sanford (Samford, Saniford) of Richmond County, 
and Elizabeth his wife sold to Sarah Keene one half of 
the 500 acres. The sale was made 21 November 1704 and 
the deed was recorded 10 March 1725 at Stafford County 
Court at the request of George Eskridge, in behalf of 
Mr. William Woodbridge. (Stafford County Deeds 
1722-1728, p. 217) 

William Woodbridge married Sarah Keene, who was mother 
of Capt. John Woodbridge and Elizabeth Woodbridge. 

Capt. John died 1769 without legitimate issue. Thomas 
Sandford, reputed heir at law to Elizabeth the daughter 
of William King (Keen?) conveyed to John Woodbridge by 
deed 13 October 1740 one half of the land.

descend to Newton Keen/ 1 (LRLS 302-33*0) 

Richard Lee and David Boyd of Northumberland County, 
the Executors of William Keen, eldest son and heir-at- 
law to Newton Keen and also heir at lav by the mother's 
side of John Woodbridge, sold for £502 one undivided 
moiety of the land 6 March 1775 to Harry Piper. Then 
7 March Harry Piper sold for £502 to David Boyd of 
Northumberland County. (Fx. Deeds M:50) 

The court case filed against Elizabeth Yerby (Yearby) 

27 September 1771 by John West was a means of trying 
title to the land. John West brought suit "in 
Ejectment" which was a personal action between the 
parties and settled only the right of possession. 

The suits were based on a pretended lease by a ficti- 
tious -plaintiff to a fictitious defendant. Usually 
it was John Doe against Richard Roe, but sometimes 
the fictitious parties were given fanciful names 
which expressed the plaintiff's theory on the merits 
of the controversy. In one case Timothy Goodtitle 
filed suit against Francis Wronghead; in another 
Isaac Thrustout filed against Thomas Holdfast. In 
the case of John West and Elizabeth Yerby they were 
styled Solomon Savall and Simpleton Spendall. 

(LRLS 282-330) 

The survey for the court suit is also recorded in 
Record of Surveys, part 1, p. 59, and located the 
patent within the hounds of John Matthew's Patent 
for 1567 acres. In a survey of the same land made 
approximately 1795, the Clayton and Bradshaw patent 
is shown as the property of Augustin S. Smith.

"Dodson was a surveyor and as the Jenkin and Piddel 
patents were assigned to him about three months 
later (Westmoreland Deeds 1:7), I assume that Dodson 
laid out all three tracts. In any event, by August 
1653 Dodson held claim to all of the northwest shore 
of the Occoquan from the mouth (where he interfered 
with Turney) to near State Rt . 6ll. Evidently Dodson 
did not seat these patents and in 1660, citing ill 
health, he gave James Pope his power of attorney 
(Westmoreland Deeds 1:117). No further record of 
these men appears and the Dodson patents were probably 
abandoned." (Moxham, Colonial Plantations , pp. 12-13)

This patent included all of Jenkin's 1000 acre patent 
and most of Dodson 1 s 1300 acres. Part of the tract 
was later included in patents of Collingwood in 1669 
and Whitt and Woorman in 1670 . The latter parcel was 
granted to Thomas Kyrton in 1690 as NN 1:45. Thomas 
Baxter was probably the first to seat this land; his 
son reconfirmed the title in 1703. (Moxham, Colonial 
Plantations , p. 13) 

Drayton deserted his dividend. The Council gave a 
patent 22 October 1670 to Symon Thomas for 2000 acres 
"formerly granted to John Drayton and by him 
deserted." (Moxham, Belmont Plantation , p. 3)

Williams, Ded’d. 


This land was given by will of John Gosnell to 
Flizabeth Ireland and renewed in her name 18 March 
1662. Elizabeth Ireland died without will or heir. 


Granted to William Fitzhugh 5 November 1697 (NN 2:282), 
the land was devised in will to Fitzhugh’s son George. 
William, son of George, inherited the land and in 1787 
was interested in securing the title and establishing 
the boundaries of the uatent. Col. William Fitzhugh 
lived at Millmont , Calvert County, Maryland, and was 
interested in obtaining the opinion of his cousin 
George Mason, of Gunston Hall, about how the patent 
could best be laid out. 


The letter that George Mason wrote 23 February 1787 , 
in reply to Fitzhugh, is reasoned and practical. It 
contains a detailed description of the problems that 
arose in securing colonial land titles. That the 


Fitzhugh problem was of long standing is evident from 
the fact that Mason had acquired a Treasury Warrant 
from Richard Graham for the ungranted land three 
years before the date of his letter. 

Mason was careful to discuss all aspects of the 
problem and was firm in his recommendations. 

Fitzhugh followed his advice and applied for a grant 
using the boundaries Mason had suggested. This grant 
was issued 5 March 1792. Mason assigned his rights to 
the ungranted land to Fitzhugh and a grant was issued 
the same day for the land between Normansell and the 
old patent. 

A copy of the original 1787 letter is in the 
Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress and a 
more exact transcription is given in Rutland, The 
Papers of George Mason , vol. Ill, p. 868. In the copy 
included here, which was transcribed from the photo- 
stat in the Library of Congress, the random capital- 
ization was not transcribed and the letter was 
divided into paragraphs. 


Gunst on Hall Feb. 23, 1787 


Dear Sir 

In answer to your favour of the 9th hy your son 
respecting your Pohick land, I can truly say that no man 
is more disinterested in the business, personally, than I 
am; having no other motive for the concerns I have taken 
in it, but the desire of doing you service, I have little 
more than a common acquaintance with Mr. Wm. Steptoe^: nor 
have I ever considered his, or his brother's interest, on 
this occasion, further than as they appear'd connected with 
yours . 

The difficultys occuring in securing your land and 
assertaining the bounds of it, are not created or increased, 
by the survey I have presented you; which my laying down the 
meanders of the creek and the lines of all the adjacent 
lands accurately, only shows the situation of the lands, as 
they really are, with the exact shape and quantity of the 
land left by the adjacent patents for you and Mr. Steptoe; 
and consequently affords the best means of enabling you to 
judge of the most safe and proper mode of securing your 
lands and preventing present, as well as future disputes. 

There was no occasion, in drawing the plat I sent you, 
for running the line laid down in it as the proposed divi- 
sion between you and Mr. Steptoe; because after an actual 
survey of the creek and of all the surrounding lines, that 
or any other dividing line can be laid down on the plat, 
with the same exactness, as if actually run and measured 
with a chain: the dividing line therefore, not having been 
run, remains unknown to anyone, and is at present nothing 
more than an imaginary line, laid down to make you more 
fully master of the subject, and of the principles upon 
which I recommended surveying Gosnell's old patent for 500 
acres, in the manner I have done; in order to obtain a new 
grant of confirmation for it, in your own name, describing 
the bounds, so as not to interfere with the adjacent patents. 

You will find some circumstances in this affair too 
difficult and mysterious to be unravelled, or accounted for, 
without better lights as evidence, than it is possible, at 
this time of day to procure; they can therefore only be 
guessed at. 

There are three different patents, for 500 acres each, 
granted on the same day to three different people (which I 
sent you copys of) each of them describing the same course 
and distance upon Pohick Creek, and the same courses and 
distances from th'e creek, and binding respectively upon each 
other; one to John Gosnell, one to Peter Smith, and one to 
Thomas Moulton; of these three patents (tho dated on the 
same day) it is evident that Gosnell's patent (under which 
you claim) is the eldest. Smith's the next, and Moulton's 
the last; because Gosnell's patent has no reference to 


50 


to either of the others, Smith's has reference to Gosnell's 
and Moulton’s to Smith's; it is also evident, from the 
descriptions contained in these patents, that Gosnell's is 
the lowest down the creek. Smith's in the middle and 
Moulton's the uppermost; as will be demonstrated, by com- 
paring these patents with each other, and with the course 
of the creek upon the plat: if therefore Steptoe claims 

under either, or both of the two last mentioned patents, 
they have by some blunder in former times (God knows how) 
been misunderstood and misplaced; for your ancient posses- 
sion (Christmas's old tenement, still apparent) is at the 
upper end, high up the creek, within less than a quarter of 
a mile of Normansell's corner, and Steptoe's most ancient 
settlement (which can be ascertained from an old survey of 
Bushrod's patent, about ninety years ago, by Theodorick 
Bland, then the county surveyor) is at the lower end of the 
land, Just above Bushrod's corner upon the creek* 

These circumstances have inclined me to think that 
Steptoe does not claim under either Smith's or Moulton's, 
but under Newberry's patent; which Gosnell's refers to, 
and binds upon, and describes as lying lower down the 
creek; this I don't know that this is the case, nor have I 
any other reason to think it is. 

Mr. Steptoe tells me he knows nothing at all either of 
the bounds or title of his land; having never been able to 
get papers from old Squire Rd. Lee; who was his father's 
executor. 

If it should turn out that Steptoe claims under 
Newberry's patent, then his title is elder than yours, the 
ancient possessions may perhaps be reconciled to the patents 
you respectively claim under, and Smith's and Molton's 
patent which are evidently described as lying higher up the 
creek than Gosnell's and consequently upon Normansell's 
land, have been lapsed and lost, for want of seating, under 
the ancient rules of the Virginia Government; as is the 
case with many hundred old patents in the late Secretary's 
office. 

I know nothing of the quantity or courses of Newberry's 
patent having never seen it, or heard it mentioned, except 
in the recital of Gosnell's patent; that Steptoe may pro- 
bably claim under it is mere guess work, suggested by the 
beforementi oned circumstances. I have however, given your 
son a mem. dm. to get a copy of it from the land office 
where all the old land records are now deposited. 

If Steptoe does not claim under Newberry, then 
Newberry's is one of the before described lapsed and lost 
patents. Upon the whole it seems clear that no person but 
yourself and Steptoe, has at present, any manner of title 
to any part of the 960 acres of land lying upon Pohick 
creek, clear of the adjacent patents. 

If Mr. Steptoe claimed under Smith's or Moult oun's 


51 


patents (which it has been generally presumed he does) 
then they have not only beee misplaced as before mentioned; 
but it is impossible to lay them, or your’s off, according 
to the courses and distances of the patents, without laying 
the greater part of them into elder patents; as will be 
mathmat ically demonstrated to any man, who understands sur- 
veying, and will take the trouble to lay them down unon the 
plat I sent you: neither will they include one half the 
land left out by the adjacent patents; for the adjacent 
patents, tho’ they have not left half the distance back 
from the creek, which these patents of Gosnell’s, Smith’s 
and Moulton’s require, yet they have left them more than 
double their distance upon the creek; which is the reason 
the quantity still remaining turns out so much as it does. 

But this is not all; for you will observe, that in 
neither of the said three patents there is any fixed deter- 
minate course; the courses being northwestwardly, south- 
westardly, etc. which leaves a latitude of a great many 
degrees of the compass, for fixing any certain course. 

Odd as this may seem, it is the case with a great number 
of old patents, as well as these, made out at random, in 
the infancy of this country, without any previous survey. 

I know only one way of construeing and explaining such 
patents, and which has generally been adopted: that is, 
to consider the course and distance upon the river or creek 
as a key to the rest, and first reducing the courses of 
the creek to a straight line, the distance mentioned 
from the beginning, and finding the true course of such 
reduced line, to lay off the other courses at right 
angles: if this is done in the present case, as the course 
of the creek v &rys in its orogress, the lines of these 
patents will be found to run upon and through each other; 
but as they are exoressed to bind upon one another, if 
the first was ascertained, the others might be laid down, 
as to bind uponit , and upon each other; was it not for 
their having been misplaced, in the manner already 
described; yet still they would run into elder patents, 
and would not include near all the land left clear of 
other titles, so that both you and Mr. Steptoe have your 
choice of difficultys. 

I wish you would get Mr. Hunter, or some other friend 
in your neighbourhoud skilled in surveying, to try the 
courses of these patents for you; which by the plat I sent 
you and the observations I have now made may easily be done 
and I am sure it will be found that the difficultys I have 
mentioned as not the creatures of my imagination. 

Under such complicated circumstances I considered the 
actual possession and the ancient settlements as yours and 
Mr. Steptoes sheet anchors and I thought it, and still 
think it, equally the interest both to avoid any dispute 
with other people, as with each other: and I know of no 

other way, so safe and effectual, of securing your 


52 


respective titles, as that I advised, of sueing out new 
grants upon your old patents; the entry you have made for 
waste land preventing, in the mean time, any other person 
from slicing in, and confining you to the courses and dis- 
tances of the patents you now hold the land by; tho at the 
time I advised an entry for waste land, I expected the 
quantity of land, clear of other patents, would not have 
turned out much greater than it has; not conceiving that 
Baxter's patent approached so near Pohick Creek. 

Had there been any old survey, of public notoriety, 
and the actual possession near lines corresponding, such 
antient survey might (i should think) be substituted to 
fix the bounds, in lieu of the patent; but there never 
having been any such thing, they are at present extremely 
vague and uncertain, and can't be laid off (as I have 
already observed) without running the greater part into 
elder patents. 

Impressed with these ideas, I thought it best to 
resurvey Gosnell's natent so as to interfere with nobody, 
nor leave Mr. Steptoe any cause to dispute it, or to enter 
a caveat against such resurvey; and it was therefore I 
proposed laying off Gosnell's patent so as to include your 
ancient settlement (Christmas's tenement) and the 500 acres 
at the upper end, giving it only its original distance 
upon the creek, and from thence binding with the lines of 
the adjacent lands; which was conforming more nearly to 
the original patents than any other method I could devise, 
and left for Steptoe 460 acres below, tho' it would have 
left out the pocosson, with one of your new settlements, 
where John Saxton lives, and tho' that part of the land, 
upon Normansell's line, near Pohick old church and the main 
road, is less valuable, from having been now pillaged of 
its timber, than the land lower down. Had Gosnell's 
patent been my own, I should notwithstanding the disadvan- 
tages, have preferred this method to the risque of any 
dispute . 

These were the principles upon which I formed my Judge- 
ments; yet my reasoning may be wrong; and probably you may 
suceed in laying it off otherwise: if you do, it will cer- 
tainly be more to your advantage than in the manner before 
laid down, and as you are desirous and including the 
pocosson, and all your present tenements, I have now laid 
down upon the plat another scheme, to answer that purpose; 
by beginning Gosnell's patent lower down the creek. Just 
below the extream end of the pocosson and drawing a line 
from thence for the dividing line between your land and 
Steptoe's, to strike the nearest corner of Baxter's patent, 
and from such beginning at the lower end of the pocosson, 
to run Gosnell's patent with the meanders of the creek to 
Normansell's corner, from thence (instead of binding with 
Normansell's line) to run such a course back to the lines 
of the adjacent lands, as will include 500 acres, between

the adjacent patents, the before mentioned dividing line, 
and the creek. This will leave 111 acres of waste land, 
between Gosnell’s upper line and the line of Normansell: 
and Gosnell 1 s patent v ill consequently take 111 acres of 
land more from Steptoe’s part than by the first proposition, 
leaving him only 3^9 acres. 

You will observe that this way of laying down Gosnell 1 s 
patent gives it considerably more than its original distance 
UDon the creek; but I don’t see how this can be avoided 
without leaving out either the pocosson and Saxton's tene- 
ment below, or Charles Christmas’s old settlement above, and 
if a greater quantity of waste land was left out above than 
111 acres it would throw the dividing line, between you and 
Steptoe, so much lower down Baxter’s next line, and thereby 
run thro some of Steptoe’s tenements, and occasion a dis- 
put e . 


It is also to be observed, that if you have more than 
your original distances upon the creek, Steptoe will also 
have more; if he claims under both Smith’s and Moulton’s 
patents; altho’ he has only 3^9 acres of land left: if he 

claims only under one of them, he will have more than double 
his distance as both methods (that I formerly proposed and 
this now substituted) are represented in the plat now given 
your son. You can examine them and adopt that you like 
best; if you approve either of them. 

In any event, I think you ought not to delay your du- 
plication to the county court for an order to resurvey 
Gosnell’s patent, under our Act of Assembly; that done, I 
mean Gosnell’s patent first resurveyed, you can then proceed 
to execute your warrant and entry upon the vacant land, for 
which purpose I will make an assignment of the entry to you. 
This I think much preferable to including any land in the 
survey of Gosnell's oatent, more than its original quantity 
of 500 acres . 

If in this business I can be of any further service, 
you may freely command it: there is very little further 
trouble, I believe, necessary: and if there was more, I 

should not regard it, being well convinced, that had the 
matter been reversed, and I had business to transact in your 
neighbourhood, you would most readily have done me every 
service in your power. 

Your observation, that by leaving out your old settle- 
ments, your title might be weakened, is certainly just; but 
you were mistaken in thinking the old settlements were to 
have been left out. 

I also think you are mistaken in your opinion that you 
would be entitled to 500 acres of land under the old grant , 
even if not a single acres was left for Steptoe. Gosnell’s 
patent would certainly have the preference, and take place 
of a younger patent; except barr’d by length of possession 
against it; which might not be the case between you and 


55 


Mr. Steptoe; but I do not conceive thatany priority of date 
would cary Gosnell’s patent contrary to the courses and 
distances expressed in it; unless such variation was sup- 
ported by testimony to ancient lines or corners; but the 
courses and distances would lay great part of it in Baxter* s 
elder patent. Luckily for you, Steptoe is in the same pre- 
dicament; and your resurvey will not interfere with anybody 
else . 

I have delivered your son a hogshead of Tobo. I lately 
received from your tenant, Sami. Athie. When I saw our 
kinsman George Mason last (about Christmas) and spoke to 
him on the subject of his bond to you, he told me he did 
not think he should be able to pay it before he received a 
sum of money from Mr. Daniel Brent, due to him on account 
his father-in-law, old Roan’s estate, upon a late compromise 
and settlement, for which he had taken Mr. Brent’s bond 
payable in two years: I shall therefore, when Mr. Fitzhugh 
calls here on his return from Richmond, deliver George’s 
bond to him. There is a small payment of seventy two pounds 
of crop Tobo. endorsed on it and placed to your credit in 
my books, arising from that little sum being due to George 
for the rents of the snuff mill the two years my son 
Thomson was concerned in it, upon an account between George 
and me; which, as I knew the balle. either way was trifling, 
I had neglected to settle before. 

I am with Mrs. Mason’s kindest respects and my own to 
you, your Lady, and Family, Dear Sir 

Your affectionate kinsman and obdt. servt.

Holmes devised to his daughter Mary 100 acres and to 
his son Daniel. If his children died before they came 
of age, the land was to go to his brother-in-law, John 
Hedges; the land descended to the eldest son of John 
Hedges, Robert Hedges, who sold lh February 1727 to 
Thomas Owsley,

McCarthy (Pr. Wm. Deeds A:24H) who mortgaged it the 
next year to Philip Walsh as security for a £500 loan.

The William Green patent comprised slightly more than 
half of the Belvoir estate of William Fairfax, George 
William Fairfax inherited the estate upon his father's 
death in 1757 and lived at Belvoir until 1773 when he 
went to England. Belvoir was then offered for rent. 

George William Fairfax died in 1787 and left the 
Belvoir estate to Ferdinando Fairfax, second son of 
his brother, Bryan. The mansion had been destroyed by 
fire. The property was then mortgaged; it was the 
subject to a life interest of Sarah Cary Fairfax, wife 
of George William. She died in l 8 ll and Belvoir 
became the sole property of Ferdinando Fairfax except 
for the mortgages he had placed on the property.

In 1698 Robert Alexander made a three-live lease to 
John Harper, Sr., William Harper and Elizabeth Harper 
for 200 acres, "part of a tract of 6000 ," to join 
tract formerly sold to John Pemit. John Harper was 
to pay the quit rents and two fat hens yearly, if de- 
manded. This is the first recorded lease found for 
Fairfax County. (Stafford Will Book Z:200) 


Robert Alexander sold 150 acres to John Pimmet i 
1687 . (RS 1:37) George Pimmet, son of John, so 
150 acre tract which was located on the north si 
Four Mile Run, to William Harper for 8000 pounds 
tobacco. (ll February 1707. Stafford Will Book

John Withers Harper sold the 150 acres to Thomas 
Pearson, whose sister Constantia married Nathaniel 
Chapman. (Pr. Wm. Deeds B:l) Chapman owned the tract 
in 17 ^ 1 , although there is no known record of a deed. 
The Chapman home above Four Mile Run was called Summer 
Hill. Pearson Chapman, of Charles County, Maryland, 
sold the 150 acres 23 July 1766 to his brother George, 
also of Charles County, for "love and affection and 10 
shillings." The deed recites that the property had 




60 


"belonged to Nathaniel Chapman of Charles County, 
Maryland, dec'd. His son and heir, Nathaniel, inheri- 
ted, but died without making disposition so the land 
descended to Pearson, "brother and heir of last named 
Nathaniel . " 

In 1690 Robert Alexander conveyed a half-interest in 
the Howson patent to his brother Philip. The land had 
descended to Robert because their father's will was 
unsigned. Three years later Phillip rebonveyed to 
Robert his half-interest, but reserved 500 acres in the 
southeast corner of the patent for himself. His son 
Philip (1TOU-1753) inh erited and had quarters on the 
land in 1741. 

Part of this 500 acre tract was taken for the site of 
Alexandria. John Alexander, after the death of Philip 
in 1753, became the owner of the tract and also town 
lots in Alexandria. By his will 1 May 1775, in 
Stafford County, John Alexander devised to his son 
William Thornton Alexander. The Executors of John 
Alexander laid off and sold lots next to Alexandria. 

In 1807 William Thornton Alexander sold his interest 
in the tract (and ground rents) to John Taliaferro. 

This ended the Alexander family connection with the 
500 acre tract reserved in severalty to Philip 
Alexander. (Arlington County Deeds B:5-88) 

The remaining part of the Howson patent passed from 
Robert, son of the John of the original purchase, by 
will dated 7 December 1703, to his sons Robert and 
Charles. Charles died intestate and Robert became the 
sole owner. This Robert was born 1688 and died 1735. 

He lived at the home plantation of the Alexanders, 
Caledon, but visited his Hunting Creek lands. 

In 1731 Benjamin Sebastian was employed as overseer 
and collector of rents; he lived on Alexander's Island. 
In a deposition he stated that he became a tenant to 
Alexander on promise of a lease, which he never got 
from Alexander in his life, but after his death, he 
got a lease from Gerrard Alexander, son of Robert, who 
inherited part of the land. (LRLS: 315) 

Benjamin Sebastian listed the tenants living on 
Alexander's land in 1731. They paid rents of 524 
pounds of tobacco for 100 acres and twice that for a 
double lot of 200 acres. The tenants living below Four 
Mile Creek were: Judith Ballenger, James Going, Sarah 
Young, and Sarah Amos. Above the creek the tenants 
were: Edward Chubb, Richard Middleton , William 

Boylstone, John Straughan, Adam Straughan, Edward Earpe 


61 


and Richard Wheeler. Robert Alexander received 6812 
rounds of tobacco yearly for the rent since Richard 
Middleton and William Boylstone had double lots. 

Robert Alexander in his will devised "Pearson’s Island 
where he now lives" to son John. His daughters 
Parthenia Massey and Sarah Alexander received hOO acres 
each. He left Holmes Island (302 acres) and 1125 ad- 
joining acres to his son Gerrard. The remaining 
acreage of the patent was divided between sons John, 
who took the land south of Four Mile Run, and Gerrard, 
who took the land north of Four Mile Run. 


John, the eldest son, married Susannah, daughter of 
Capt. Simon Pearson. He deeded to his son Charles two 
tracts of land devised to his wife Susannah by her 
father Simon Pearson, a moiety of a tract lying not far 
from -the falls warehouse taken up by his father Robert 
(800 acres adjacent to Rev. Scott) and all the land 
that ff I hold between Mr. Baldwin Dade (Senior) and 
tract of John Alexander’s that adjoins town of 
Alexandria.” In return Charles was to relinquish right 
to money from sale of lots in Alexandria. (Fx. Deeds 
E : 312 , 6 June 1763) 


Gerrard Alexander* son of Robert, received the land 
north of ^our Mile Run, except for the part belonging 
to Pearson Chapman, and was co-owner with his brother 
John of the famous contested strip which was the cause 
of many court suits. Gerrard Alexander in his will 
9 August 1760 (Fx. Will Book B:127) devised to his sonst

Gerard : 


”the house wherein I now live and 90 k

” 90b acres formerly leased to Robert 
Osborn with the island therein inclu-

”900 acres of the upper part of the 
tract whereon I now live.” 


A survey was made many years later to fix boundaries in 
settlement of a controversy between the Executors of 
the estate of John Parke Custis and the Alexanders. 

(RS 2:61) 


John Parke Custis purchased the plantations of Gerard 
and Robert Alexander in 1778. Custis died in 1781 and 
his Executors were unable to make the required payments. 
The land of Robert Alexander was returned and he was 
paid rent for the twelve years that Custis had been in 
possession. John W. Parke Custis remained in posses- 
sion of the 1000 acre tract of Gerard and on this tract

Arlington House was built,

in 1793 to his two sons Robert and Walter S. Alexander, 
The last named Robert died leaving two children, 

Edward H. and Ashton Albert Alexander, who sold their 
one-half interest, or U00 acres, in I 83 H to Anthony R. 
Eraser, As late as 1900 one of Walter S, Alexander's 
sons owned 100 acres west of Fort Meyers , one of the 
last remaining parts of the patent held by a descen- 
dant of the first John Alexander who had purchased the 
patent in 1669 from Robert Howson,

George Mason 19 July 1690 . George Mason devised by 
his will to his son French Mason, who applied for and 
received a NN grant 26 November 1717. The land was 
surveyed and found to contain 405 acres. 

In 17^1 French Mason deeded 100 acres on Pohick Creek 
to his daughter Leana, In his will he stated that 
daughter Leanna Talbot received her part at marriage. 
Mason’s daughter Rosanna, who married Simpson, 
received 100 acres in his 17U8 will. (Fx~ Wills A:256) 

French Mason devised 200 acres to his son, French Mason, 
who devised to his son and heir Francis Mason, Francis 
Mason leased 200 acres 13 June 1785 to Daniel McCarty, 
Jun, Francis Mason 13 February 1790 sold the 200 acres 
on the upper or northeast side of Pohick Creek known by 
name of Shop Point for £100 to French Simpson, (Fx. 
Deeds S : U62 ) 

This 200 acres, "lately in tenure and occupation of 
John Connell," had been leased 10 February 173^ by 
French Mason (i) to Thomas Monteith and Phyliss his 
wife. In 17^7 a lease for the same property was made 
to Phyliss Monteith and son James, James Monteith sold 
the remainder of the lease in 1777 to John Reardon. 

(Pr. Wm. Deeds B:457, Fx. Deeds B:331 and M:277)

George County in a 17^2 deed. (Fx. Deeds A:15)

Point. It seems reasonable to speculate that it 
might have been so named because of a trading store 
which was located in the area. George Mason II had 
close associations with a London firm which traded 
in the Chesapeake area. William Peel, a factor for 
the company and part owner, "in the year 1701 sat down 
with a Cargo of Goods and servants at the upper parts 
of Stafford County in Virginia and sold or disposed 
the same or the Greatest part thereof among the 
Inhabitants . . ." (Copeland and MacMaster, The Five

George Mason of Pohick obtained a judgment against 
Daniel McCarty in the General Court 1 November 1760. 
McCarty later brought suit, also in General Court, 
against Mason, evidently to recover part of the 
prooerty. See STOELL, JOHN.

Fairfax Harrison states that Ravensworth lay back of 
Howsing (Alexander) and Cadwallader Jones (or Jeffreys) 
tract. (Harrison, Landmarks , p. 187 ) 

Cadvallader Jones, an Indian trader and mapmaker, was 
a Lt . Col. of Stafford County under the first George 
Mason. In 1679 , two years after he acquired this 
patent, Jones commanded a fort below the falls of the 
Raooahannock River and traded with the North Carolina 
Indians. Jones overextended his credit and in 1687 
went to England with a plan to open the Indian trade 
across the mountains to the Great Lake region. 

In 1699 Cadwallader Jones mapped the upper courses of 
the Virginia rivers and had a trading post on what is 
now Jones Point. (Sprouse, Potomac Sampler and 
Harrison, Landmarks , pp . 607-612 ) 


Also in 1699 Cadwallader Jones received a Northern Neck 
grant for 500 acres on the branches of Accotink begin- 
ning at the westernmost corner tree of William 
Fitzhugh. In 17*+6 a suit was brought to eject George 
Mason from 500 acres of plantable land "of the Demise 
of Francis Slaughter." George Mason was then "an 
Infant under the age of twenty one years" and Ann 
Mason and John Mercer, his guardians, were defendants. 
This 500 acre tract may have been part of the tract of 
l4,ll4. (RS 1:14 b) No other record has been found 
for the large tract.

MATHEWS, JOHN 1567 2 July 1669 P 6:238 

This patent surrounded an earlier patent of James 
Cloughton for 500 acres on the lower side of Great 
Hunting Creek. A gum tree by a brew house, which was 
near a place called the Rock hole, was used for a cor- 
ner tree and was famous as a starting point for many 
surveys . 

The gum tree was also the beginning of a 500 acre 
tract which John Matthews by deed of gift dated l68l 
gave to his son-in-law, Evan Jones. The same year that 
he received the tract, Jones sold to Capt. Richard 
Brightwell, a Captain of the Maryland Rangers whose 
hunting quarter was located between Edwards Ferry and 
the mouth of Great Seneca Creek. No records have been 
found which link him to Virginia except that he owned 
the 500 acres. 

In 1691 Richard Brightwell sold the 500 acres to John 


Green of St. Mary’s County, Maryland. Green sold the 
land 19 April 1706 to Thomas Simmons of Westmoreland 
County for 10,000 pounds of tobacco. (Stafford Will 
Book Z : 32 5 ) 


The heirs of Thomas Simmons held the 500 acres until 
1734, when four deeds from Simmonds to John Colvill 
were recorded in Prince William County. (Pr. Wm. 

Deeds B:358, 442, 46 5 and 488 ) John and Thomas Simmonds 
sold 100 acres willed to John. Walter Williams and Ann 
his wife, daughter of Thomas, sold 100 acres, as did 
Thomas Simmonds and Isaac Simmonds. This accounts for 
400 acres of the 500 acre tract. 


On a 1762 survey the 500 acre tract is marked ’’now the 
property of Colvin and Turley.’ 1 Colvin is sometimes 
written instead Colvill, presumably a clerical error. 

At least kOO of the 500 acres belonged to the Colvill 
estate known as Clish. In 1731 John Colvill purchased 
600 acres of an adjoining Matthews patent. The 
Colvill estate of Clish was left to the Earl of 
Tankerville, who by his will of 1762 devised the land 
to his second son, Henry Astley Bennett and the heirs 
of his body, and if no heirs, to Charles his eldest 
son, with the proviso that the land could be sold if 
Charles and Henry could agree on the terms. They did, 
and 25 June 1792 Charles and Henry sold 300 acres to 
Bryan Fairfax and 100 acres to Roger West. Henry A. 
Bennett had sold the two tracts in 1789 and the second 
deeds were made to secure the title by making Charles, 
Earl of Tankerville a party to the deed. The 100 
acres sold to Roger West were described as ’’part of’ 
Matthews survey purchased by Colville from Simmons.” 
The 300 acre tract sold to Bryan Fairfax began at the 
gum tree near the brew house and included lots num- 
bered 1, 3 and b in the survey made of Clish by 
William Payne. (Fx. Deeds U:33 and T:l) 


and 4, which contained 110 acres and 


Lots numbered 3 
119 acres, were deeded in trust to John Moss 2 April 
1789 for the use of Jane Fairfax during her natural 
life. 


The major portion of the Matthew patent was sold to 
John West by John Waugh, who had purchased it from John 
Matthews. John West in his will l6 November 1716 left 
the property to his infant son John West. 

John West sold 2b July 1739 to Stephen Martin 300 acres 
located between the Cloughton patent and the N58 1/2°W 
line of the Matthew patent. (Pr. Wm. Deeds D:193)

As a result he applied for a warrant from the

1763 by John Mauzy. Twenty six years later his son, 
Roger West, received a Northern Neck Grant for three 
tracts of land and it is from the 1763 survey that the 
chain of title from Matthews to Waugh to West is 
established. (Land Office, Northern Neck Surveys No. 1

NORMANSELL, RICHARD 2550 5 June 1666 P 4:443 

Northwest side Potowmack River on the main run of 
Pohick Creek. 

Because of "differences" pending in the Stafford 
County Court, it was ordered that the Normansell Patent 
be equally divided. Richard Normansell was to have the 
land on the northeast side of the main run of Pohick 
and Martin Scarlett was to have the portion on the 
southwest side. The order for the division was dated 
10 November 1674 and was acknowledged in court the next 
day. (PLC 1:43,44) Pohick Creek was made the dividing 
line and it was not an equal division of the property. 

Martin Scarlett sold his half to George Mason 10 March 
1690 with an exception of 320 acres. Thomas Brooke 
and Sarah (Mason) his wife sold 320 acres to Robert 
Boggess 22 May 1742. Robert Boggess also had a lease 
of 100 acres from French Mason, son of George Mason, 
made 18 November 1736. (RS 1:42, 43 and 163) 

Henry Boggess, eldest son and heir of Robert, deeded 
250 acres to his sister Winifred Boggess. This was all 
the interest Henry had in moiety of land on the south 
side of Pohick above the falls. (Fx. Deeds L:43. 

18 August 1773) Winifred married John Harris and 
17 April 1777 they sold 63 acres for £63 to Alexander 
Henderson. The 63 acres were between land Alexander 
Henderson purchased from Bryan Fairfax and the main run 
of Pohick and were described as part of the 250 con- 
veyed by Henry, son of Robert who bought the land from 
Thomas Brooke and Sarah his wife, to his sister 
Winnifred Boggess. 

The remaining part of the Mason share of the patent 
was devised by French Mason in his will to his children. 
(Fx. Wills A:25 6. Proved 15 November 1748) 

Richard Normansell in his will 24 February 1683/4

devised his mare in Stafford to Joseph Summers. Half 
of his land in Stafford was devised to his sister, 
Francis Owens, and her children and the other half was 
devised to Colonel William Pearce. (PLC 1:42, 43) 

The lower half of the Normansell part was willed to 
William Pierce (Pearce) of Westmoreland County. He 
sold to Mary Clark, or Clerk. At her death the tract 
went to her three surviving daughters. One daughter, 
Francis, married John Mayfield and they sold 234 
acres to Samuel Smith of Stafford County. Samuel had 
an only son, John Smith, who sold the "middlemost” 234 
acres to Robert Boggess 15 December 1742 for £60. 

( Fx . Deeds A : 8 ) 

John Awbrey sold the lower 234 acres to Robert Boggess. 
Boggess had purchased this 234 acres from Francis 
Awbrey, brother of John, 26 February 1741. The land 
had been devised to them by their father Francis 
Awbrey; John was eldest son and heir-at-law so Boggess 
took the precaution to have a deed of release from him. 
(21 July 1743. Fx. Deeds A:65) 

John Smith of Truro Parish, possibly in an effort to 
clear the title on the land he had sold in 1742 to 
Robert Boggess and which contained more than 234 acres, 
sold 26 April 1756 for £60 (the same consideration as 
in the 1742 deed) to Robert Boggess 322 1/2 acres 
described as being the moiety half of part of 645 acres 
conveyed by deed of gift from Mary Clark to her six 
children: William, Elizabeth, Ann, Mary, Jane and 

Francis. Francis and Ann were the surviving children 
and Francis married John Mayfield, who sold to Samuel 
Smith, deceased. John, his only son, made the sale to 
Boggess. (Fx. Deeds D:258) 

The third part of the 702 acres was held by a daughter 
of Mary Clerk who married George Tomlin of Richmond 
county. The tract next became the property of Hannah 
Anne, wife of Francis Randall. Hannah Anne, surviving 
heir of George Tomlin, and Francis Randall sold to 
Daniel French 3 April 1764 and the 234 acres were then 
devised to Elizabeth, daughter and heir-at-law of 
Daniel French. She married Benjamin Dulany of

Triplett for £300. The deed included another tract of 
130 acres, part of a larger tract purchased by Robert 
Boggess of Francis Awbrey 26 February 1741 and of John 
Smith 15 December 1742 and of John Awbrey 21 July 1743. 
This 130 acres had been sold by Robert Boggess and Anne

purchased of Francis Randall and land purchased by 
Robert Boggess of John Smith, on the north side of 
Pohick. (Fx. Deeds K: 330 . 27 April 1773) 

The tract of 702 acres had been divided into three 
parts by Richard Osborn, William Godfrey and Zephaniah 
Wade by order of the Prince William Court 22 February 
17^1. The deed of partition was between Francis 
Awbrey, John Smith and George Beckham, The Beckham 
part was that sold by Francis Randall to Daniel French. 
Randall sued Robert Boggess for trespass in an effort 
to establish the boundary line. (RS 1:45) Litigation 
continued after the Randall-Bogges s suit. John Fowler 
sued Sarah Triplett in 1787 and recovered a portion of 
the land. Thomas Trinlett sued Robert Boggess early 
in the nineteenth century. Two surveys were made in 
1804 and 1806 concerning the dividing lines of the 
properties. (RS 2:120-122 and RS 2:127-128. PLC 1: 
24-60. Note: pp. 35-38 are missing.) 

Edward Sanford acquired Thomas Triplett's land, called 
Barnaby, and it was devised by his will, dated 6 June 
l 8 ll, to his three surviving children, Margaret, 

Joseph and Katherine Sanford and to the heirs of his 
deceased daughter Elizabeth Hough Sanford, formerly 
the wife of Captain Edward Washington. The executors 
divided the land into four large lots and two small 
ones. (See Russell, "Pohick Close," pp. 44-45) 

In 1767 Daniel French owned the Beckham, or Randall 
tract, and deeded three acres and 26 perches to the 
Vestry of Truro Parish for a site for the proposed new 
Pohick Church. This was a more central and convenient 
location for the church at the crossroads of the post 
road, "sometimes called the King's Highway, at the 
point where it was crossed by the Ravensworth rolling 
road to Pohick Warehouse and joined by the road to 
Posey's Ferry." (Russell, "Pohick Close," p. 39) 

The remaining half of the Normansell part of the patent 
or the northern part, was granted to Major George 
Eskridge as a Northern Neck grant for 640 acres which 
were described as escheated land and part of a tract 
granted to Richard Normansell and Martin Scarlet. It 
is shown on RS 1:8 as part of a suit Fowler v. Triplett 

James Stentoe and Elizabeth his wife, of Westmoreland 
County sold 11 Anril 1754 two tracts of land in Fairfax 
County to Richard Lee, also of Westmoreland County. 

One tract was described as the 640 acre escheat patent 
of George Eskridge. (Fx. Deeds C: 8 l 6 )

ten persons. 

The patent was granted by order of the Governor and 
Council dated 6 June 1 666 and was recorded 29 September 
1671 in Westmoreland County. 

Nicholas Spencer, for a valuable consideration, assigned 
all his right, title and interest in this patent to 
William Lambert 17 September 1671. (Westmoreland Deeds 
and Wills No. 1, 1653-1671, p* 407 ) William Lambert 
sold 100 acres, part of 500 bought of Nicholas Spencer, 
to William Beaty. The 100 acres were to begin at the 
upper end of his land adjacent to land of Gosnell and 
run down the creek the fifth part in breadth of his 
500 acres. This deed was dated 26 November 1671 and 
is also on p. 4 07 • 

William Lambert of Wes tmoreland County assigned all his 
interest in patent of Snenc er to Robert V aulx for 600 0 
lbs. tob? He executed another deed to Vaulx 
24 September 1673, for the same consideration, and men- 
tioned 500 acres. Later he gave bond of 20,000 lbs. 
tob? "to keep covenants." (Westmoreland Deeds and Wills 
No. 2, , pp. 146 , l64a-l65, and 167 ) 

James Stentoe and Elizabeth his wife of Westmoreland 
County sold two tracts of land in Fairfax County to 
Richard Lee, also of Westmoreland County. One tract 
was 500 acres granted Nicholas Spencer l6 November 
1666 on lower side of Pohick owned in right of 
Elizabeth. (Fx. Deeds C:8l6, 11 April 1754. The other 
tract was 640 acre escheat patent of George Eskridge. 

The two tracts sold for £600.)

This is the only royal patent found which was issued 
after a Northern Neck Grant was made for land in 
Fairfax County. This land was surveyed 27 April 1669 
by John Alexander and a Northern Neck grant was made 
in March 1674/5. Governor Herbert Jefferys, in 1677, 
granted the 5000 acres, described above, to Col. 
Nicholas Spencer and Lt . Col. John Washington, "said 
land being due . . . for the transportation of one 

hundred (persons?) into this colony." (MVLA microfilm.

In a court suit Daniel McCarty produced a copy of a 
patent for 1000 acres granted John Stowell 27 November 
1657. (RS 1:25B, 26) McCarty also produced an 
attested copy of a patent granted Philip Carpenter for 
the same land 1 February 1663; Carpenter's assignment 
of the land to Robert Mosely and Richard Hallett 
dated 20 June 1665 and their reassignment of the 
patent to Carpenter and his wife 13 January 1665 which 
was recorded 15 February 1666; Robert Massey's assign- 
ment to Joseoh Peirce dated 8 April 1669 and recorded 
16 February 1670 (Peirce was a merchant of Plymouth 
who did not seat the land); and a Proprietor's deed of 
grant to Thomas Owsley which was assigned to Capt. 
Daniel McCarty l4 August 1718 and recorded 10 September 
1718. The Daniel McCarty of the court suit was grand- 
son of Capt. Daniel McCarty of the 1718 deed. 

When Thomas Ousley (Owsley) took his 1000 acre grant 
15 November 1694 (NN 2:58) the land was described as 
beginning on a branch of Potomack beyond land of

Col. Sneake since Busrodes now in occupation of Capt. 
George Mason, butting southerly on branch or creek, 
easterly on north branch thereof, which said creek for-

Two surveys were made for the Mason-Mc Carty law suits. 

(RS 1:25 and 58 ) George Mason, of Gunston Hall, was 
concerned about some misplaced depositions. He wrote 
the following to James Mercer 5 February 1780: 

". . . The Depositions taken on the last survey between 

French Mason and Daniel McCarty I am apprehensive have 
not been recorded, and that the originals are lost, or 
mislaid, unless you have them (or the Office Conys ) 
among your Papers. Colo. McCarty says he perfectly 
remembers your shewing them to him in Fredericksburg a 
few years ago: I beg the Favour of you, my dear Sir, 
to examine yr. Papers carefully, and if you can find 
either the original Depositions or authentic Copys of 
them, to transmit them to me; for if they are lost (as 
most of the witnesses are now dead) I think my Son-in- 
Law, young Danl. McCarty, will lose a valuable part of 
the Estate he lives on: whereas if these Depositions 
can be found, I think he has a clear cause . . ♦ ” 

(Rutland, The Papers of George Mason , Vol. II, pp. 617-18) 


Unfortunately, the results of the law suits are not 
recorded, so it is not known which line was used for the 
boundary. The surveys, however, do show the early com- 
munity that settled along the edge of Pohick Bay. The 
Pohick Tobacco Inspection House was located on this land; 
also shown is a house labeled "The Defendant ’ s House, 
formerly the Plaintiff's where this ejectment was served 
as per the deposition of Vincent Boggess." (Daniel 
McCarty was the plaintiff.)

McCarty. (RS 1:58) On the Belvoir Neck survey there 
are two Thomas patents shown. They are labeled Benoni 
Thomas and the acreage given is 1070 and ll80. The 
ll80 is the Stoell patent, although it is labeled 
Benoni Thomas now McCarty. The 1070 acres on the north 
side of Accotink is also labeled "now McCarty" and is 
the only Thomas patent that has been located. In 
Charles Green's NN Grant F : 69 the line of McCarty, for- 
merly the land of Thomas, is mentioned. The deed or 
deeds from Thomas to McCarty have not been found.

South branch Little Hunting Creek near John Matthews. 

Matthew Thompson sold 300 acres lH March 1688/9 to 
Charles Rose; in 17^7 Sampson Darrell, defendant in a 
court suit, produced the deed of sale. He also pro- 
duced the deed for the sale of the land from Joseph 
West to his grandfather dated 20 February 1691/2, but 
did not mention when West acquired the land from Rose. 
The 300 acres were located above Sampson Darrell's NN 
grant of 200 acres which was regranted as 162 acres. 

(RS 1:19-20) 

George Washington acquired the 300 acres from Sampson 
Darrell 12 December 1757 for £260 and a £90 note which 
came due in April 1760. With a letter to Col. 
Washington, dated 9 October 1759, Darrell transmitted 
the seventeenth century deed of Mathew Thompson to 
Charles Rose, but could not find the deed transferring 
the property to his grandfather, Sampson Darrell.

Fleming, New York) 

Washington made a survey 4 and 5 November 17^2 in an 
attempt to find the boundaries and acreage of the land 
he bought from Captain Darrell, The following is a 
transcript of this survey from Washington’s original 
autogranh manuscript in the collection of John F. 

Fleming, New York: 

"Thursday Nov. 4th 17^2 

Endeavoured to find out the Courses and contents of the Land I 
bought of Cant, Darrel. First I went to hunt for the Marie 
said to be Spencers Corner on the South ^ork of little hunting 
Creek, and discovered one lying down the Run from the place 
where (on Oct the 1st 1759) I judged it to be, S°6l.30Ell 1/2- 
po this Marie has some old Marks, but not much like a Corner, 
and stands too low down the Run as I conceive to answer the 
Courses of Spencers back line and the line of Darrels little 
Patent. I Therefore went back to the Run opposite to the for- 
mer Marie and traversed the courses of the Run as high ur as I 
apprehended the Line of Darrels purchase out of Thompsons 
Patent would fall as follows - 
N°21 . 1 5¥ l4 roles 
N 21.15E 27 
N 3 3 . 4 5E 22 1/2 

N 8 . 4 5 W 18 poles to a Marie blazed, and a little Spanish 
Oak by the Side of it, supposed as before said, to stand near 
the place where the line of the purchase out of Thompsons 
Patent would come to, the Run continues for some distance 
further the course last mentioned 
viz. . N 8 . 4 5 W 

I then went back to the Marie (which I have here concluded 
to be the beginning) and run the back line of Darrels little 
Patent according to brokes plat - viz S°84 W and made it 6l8 
roles, instead of 598 at 200 poles I came to a small white 
0 *£nosimon, ye Limbs of wch I cut and bent 

down near ye middle of the Gum Swamp and below ye broad 
part of in passing my new Tob ’ o House I left it about 
5 or 6 Rod to the Right, 

The 6l8 poles brought me to Doeg Run by a midling large Maple, 
forked pretty high up. it is hollow and has a hole cut in it 
ab 1 t 3 or 4 feet from the ground - in getting to this my 
course struck the hen house at Gist’s old dwelling and passed 
thru the Lap of a fallen ? / [aple forked, which (possible) may 
have been the corner mentioned in Brookes Survey to have been 
shown for a corner of Matthew Thompson’s Patent - as also of 
Darrels little Patent - but I could perceive no traces of 
regular marks, and as well as I remember, Gist once showed me 
a Maple in his Meadow which he said was the Corner here spoken 
of, this stood at a good distance (not less than 15 poles) 
from the Run and woud have 


80 


been also some Rod to my right as I passed, was the tree 
remaining. 

From hence I went down the Meanders of the Run as 
follows .

makes to another Forked Maple said to be a Corner of Spencers 
land but I could find no Maple, standing, or even the remains 
of one. At this place however with a knife I blazed a gum 
and parcel of maples opposite to a grassy pond. The bearing 
of the Run from hence seems to be about S°24 E. 

From this place in order to find out the Situation of 
the Tob ' o H? by w'wh I had passed in run ' g Spencers Line 
(Oct 2d 1759) I extended N° 70.30 E 22 1/2 poles - and ye 
Corner of the House from hence lay N° U 1 . U 5 E 20 poles and 
the great pine bore S°12.15 E 2k poles - as near as I coud 
Judge it being almost dark 


Friday 5th November 1762 


I intended to have run the back line of Spencers Patent 
to see how it agreed with the course run by another Compass 
(Oct'r 2'd 1759) but the day was bad, and by a mistake in 
the Chain carryers going to Doegs Run instead of Hunting 
Creek I was prevented; Therefore coud make no accurate Sur: 
vey of Darrels little patent - but by what Courses I have 
run, and the giving Line it woud seem to contain about 215 
Acres. - but this course to be run at a convenient time of 
the year. not having leizure now, Just setting of for 
Williamsburg. - 

I went to the hollow Maple however up the Run; where 
by my Yesterdays course the Corn'r of Thompsons Patent and 
Darrels should be, followed the Meanders of the Run up, in 
order to find out the Situation of the purchased three 
hundred acres out of the said Thompsons patent.

Latter and crossed the Fence into the Woods 
large Spanish Oak almost Dead and a red Oak 
down yet growing. 

At 320 poles crossed a path on which I 
Oak or two Just by a small bending white Oak broken topped: 

- about 8 poles from a large white oak to the Right blown up 
by the Roots. - 

at 33^ poles came to another Path - cut down a small 
red Oak Saplin on the West side the Road and 
blazed a Sasafras on the East side standing 
close to a Red Oak. - 

at 3^0 poles came to the edge of the White Oak and 
Gum Swamp 

at 5^ poles came to an old path and found that I was 
40 yards within (that is South of) some cut 
Bushes marked at crossing this path before. - 

at 640 poles came to little hunting Creek. about 40 
yards also lower down the Run than the Maple 
blazed, and little Spanish Oak. by the side of 
it, supposed to stand where this Line would come 
t o . - 

NOW the proceedings of this day seems to demonstrate that I 
was too low down the Run for the Right Corner of Thompson 
Patent for I remember full well likewise that Gist told me 
the parrellel to give 300 acres out of Thompsons Patent 
Included the Tobacco house which the course run this day 
left out It appears also that all the long lines measured 
by my new chain hold out more than by Brookes and Jennings’s 
measurements /perhaps my Chain is too short and if so I 
shall loose by such an Error - Note the Chain to be tryed 

Whenever this 300 acres comes to be laid of, have the 
place where the Forked Maple (said in the Deposition of 
Nich’s Carroll according to Brooke's Survey) stood, be well 
ascertained, as the certainty of having equitable Justice 
done both to me, and the present possessor of Matthess’s 
Patent depends upon this - in the Subsequent dispute as 
appears I think by Jennings’s Survey - Mr. Lewis Wm. Brummit 
Elias Gist James Halley Rob. Steffins and Bryant Allison 
seems to be the person (s ?1 who shewed the place where this 
Hollow or Forked Maple stood. 


In addition to the 300 acres Darrell tract, George 
Washington purchased a part of the Thompson patent from 
George Mason. A deed dated 2k October 1769 was listed 
in the Henkel’s Sale Catalogue No. 663 in 1891. 
(Rutland, Mason , vol. 1, p. Il4) Washington paid Mason 
in April 176 9 for 100 acres of land out of Thompson’s 
patent adjoining the land he bought from Sampson 


82 


Darrell. (George Washington 1 s Account Book, Ledger A, 

P. 6l) A deed George Mason to George Washington is 
indexed as being in Fairfax Deed Book H:297. This deed 
book is missing. The deed. Mason to Washington, was 
registered in the Fairfax County Court order book for 
1768-1770, p. 256, 22 November 3 . 769 . 

Although Washington was concerned about the title. 

Mason wrote that he believed "the land contained in 
Thompson’s patent to be as safe as any tract of land in 
the country." He also stated that he had all the 
original papers relative to it which he would be glad 
to have Washington examine. (Rutland, Mason , vol. 1, 
p. llh) 

In 1689 Matthew Thompson sold 200 acres of this patent 
to Ambrose Bailey. Bailey held the land until 
15 January 1693M when he sold to Robert Brent of 
Stafford County. Brent had one son and four daughters; 
Elizabeth, the sole surviving heir, married Jesse 
Doyne and had two sons. Robert Doyne of Charles County, 
Maryland, was heir-at-law and sold the 200 acres to 
George Mason. The 200 acres had not been separated from 
the original patent; Mason had paid quit rents on the 
200 acres in addition to his own property. Mason pur- 
chased the 200 acres for £^5 from Robert Doyne 2h May 
1757. (Fx. Deeds D:467) 

Mason then had the remaining part, or approximately 
l6h8 acres, of the Thompson patent regranted as NN I : U 3 
which was dated 21 July 1657* Thomson Mason received 
this property by the will of George Mason of Gunston 
Hall.'

Baxter sold to Cocke in 173^; the deed could be a 
strengthening of the title. (Pr. Wm . Deeds B:^51*

EARL OF TANKERVILLE U7 3r 19p 19 January 1776 NN 1:270 

Great Hunting Creek beginning at a gum tree corner to 
Matthews and afterwards in possession of Col. John 
Colvill . 


John Colvill devised various tracts of land to his 
brother, Thomas, and gave him life interest in Colvill's 
plantation called Clish. Thomas Colvill wrote to 
Col. Thomas Bryan Martin, Agent for the Proprietor, when 
he found that a survey had been made of waste and marsh 
land along the Potomac River adjacent to Clish. The 
survey was made by John Hough 17 October 176H "Pursuant 
to a warrant to me directed for John Patterson; 

(Objected to by Col. Thomas Colvill as a warrant Fraude- 
lently obtained) but at the request and direction of 
said Thomas Colvill as well as of John Patterson ..." 


The letter to Martin was dated October 28, 176U, Clish, 
Fairfax County. ,f Sir: Some time since John Houghs son 
came here to survey a piece of land and marsh joyning 
to this tract of my Brothers on which I live, but after 
my decease left to Lord Tankerville. The Warrant was 
in the sole name of John Patterson, without the least 
mention either of his Lord or me who am the present pos- 
sessour. As it is marsh and land oeverflowed at high 
tides, I ought to have had notice; but this would not 
have serv'd Pattersons turn, whose intention was to ob- 
tain a deed by surprize; I intended to have enter'd the 
land and marsh as soon as I was inform'd it was not 
included within my lines, and apply 'd to John West 
junr. to have enter'd for me, who I find has neglected 
it. I must own that I was exceedingly surpriz'd (when 
I saw the Warrant) at Pattersons infidelity to his 
employer; the tract adjoyning this land and marsh con- 
tains hOO acres on which the plantation is settled, and 
is so circumstanc 1 d that wanting the pasturage and hay 
made on the marshes, it would not possibly subsist, 
setting aside, being cut off from the conveniency of 
the creek itself; so that if Patterson had got a deed, 
he needed not have valued his Land, for whoever has the 
marshes can force the owner of the tract to buy or sell 
on his own terms. 

M I wrote you before you went to W^ s burg by DoctT Green 
sumthing to the above purpose, and now repeat it lest 
it may have slipt your memory - and after this, which 
is a true state of the case, I hone you will think it 
just to grant an entry for about fifty acres of land and 
marsh joyning to my land on Hunting Creek, and if you 
have no objection, direct a Warrant to John West jun. 
to survey the same, (or any other surveyor you please)

and the deed to be made out in my name to

Thomas Colvill wrote to Martin in February 1765 st 
that a deed to Lord Tankerville alone would not su 
for "his agent may pretend that such a deed may be 
supersedas to my present right, and so maliciously 
some rascal of his upon it to give me disturbance, 
you see the necessity I am under to preserve my po 
sion of it as long as I live, for I do nob mean to

In a third letter to Martin, Colvill wrote that if he 
could be secured in the possession as long as he lived 
he would be content, "but I must have it made sure, as 
not caring to subject myself to the will of the great 
man of his Agent, but to be absolutely out of their 
power . " 

Thomas Colvil’s will was admitted to record 6 January 
1767 . The tract of waste and marsh land was granted to 
Charles Bennet , Earl of Tankerville in 1776.

and three black tithables. Also listed is William 
Berkley, Jr., with one tithable and Burgess Berkley also 
with one tithable. William Berkley's will (Fairfax Wills

Samuel and Rueben. A William Berkley was not on any 
surviving voting list of Fairfax County 17^-1768 , but 
John, Samuel and Benjamin voted between 1755 and 1765 . 

William Berkley was the Plaintiff in at least three law

John Waugh 10 February 1730 and the Defendant, Paul 
Turley, had a lease from John Waugh for 200 acres dated 

17 October 1733* They could not agree on their dividing 
line. After ten years of contention the case was taken 
before the General Court and the outcome is not recorded. 
(A jury decided for Paul Turley after the second case 
(Fairfax Court Order Books, 17^9-175^, t> . 215) and 
Turley eventually purchased the property. Fx. Deeds

John Hartshorn received a Northern Neck grant

tract corresponded to the original Brechin patent and 
one tract was the exact bounds of land which later was 
granted to John Wilkinson. (NN W:605. 26 October 1795)

George Johnston was a member of the Virginia Assembly 
(1758-1766) and vas legal advisor to George Washington. 
The house Belvale, 7101 Telegraph Road, was probably 
built between 1763 and 1766, the year of Johnston’s 
death. The house remained in the Johnston family until 
1925. (See HABS - Belvale) (it is recited in Fx. Deeds

Part of this tract was in Prince William County. The

that line evidently interfered with the Britt grant for 
940 acres. Since the Britt grant was the elder grant, 
the Landon Carter grant lost acreage. The land was sur- 
veyed in 1803 for the heirs of John F. Carter. This 
survey shows another variation of lines, and calls for a 
South 88 West 398 poles line where the original survey 
called for North 43 East 555 (reversing it would give 
South h3 West 555). RS 2:117.

Carter's 8ll+l acre grant was resurveyed by John Hough 
and found to contain surplus land. The greater tract, 
which included four grants totaling 6190 acres owned by 
other persons, contained 21,037 acres. The surplus land 
of 6706 acres was added to the 8lUl acre grant and a new 
grant was issued. Approximately 6k 5k acres of this grant 
are in Fairfax County. 

172 CARTER, ROBERT JR. 

CARTER, CHARLES 762 Ik October 1728 NN B:lU5 LS 

Horsepen Run and Broad Run above Potomac Falls. 

Robert Carter, a man of tremendous energy and shrewd 
business habits, was agent for the Northern Neck 
Proprietary during two periods: 1702-1712 and from 1722 
until his death in 1732. When he died, age 69 , his 
obituary stated that he left 300,000 acres of land, 

1,000 slaves and £10,000 in money. (Harrison, Landmarks , 
p. 197) 

In 1707 Robert Carter began acquiring land above the 
falls of the Occoquan. This land was granted in the 
name of his son, Robert Carter, Jr., who was then three 
years old. During a span of 2k years Robert Carter, Jr. 
received grants for 26, 63^ acres in Fairfax County. 

Landon Carter and others received ^,3^8 acres. One 500 
acre grant near the Potomac may not have been valid, as 
no other record has been found for it and a 227 acre 
grant was included in another Carter grant. 

Until the nineteenth century about 10 percent of Fairfax 
County belonged to members of the Carter family. The 
total of 30,255 acres granted to the Carters is based on 
the approximate number of acres of the grants actually 
in Fairfax County. The acreage is considerably higher 
if you use the number of acres given on the grants. How- 
ever, the higher figure, or 83,050 acres, includes land 
in Loudoun and Prince William counties. 


lU3 


The lands of one of the Carter heirs, Robert Carter of 
Nomini Hall, we re divided and Benjamin Dawson, who was 
an agent for Carter, made a copy 13 December 1815 of 
the valuation and division of a total of 34,692 acres. 
The tracts were in Northumberland, Richmond, Westmore- 
land, Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun and Frederick 
counties . 

The Fairfax County lands were valued and allotted as 
Darts of tracts 4, 6 , 7, and 8 . Sophia Carter received 
the Sandy Run tract of 2412 acres which was valued at 
$5.75 per acre or $13,869. Sarah Fairfax Chinn re- 
ceived the 10 acres at Occoquan landing valued at $105 
and 2860 acres of the Bull Run tract, including Leo 
Plantation, valued at $31,1+60. George Carter received 
a Difficult Run tract of 330 acres valued at $ 1 , 980 . 
(This tract was purchased from John Savage in 1733.) 

John Tasker Carter received the Wolf Run tract of 902 
acres and the Scotts Pun tract of 800 acres which were 
valued at $ 8 , 961 . (ViHMss lC2465al0) This division 
accounts for about 7,000 acres of the Carter grants. 

A Carter land book listed other tracts which were 
"thought to belong to a company styled the Frying Pan 
Comnany," of which tracts Robert Carter of Westmoreland 
County claimed one fourth part. (The distribution of 
the Carter lands is documented in the volume entitled 
Carter of Shirley v. Carter , which covers the case in 
chancery as conducted in the Fredericksburg District 
Court . ) 

The lands listed as Dart of the Frying Pan Comnany in- 
cluded the Broad and Sugarland Run, Piney Ridge, 875’ 
and 217 acres on Ox Road, 3500 acres on Occoquan 
River (sold to John Semnle and lost by prior title), 

762 acres on Horsepen and 436 acres bought of William 
Berkley but M not to be found.” A total of approximately 
15,577 acres were included in the Frying Pan lands. 

Quarters were established on the Frying Pan tract before 
1732; Green’s list of tithables shows two Carter 
O.uarters in 1749. In later years plantations were 
established on the Bull Run tract. 

About 45 leases for three lives have been found which 
were made between 1751 and 1777 on Carter land in 
Fairfax County. A Carter land book listed 38 leases on 
the Broad Run and Sugarland tract and it is assumed that 
half were in Fairfax County. Fifteen persons claimed 
leases on the Piney Ridge tract and on the Bull Run 
tract of 6030 acres four leases are recorded in Fairfax 


Deed books. Seven leases were made on the Scotts Run 
tract. This accounts for approximately 7100 acres, or 
just over one fourth of the Robert Carter, Jr. land. 
(Records are very sketchy for the Carter leases. The 
land book from the Virginia Historical Society Library 
is valuable and is the only record found for Carter 
leases in Fairfax County except for the four leases 
found in the deed books. ViHMss lC2465a8)

Catesby Cocke was clerk of Stafford, Prince William, and 
Fairfax counties. Fairfax Harrison called him an 
''energetic speculator in Northern Neck land, principally 
in the region above Goose Creek. H (Harrison, Landmarks ,

Cocke’s grants in Fairfax County were mainly tracts sur- 
veyed for other persons and taken up by Cocke when the 
composition fees were not paid. Two of the grants (88 
and 860 ) were on Brent land and were probably never 
valid grants. Cocke had the seven grants made in 1731, 
just before the death of Carter, re-granted in 1739* His 
reason for doing this is not known. 


Cocke received a total of 2581 acres, 9^8 of which were

Francis Cofer was ordered by the Truro Parish Vestry to

Ravensworth, nositioned in the south central section,

sold to said William Fitzhugh by deed dated 22 August 
1685 and acknowledged in Stafford Court the 19th 
September next following." 

Born in England in 1651, William Ftizhugh arrived in 
Virginia in 1670 or 1671 . The first record of his 
presence that has been located is a power of attorney 
dated 25 October l673/4. ( UO V 187-204) He was a 

lawyer. Commander of the Stafford Militia, a member of 
the Stafford Court, and served as agent for the 
Proprietors. It has long been thought that his home 
plantation was Bedford, now in King George County, but 
Mr. George H. S. King has suggested the possibility that 
his home plantation was farther U p the Potomac at Eagle’s 
Nest, which became the plantation of his eldest son, 
William. ( William Fitzhugh and His Chesapeake World , 

P . 17611 ) 


At the time of his death in 1701 William Fitzhugh owned 
some 54,000 acres. This was not the total of all his 
acquisitions , but the end result of buying and selling 
of tracts plus his patents and grants. Of the total, 
22,498 acres were located in Fairfax County. The 
larger tract of 21, 996 acres was to be equally divided 
between his sons William and Henry. His son George was 
to receive the 500 acre tract. 


Fitzhugh had detailed plans for his great tract. In a 
letter to Nicholas Hayward dated May 20th 1686 he wrote: 

" . . . And for the french Protestants, I have convenient 

and good Land enough, to seat 150 or 200 familys, upqn 
one Dividend, wch. contains 21966 Acres, which I will 
either sell them in fee, at £7 sterling for every hun- 
dred acres, or else lease it to them for three lives, 
paying 20 sh: per annum for every hundred Acres, and 
they may have the liberty, of renewing one two or three 
lives at any time, paying for each life to be renewed, 
one years Rent, without demanding any fine or other 
Consideration for their first purchase, and will engage 
to fine them with Corn and meat for the first year, meat 

at 12/6 per hundred and corn at 2/6 per bushel for as 

many soever as comes in, if it be three or four hundred 
people and all other necessarys for their money at the 

Country market price. The Land I offer to sell or 

lease is scituate in this County, lyes within a mile and 
half of Potomack River, and of two bold navigable creeks, 
is principal good Land, and is more proper for french 
men, because more naturally inclined to Vines than yours 
or any about our Neighbourhood, and will engage to 
naturalize every Soul of them at £3 sterling per head.

acceptable or pleasing to the frenchmen, or any other of

tenementing my Land, which till so done, is rather a 
charge than profit . . ." ( William Fitzhu gh and His 

Chesapeake World , p. 189) 


Unfortunately, records concerning William Fitzhugh of 
Bedford and early leases on the Ravensworth property have 
not been found. No leases were found in the Prince 
William Deed books which have been preserved. The first 
recorded Ravensworth lease in the Fairfax County records 
is 10 April 1750 when Henry Fitzhugh, of Stafford 
County, made a three live lease to Ann Moxley for 150 
acres. Thirty five leases were made during the period 
1750-1773 for a total of 4594 acres. Three deed books 
from this period are missing, so the list is not 
complete . 


Ten leases were made 1750-1758 by Henry Fitzhugh and 
eight leases were made 1766-1773, also by a Henry 
Fitzhugh. William Fitzhugh, Jr., made seventeen leases 
during the period 1767-1773, two of which were for land 
previously leased, for a total acreage of 2347 acres. 


In 1749 Rev. Charles Green listed the following as 
tithables in Truro Parish, Fairfax County. This was 
"Old Fairfax County" which extended to the mountains; 
however, only John Fitzhugh had a tract in Loudoun 
County. It is probable, therefore, that these listings 
were in what is now Fairfax County: 

Quarter with 2 white 
19 black tithables. 

Quarter with 3 white 

18 black tithables. 

Quarter with 1 white 

19 black tithables. 

Quarter with 2 white 
27 black tithables. 

Sometime between 1701 and 1714 the Ravensworth tract was 
divided following the approximate route of Braddock road. 
Henry Fitzhugh took the northern part and William, who 
died in 17l4, took the southern part. There is no 
survey record of this division.

Alexandria in 1796 and supervised th_e building of the 
Louse known as tie Ravensworth mansion on the portion of 
the estate south, of Braddock Road. (See HABS Inventory 
No. 119) William, of CLatLam and Ravensworth, devised 
800 acres to his daughter Ann Randolph Craik and the 
residue to his infant son William Henry Fitzhugh. (Will 
of 3 September 1805 . Fx. Wills J:244) William Henry 
died at the age of thirty-eight and devised the main 
part of his Ravensworth estate to his wife Anna Maria 
Fitzhugh for her life and in remainder to his niece 
Mary Ann Randolph Custis who married Robert E. Lee. 

(Fx. Wills Q:57, 243) Anna Maria Fitzhugh survived 
Mary Ann Randolph Lee by less than a year. The estate, 
then comprising over 8,000 acres became the property of 
Mrs. Lee’s sons and daughters and was divided into five 
lots. (Fx. Deeds R4:453-464) 


Henry, son of the emigrant William, married Susanna 
Cooke and their son, Major Henry Fitzhugh, married Sarah 
Battaille. Major Henry’s will was proved in King George 
County 5 June 1783. He devised his lands in Fairfax 
County called "Ravensworth" to his sons, Nicholas, 
Richard, Mordecai, Battaille and Giles. A division of 
the land is recorded in Fairfax Deed Book A2:l86. 

Major Henry left a life estate to his wife and a 
remainder to his children as joint tenants. In 1791 the 
tract was regranted for 24,112 acres. (NN V:28G) 


The title notes of Courtland Davis for the Ravensworth 
tract, with footnotes by Mrs. John Alexander, are repro- 
duced in the Historical Society of Fairfax County 
Yearbook , vol. 3, 1954. For many years Mr. Davis has 
been considered the outstanding authority on land titles

In Thomas Fairfax v. Morris Fox , Fairfax charged that 
Fox took 10 0 0 oaks valued at $2*QQQ and 1000 hicories 
valued at $2000 and other timber valued at $2000 from 
the property of Thomas Fairfax and did great damage 
"to the plaintiff and against the peace and dignity of 
the Commonwealth. " 

The Surveyor of Fairfax County was ordered to examine 
deeds and make "five fair platts" for the court. Fox 
produced his grant from James Munroe, Governor of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia. 

In the suit it is recorded that John Warner, by direc- 
tion of Fairfax, surveyed 8 June 1739 a tract on the 
branches of Difficult which said tract was afterwards 
conveyed to Fairfax by deeds of lease and release from 
the Rev. Mr. Charles Green and Margaret his wife, as may 
appear in the records of the court of the County of 
Fairfax, but Charles Green having never obtained a title 
for the said land, could not legally convey, so Fairfax 
deeded to Bryan Fairfax. 

A jury 27 October 1813 found for Fairfax who requested 
that it be certified that in the trial of this cause the 
title and bounds of land were brought in question. 

Fox’s land is called a "supposed vacancy."

In November 1768 the Vestry of Truro Parish "ordered that 
James Grimesly and William Burgess be discharged from 
paying Levy in this parish for the future." In 1782 the 
Churchwardens were to look for proper persons to whom 
may be bound the grand Children of James Grimsley. 

The Churchwardens, in February 1784, were ordered to 
allow "for their support during the present distressful 
year so much Tobacco as they or each of them nay stand 
in need of not exceeding the sum to their respective 
names annexed . . ." James Grimsley, one of the list of 

fourteen, is allowed 800 pounds of tobacco. Temporary 
support was authorized because of the uncommon severity 
of the winter and the scarcity of corn that year.

ried their cousins Henry and Ludwell Lee. A survey was 
made and recorded of the division of the l46 acre tract 
and the 232 acres of the larger 2862 acre grant. (Fx.

l46 acre grant were awarded to Ludwell Lee.

£50 to Henry Lee their 171 acres which were described as 
"beginning at the little falls warehouse landing, the 
second boundary of a tract sold by Henry Lee and Matilda 
his wife and Ludwell Lee and Flora his wife to Philip 
Richard Fendall and Lewis Hipkins." A deed dated the 
same day shows that Henry Lee sold the 171 acres for 
£950 to Philip Richard Fendall. Thomas Lee had hoped 
to found a commercial center on his land and the Falls 
Warehouse had been established there in 174-2. 

2. To his second son Thomas Ludwell Lee (1730-1778), who 


203

1786) 

3. To his fourth son, Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734-1797) 

800 acres, part of the 448l grant on Difficult Run. 

Thomas Lee specified that the 800 acres were to be the 
choice of Francis Lightfoot Lee, but that he should 
choose it on "any one side of the Land, and not in the 
middle, my design being to give him a convenient Place 
to live on with a good Spring and high Ground ..." 

Francis Lightfoot Lee lived on this land; he married 
Rebecca Tayloe in 1769 and moved to Richmond. He and his 
wife died 1797.

George Mason worded the deed for this grant very carefully 
because the courses were continually subject to changes-- 
"the Water Land and Marsh alternately gaining upon each 
other." He bound the deed upon the land and river as a 
certain way of fixing the bounds. The description of the 
bounds mentions ". . . to a point and Sand Beach on the 
upper side of the said Marsh upon Potomack River side 
nearly opposite the said Causeway Point and upon the Land 
formerly granted to Simon Connel thence across a large Bay 
of Water to the Beginning at the said Causeway Point."

John Herryford sold 300 acres to the Churchwardens and 
Vestrymen of Truro Parish for 12,000 pounds Tob? beginning 
in line Maj . Dennis McCarty’s land formerly belonging to 
Mr. Benony Thomas. (Pr. Wm. Deeds B:37l) 

John Heryford, son of James, sold **20 acres to Charles 
Green 13 July 17*+2 (in Prince William records) and 
Charles Green sold 90 acres, part of **20 moiety of James 
Heryford' s 22kk acres, to Edward Violet. (Fx. Deeds

The Churchwardens and Vestry sold the Glebe to Mr. 

William Ramsay for £50. William Ramsay sold the 300 
acres to William Fairfax and George William Fairfax 
17 July 1752. (Fx. Deeds C:350) 

The land acquisitions of George Mason II (1660-1716) 
formed the basis of the Gunston Hall estate of George 
Mason IV. Robert Moxham, in The Colonial Plantations of 
George Mason , discusses the location of the early manors 
and gives detailed information about the early patents 
from which the chain of title is derived for the Gunston 
Hall estate. 

No royal patent was issued to a Mason in Fairfax County. 
The earliest Northern Neck grant was made ** January 
171**/5 to Col. George Mason II and James Herryford. The 
grant was for 22**U acres; the portion belonging to Mason 
is not specified nor is it given in later deeds. 

George Mason II in his will devised all the land he held 
in partnership with James Hereford, "being nine hundred 
and nine acres by computation," to be divided equally 
between his two daughters Elizabeth and Simpher Rosa. 
(Rowland, vol. 1, p. 37*0 Elizabeth Mason died under 
legal age and her half descended to her eldest brother, 
George Mason. George Mason of Gunston estimated the 


210 


land to be about 1400 acres M clear of James Herriford’s 
part and of older patents.” He included 770 acres in 
his estimate of the lands which he devised to his son 
Thomson. A division was made between George Mason and 
the heirs of Simpher Rosa after a survey in 1791. The 
heirs of Simpher Rosa sold to Richard Chichester 544 
acres in two parts: 509 acres and 34 acres. Simpher 
Rosa devised to her son John who, in his will, directed 
the land to be sold and divided between two daughters, 
Margaret and Mary. Richard Bealle married the eldest 
daughter Mary and Robert Herryford married the second 
daughter. (Fx. Deeds U:382) 


George Mason III also received a Northern Neck grant in 
1715. His was for 1930 acres on the main run of 
Accotink. Ten years later he received two more grants 
totaling 652 1/2 acres, giving him a total of 2582 1/2 
acres by Northern Neck grants. 

It was George Mason IV, of Gunston Hall, who received 
eight grants in Fairfax County for a total of 3843 1/2 
acres. Of this total, 218 acres were a regrant of a 250 
acre grant made to his father, 587 1/2 acres represented 
new, or ungranted land, and 3038 acres were tracts which 
had been previously granted to other persons and pur- 
chased by Mason. 

George Mason of Gunston Hall spent considerable time and 
energy perfecting the titles to his properties. Despite 
his best efforts, he was not willing to give a general 
warranty for the land sold to George Washington out of 
Thompson’s patent and cited as reasons "The Destruction 
of Records, the Loss of Papers, and the Negligence of 
the Hands thro’ which in process of Times the Lands may 
pass." (Rutland, The Papers of George Mason , vol . 1, 

p. 11U) 


George Mason, as a Justice of the Court, was involved in 
and gave many decisions in land cases. He gave advice 
to William Fitzhugh about laying out an ancient patent 
and was concerned with his son-in-law’s suit against 
French Mason. (See the Peter Smith grant, the John 
Gosnell patent and the John Stoell patent.)

addition to the Mason estate. George Mason IV was nine 
years old at the time of his father's death in 1735 and 
there were no Mason leases recorded for land in Fairfax 
County until he was of age. 

In 1752 George Mason IV made his first lease. During the 
next twenty-five years, eighteen leases were recorded and 
this is probably not a complete list, since one of the 
deed books of Fairfax County (1763-176H) is missing. Most 
of the leases made were for 100 acres and one tract was 
covered by three leases. Fifteen leases were made in a 
ten year period beginning in 1752; the total yearly income 
after all leases were made, was 10,180 pounds of Tob? 

One lease, in 1776, was made to his son George Mason V for 
1000 acres on Dogues Neck which included two quarters. 

The token annual rent specified was "one peppercorn." 

Although not probated until 16 October 1792, George 
Mason's will was dated 20 March 1773. It lists 12,900 
acres in Fairfax County and it is interesting to note that 
George Mason was on the rent rolls of Fairfax County in 
1770 and 1772 for 12,622 acres. In 177^ he was listed 
with 13,150 acres. 

The will reflected Mason's meticulous planning and atten- 
tion to detail and gave a thorough accounting of the 
Mason land holdings. The Fairfax County land was devised 
to three sons: George, Thomson and John. An abstract of 
the division shows several tracts that have not been iden- 
tified, but the majority have been located and deeds have 
been found for most of the purchased land. 

George Mason V received Gunston Hall and 5,000 to 6,000 
adjacent acres. In general, he received all the lands 
between Potomac River, Occoquan River and Pohick Creek. 
Also devised to George V was a small tract purchased by 
George Mason III from Giles and Benoni Tillet. Except 
for a Northern Neck grant of 265 acres, this bequest re- 
presents land purchased by three generations of Masons. 

Thomson Mason received the following tracts: 

1300 acres in Thompson's patent, regranted in Mason's 
name . 

300 acres in Thomas Stafford's grant on both sides 
of North branch of Little Hunting Creek. 

152 acres in Thomas Sandiford's grant, regranted in 
Mason ' s name . 

150 acres of George Brent's sale to William Bourne. 
120 acres, part of Ball grant bought of Sampson 
Darrell . 

770 acres (approximately) in Mason-Herryford grant

"being one moiety of land" devised by Mason II 
to daughters Elizabeth and Rosanna, 

106 acres granted William Williams and purchased 
from Winifred Ball, daughter and heir-at-law 
to Williams, it "being land whereon Edward 
Violet lived. " 

402 1/2 acres granted Mason III on Dogues Run adjacent 
Mathew f s grant. 


In general, Thomson Mason received all lands on Dogue Run 
and Little Hunting Creek, about 3,300 acres.

1930 acres between main South Run of Accotink and 
branches of Difficult. 

91 acres adjacent to 1930 acre tract. 

(in general, about 2000 acres.) 


George Mason IV devised approximately 12,900 acres in 
Fairfax County; 5500 acres to George, 3300 to Thomson, 
and 1+100 to John. Part of the disposition of the pro- 
perty took place during the twenty year period between the 
date of the will and Mason’s death in 1792. Mason added 
to his real estate holdings after writing his will, but 
the will was never amended. His executors distributed the 
additional land without a surviving record. (Rutland, 

Vol . 1, p. l6l) 


George Mason V survived only four years after his father 
and by his will devised to his son George VI the eastern 
half of the Mason Neck plantations. His son William re- 
ceived the western half of the property. 


From about 1834-1866 the Mason holdings were sold out of 
the family in fairly large tracts. The last Mason to 
occupy Gunston Hall was Eleanor A. C. Patton Mason, 
widow of George VI. The Gunston Hall tract was sold at 
a public auction 9 February 1842, In 1912 Louis Hertle 
acquired Gunston Hall and restored it to its l8th century

Matthew's 2466 patent which was surveyed by Sam. 
Wise in 1672. This tract became part of the plan- 
tation called Clish. It interfered with the elder 
Mathew patent and lost 245 acres. (RS 1, last 
page ) 

John Mathews died intestate; his land descended to his 
two daughters, Mary and Ann. The following two deeds 
were made by his granddaughters: 

4 January 1723 Mott Doniphan and Rosannah his wife 

sold 903 acres to Daniel French for 10,000 pounds 
Tob? (Stafford County Deeds 1722-1728: 115) 

12 April 1709 Bryant Folio and Mary his wife sold 833 
acres to George Mason for 5000 pounds Tob? and 
20/ Sterling. (Stafford Will Book Z:46l) 

This accounts for first deeds of sale on 3036 acres, but 
this is not unusual. Many patents and grants were found 
to contain surplus ground. 

By 1723 George Mason owned 1333 acres of the grant. 

Sarah Brooke of Charles County, Maryland, sold 13 March 
1750 to John Pagan for £75 current money of Virginia 575

leases on 1555 acres, or nearly one fourth of his land

Rocky Run from below "where Richard Omohundra lived unto 
the land I bought of James Thomas and Henry Neatherton 
and along their line to great rocky Cedar run and down 
the said Great rocky Cedar run to land I leased to George 
Haden." This included much of the 1719 acre grant along 
the Mountain Road. Newgate tavern was built on the part 
of this acreage which John Newton sold to William Carr 
Lane in 1761. (Loudoun County Deeds C:329. 23 May 176l)

husband William Jett 500 acres on Big Rocky Run near the 
present site of Centreville. (Westmoreland County Deed

The records of Fairfax County include many depositions 
made by John Summers (Sommers, Symmers ) in land disputes 
which were decided by the court. He told the court that 
in old times he used to be a good deal with the surveyors 
and attended many surveys in the neighborhood of Hunting 
Creek. When he was ninety eight he was still giving de- 
positions. (Pr. Wm. Record of Land Causes, p. U 1 5 ) 

When he was ninety two he told how he moved from Dogue 
Neck to a spot near the present Christ Church in 1715- 
In 1723 John Summers moved to the ’'forest" near present- 
day Bailey’s Crossroads and in 1773 he moved further 
into the "forest" to his son's house. Summers died in 
1790, aged 102, and is buried at the corner of Beauregard 
and Barnum off Route 236.

houses were the only houses on one hundred acres of land 
which was later part of Alexandria.

1734. He was ordered to procession the lands between 
Difficult run and Broad run in 1743. The Churchwardens 
were ordered to pay John Trammel the sum of fifty shil- 
lings sterling for two acres of land at the upper church 
and the clerk was to procure deeds for the said "Trammel 
to Convey the same to the parish." This deed was re- 
corded 20 March 1746. (Fx. Deeds B:249) Falls Church is

George Turberville of Hickory Hill, Westmoreland County, 
received a total of 85^4 acres by four Northern Neck 
Grants in Fairfax County. One grant, for 800 acres, was 
in Clifton's Neck, but a note added to the grant stated 
that the land was formerly granted to Giles Brent. No 
other record for the 800 acres has been found and it is 
assumed that the grant was not valid. The three other 
grants, of 77^ acres, were in the northern part of the 
county . 


268 


In a codicil to his will dated 30 March 174l George 
Turherville devised his 4l42 acre grant to his unborn 
child, if a hoy. (Westmoreland County Will Book No. 9, 
p. 200. Will probated 30 March 1742) The child born 
was George Turherville of Pecatone, who devised in his 
will 29 June 1790 to his son George Richard Lee 
Turherville. (Westmoreland County Will Book No. 18, 
p. 278) 

A divison of the 4l42 acre tract between George Lee 
Turherville and Cornelia Lee Stuart, children of 
George R. L. Turherville, was made in a court proceeding. 
May Court 1817, Fairfax County. (Fx. Deeds S2:330) A 
portion of the original grant was lost because it inter- 
fered with an earlier Awbrey grant. Also, part of the 
grant had been sold in the twenty year period prior to 
the division. George R. L. Turherville sold 100 acres to 
Samuel Hutchison 22 November 1798. (Fx. Deeds B2:13) 
Thomas Lee, Sr., guardian of the infant children, heirs 
of George R. L. Turherville, sold 150 acres to William 
Lane, Sr. 4 April 1805. (Fx. Deeds E2:466) 

There remained of the original grant 3215 acres which 
were divided into three lots: No. 1 for 1244 acres south 
of Little River Turnpike and No. 3 for 382 1/2 acres 
north of Little River Turnpike were assigned to George L. 
Turherville, and No. 2 for 1588 1/2 acres north of Little 
River Turnpike was assigned to Cornelia Lee, wife of 
Charles Calvert Stuart . 

For further information on this tract of land, see 
W. Lewis Leigh, "Leeton,” Historical Society of Fairfax 
County, Virginia, Yearbook , vol. 6, pp . H U — h 5 . 

The 3402 acre tract of George Turherville was called 
Woodberry and a part of it was used as a settlement for 
420 acres in Westmoreland County. (Fx. Deeds U:84) 

Henry Ashton had settled the 420 acres on his daughter 
Frances who married George Turherville. George received 
the deed 19 October 1718. Then 28 May 1728 George 
Turberville settled 1000 acres, in lieu of 420, on 
Elizabeth Turberville, daughter and only surviving issue 
of Frances Turberville. This deed was confirmed by an 
Act of Assembly in 1730 and the royal assent was received 
1 November 1733. (Hening IV : 307 ) Elizabeth Turberville 
departed life without issue and Grace Lee "became en- 
titled to one half as co-heiress of said Frances 
Turberville, dec'd. and her daughter Elizabeth 
Turberville, dec'd." Grace Lee of William and Mary 
Parish, Charles County, Maryland, sold to John 
Turberville for £525 her right to 500 acres of land which 
was included in the Turberville patent near the falls of 


269 


the Potomac. The right to and title or interest in the 
other 500 acres had been acquired for £100 by John 
Turberville 25 May 1762 from William Booth and Elizabeth 
his wife of Cople Parish, Westmoreland County, and Ann 
Washington, widow of Augustine. (Fx. Deeds E:13l) 

Two weeks after making his will in 17^1, George 
Turberville sold, or traded 110 acres of the 3402 acre 
tract for 100 acres in Cople Parish belonging to John 
Lucas. (Pr. Wm. Deeds E:24l) John Lucas held the land 
until 15 July 1754 when he sold the 110 acres to Daniel 
Jenings. (Fx. Deeds C:783) Daniel Jennings and Ann his 
wife, "for love and affection they have and bear unto 
Martha Asberry, wife of Thomas," deeded the 110 acres 
lately purchased by Daniel Jennings, dec'd., father to 
Daniel Jennings of this deed. (Fx. Deeds D:638) 

Another parcel taken out of the 3402 acre grant was a 
tract of 319 acres sold 2 November 1741 by George 
Turberville to Blanchflower Dunkin "during his natural 
life and thereafter to use and behoof of John Dunkin and 
Blanchflower Dunkin, sons to Blanchflower by Lettice his 
wife . . . to be equally divided between them . . ." 

John Dunkin died intestate and without issue; Blanchflower 
died intestate, but with issue. Gerrard John Dunkin, 
eldest son and hei r-at-law , "for some time past of Roan 
County in North Carolina," sold the 319 acres to David 
Davies for £136. (Fx. Deeds M;297. 3 August 1773) 

David Davies, supposedly to clear up the title, bought 
for £75 from Rev. Benjamin Sebastian, of Northumberland 
County, "land purchased of Blanchflower Dunkin and 
Lettice his wife" by the late Benjamin Sebastian of 
Fairfax County. (Fx. Deeds L:78. 21 October 1773) This 

evidently refers to the deed made 4 October 1765 where 
Blanchflower Duncan and Lettice his wife sold for £83 to 
Benjamin Sebastian "for and during natural lives of them 
the said Blanchef lower Duncan and his wife Lettice." 

(Fx. Deeds G : 16 ) 

A total of 2973 acres of Woodberry remained in the 
Turberville family and was devised to John Turberville by 
George Turberville in his will 16 October 1740. John 
Turberville, who also inherited the home plantation of 
Hickory Hill, married his first cousin Martha Corbin. 

12 November 1796 John Turberville deeded 400 acres on the 
Potomac to his son Charles L. C. Turberville whose will 
of 4 February 1798 was proved 21 September 1801 in Fairfax 
County. His estate was divided into three parts. His 
sisters Mrs. Lettice Jones and Martha Turberville and his 


270 


brother Troilus Levin Turberville shared equally. 

Only four of the ten children of John Turberville are 
listed in his vill 21 March 1799. (Westmoreland County 
Wills No. 20. Lee of V irginia , pp. 94-95) 

Troilus Levin Turberville received: the lands on Scotts 
Run adjacent to General Lee, Scott, Carter and Hunter, 
"upwards of 3000 acres"; three tracts, tvo of Taylor and 
one of Turberville, of nearly 800 acres; all lands in 
that part of Fairfax "lately taken off Loudoun"; and all 
land in Loudoun. 

Troilus Levin Turberville died, unmarried, in 1003. His 
lands vere divided 24 December l8l6 by order of Westmore- 
land County Court. Woodberry, the Scotts Run tract, vas 
surveyed by Edmund Payne and found to contain 2828 acres 
vhich vere divided and alloted as follovs : Matrom Ball 
and his vife Martha Corbin received 1503 acres and the 
heirs of Lettice Jones and Eusebeus Jones received the 
rest of the Scotts Run tract, or 1325 acres. 

The creditors of Troilus L. Turberville instituted a 
suit against the heirs and by a final decree 19 May 1830 
the lands vere divided into lots and sold. Mottram Ball 
purchased lot No. 1, vhich had been allotted to him 
originally, for $1853.55. The heirs of Lettice Jones 
purchased all but 124 acres of the other half. 

Troilus Levin Turberville devised to the heirs of 
George L. Turberville the Frying Pan land on Horsepen 
Run of 1557 acres and the 800 acres near the little 
falls of the Potomac. This land vas also involved in 
the suit brought by his creditors and vas allotted and 
sold in the same manner by a final decree of the court 
in 1830. 

The 1557 acres vere part of Francis Avbrey's grant vhich 
had been sold to John Tayloe and regrant«!d to him. 

Tayloe sold to John Turberville. Robert Beale sold 957 
acres of the 1557 to Josiah Wilcoxen 30 December 1842 
for $4,306.50. Josiah Wilcoxen and Francis his vife 
mortgaged the property to Spencer Jackson in 1843 and in 
1859 sold the 957 acres to Homer Duguid and Courtlandt 
Duguid for $9,570.00. (Fx. Deeds H3:8l) Homer and Mercy 
Duguid and Courtlandt and Jane Duguid sold in four parcels 
1030 acres to W. N. Dickerson, Henry Halbert and Daniel 
Janney. (Fx. Deeds Q3:225, T4:474 and V4:45)

TREES MENTIONED IN COLONIAL SURVEYS 

"To pursue the proper descriptions of our land 
boundaries would render men’s titles very precarious, 
not only from the variations of the compass, but that 
old surveys were often inaccurate; and mistakes often 
made, in copying their descriptions into the patents; 
leaving out lines, and putting north for south, and 
east for west; and in copying those descriptions into 
subsequent conveyances: Whereas, the marked trees 
upon the land remain invariable, according to which 
neighbours hold their distinct lands. On this ground, 
our Juries have uniformly, and wisely, never suffered 
such lines, when proved, to be departed from, because 
they do not agree exactly with descriptions in convey- 
ances . 11 

October Court , 1802 

Call 1 s Reports , Vol. Ill, p. 211 

Trees used by colonial surveyors to mark points on surveys 
were given their common names; however, the common names of 
trees, especially oaks, are widely varied and often confusing. 
Different names are applied to the same tree, or one name may 
be given to many different trees. 

The selection of trees used as illustrations was made on 
the basis of representative trees found in Fairfax County. 

For example, the pignut hickory was used as it is more typical 
of this area than the shagbark hickory, just as the black 
locust is more typical than the honey locust. (interview: 

D. E. Sheads, Forester of Fairfax County, State of Virginia 
Division of Forestry) 

Some trees are missing. The chestnut is near extinction 
in Virginia since the introduction of the chestnut blight from 
Asia in 1906. (Forest Trees of Vi rg inia , p. 28) Illustrations 
were not found for the following oaks: black, chestnut, water, 
gray, box, ring and live. 

Dark bark, almost black, which has deep rough furrows is 
characteristic of the rugged black oak which lives one hundred 
fifty years or more. Named because its leaf resembles that of 
the chestnut, the chestnut oak is usually found on rocky moun- 
tain ridges. The willow oak, true to its name, has willow-like 
foliage and bears acorns. Weaker than the white oak and less 
resistant to decay, the red oak is sometimes called gray oak. 
The box oak, or post oak, is often found on poor, sandy upland 
soils . 

The Spanish oak was named in a report by William Penn in 
1683 when he was listing the natural treasures of his new 
Commonwealth. In Virginia the Spanish oak is commonly called 
the "chief inhabitant and oldest settler." (Peattie, N atur al 


291 


History of Trees, p. 221) These lovely trees, sometimes 

called Southern Red oaks, are often seen around courthouses 

and squares. 

a. Lohlolly Pine: Tall, fast growing member of yellow pine 
group; dark furrowed bark. 

b. Yellow Poplar, or Tulip Tree: Straight, central trunk 
often clear of limbs for 30 to 50 feet; narrow pyramidal 
head; attractive, tulip-like flowers. 

c. White Ash: Average height of 50 to 80 feet; bark varies 
in color from light gray to gray-brown and has narrow 
ridges separated by deep, diamond-shaped fissures. 

d. Pignut Hickory: Tapering trunk and narrow oval head; 
bark close, ridged and grayish. 

e. Sweet Gum: Symmetrical, rough, light gray bark; brilliant 
coloring in fall. 

f. Sycamore: Large, rapid growing, occasionally attains 
height of lUO to 170 feet; often forks into large second- 
ary trunks; massive spreading limbs form open head; outer 
bark flakes off each year to expose nearly white younger 
bark. 

g . Black Walnut: Straight stem clear of branches for half 
its height if grown in forest; sharply divided trunk. 

h. White Pine: Average height of 80 to 100 feet; straight 
stem with soft gray-green foliage; branches arranged in 
circles on stem. 

i. Beech: Produces a dense shade; bark is most distinctive-- 
an unbroken, light gray surface throughout its life. 

,1 . Red Maple: Quick growing, relatively short lived, 
medium sized tree; brilliant foliage in fall. 

k. Flowering Dogwood: Small tree usually 15 to 30 feet high 
with flat, spreading crown and short, often crooked 
trunk; masses of early spring flowers. 

l. Birch: Distinctive ragged, layered bark. 

m. Black Locust: Trunk usually divided; wood is very durable 
on contact with soil; used extensively for fence posts and 
poles . 

n. Pin Oak: Single, upright stem with numerous tough branch- 
es; lower branches drooping, middle branches horizontal, 
upper branches ascending. 

o. Southern Red Oak: Average height 70 to 80 feet; large 
spreading branches; broad, round, open top; bark is rough, 
but not deeply furrowed and varies from light gray on 
younger trees to almost black on older trees. 

p. American Elm: Fan, or vase-shaped with pendulous branches 
one of the most desirable shade trees. 

q. White Oak: Broad crown with far-xeaching limbs.

SURVEYORS 

"And because the quiet of our estates, in a 
great measure, depends upon the faithfulness, 
understanding and care of our surveyors, and 
the fair and regular keeping of their pro- 
ceedings, Be it enacted . • . " 

3 Hening, Statutes , 331. October 1705 

Surveyors were key individuals in a society where land and 
improvements made on the land signified wealth. The records 
that testified to title of land were the most important of all 
colonial records. If the surveyor was not competent, many con- 
tentious disputes would arise. There were so many counter 
claims to pieces of land that the Virginia General Assembly 
passsed legislation which provided that a claimant had to com- 
pensate an occupant on his patent or accept a fair price for 
his title. No challenge to title could be made after five 
years of peaceful occupation. 

The Assembly of 1662 explained, "the least variation of 
a compasse alters the scituation of a whole neighbourhood." 

Laws governing processioning were passed at this time and 
owners were required to keep boundary trees freshly marked. 

(2 Hening Stat ute s 101-102) 

Prior to 169 3 surveyors were appointed by the Surveyor 
General of Virginia who was an appointee of the Governor from 
1621-1624 and an appointee of the King from 162U-I693. The 
College of William Mary, established by royal charter 
8 February 1693, discharged the function of the Office of 
Surveyor General and the faculty nominated, examined and 
licensed surveyors. The Governor and Council, in spite of the 
royal charter, assumed supervisory power over appointments of 
surveyors generals and the appointment of county surveyors. 

Appointments were often recorded in the court order books 
or deed books of the county. In a Stafford County Deed Book 
it is recorded that Peter Beverly, Esq., of Gloucester County, 
was appointed to execute the "platt and office" of Surveyor 
General of the Colony. He appointed John Savage, Gent., to be 
Surveyor of Stafford County 11 February 1723. (Stafford 
County Deed Book 1722-1728, p. 117) 

After 1693 county surveyors could appoint deputies. The 
surveyors, who received instructions from the Governor and 
Council, delivered to the auditor every April a list of all 
surveys made during the year. The surveyor general and the 
secretary kept a record of all land surveyed. (Baldwin, 
Surveying and Manning, pp. l80-l8l) 

Surely a list was also kept of the men who were appointed 
county surveyors , but such records have not been found except 
for one list in the Manuscript Division of the Library of 
Congress, dated 1757, which gives the surveyors for fifty 


293 


counties of Virginia. The list gives the date they vere 
appointed and the date of their bonds; some were appointed as 
early as 1740. For Fairfax County, John West is listed, "but 
the John is crossed out and -George is written above. The 
dates given are 20 March 1754 and 1756. (Ac. 1808, Manuscripts 
Division, Library of Congress) 

Daniel Jenings, the firsb known County Surveyor of 
Fairfax County, continued in office until approximat ely 1753. 
John West, Jr., was authorized to survey and plat the townsite 
of Alexandria. The map, finished before 13 July 1749, was used 
for the sale of lots. George West surveyed and made the plat 
for the town of Colchester in 1754. 

The knowledge of surveying and mapping was useful through- 
out George Washington ! s life. Active in surveying in the 
Shenandoah Valley for about five years, from 1747 to 1752, 
Washington also continued to periodically survey and map his 
lands at Mount Vernon. (Wise, Pr ocee dings , p. 301) 

William Payne, the last surveyor of Fairfax County in the 
eighteenth century, was recommended to the Governor for the 
position of sheriff. He stated that he would not have any ob- 
jection to accepting the office, as he would farm it out to 
good men qualified to "do the Business, (as hath generally 
been the custom here.)" He thought there was an advantage to 
attending a survey in a double capacity since the parties 
could not always get a magistrate to attend when witnesses 
were to be examined on oath. He concluded that if it was con- 
sidered to be illegal to hold both offices, he would "cheerfully 
submit" but would continue as surveyor. ( Calendar o f St ate 
Papers, Vol. VII, p. 269) 

Surveyors fees were fixed by law. Not only were fees set. 
for actual surveys, but they were also set for various related 
activities such as receiving a warrant and giving a receipt, 
recording a certificate, making an entry for land or copying a 
plat or certificate of survey. (10 Hening, Statutes 126-127) 

In 1666 the fee was 40 pounds Tob? for every 100 acres sur- 
veyed. In the 17^0' s the basic fee for a new survey and plat 
of not more than 1000 acres was 500 pounds Tob? From 1887 to 
1919 a surveyor was paid one cent per pole for the first hun- 
dred poles or any "less distance." After the first one hundred 
poles they were paid one half cent per pole. They were paid 
fifty cents for each of the following: 

1. for calculating the quantity of less than six courses; 

2. for calculating each division of less than six 
courses ; 

3. for making a plat of six courses, or less; 

4. for recording a plat and certificate of not more than 
six courses ; 

5. for copy of plat of not more than six courses; 

6. for making an entry. 

There were small charges for every "course above six." 
Another fee set by law was for travel. Surveyors were allowed 
five cents a mile for traveling to the place of surveying and 


294 


returning . 

The person for vhom the survey was made paid the fee to 
the surveyor. After 1729 one-sixth of surveyors fees in 
Virginia went to the College of William and Mary. (Baldwin, 
Surveying and Ma pping , p. 182) The College of William and 
$fary continued to examine and certify surveyors; they received 
one-sixth of the surveyors* fees in Virginia until 1787 when 
objections were made by inhabitants of Kentucky and Harrison, 
Monongalia, Randolph and Ohio counties (later West Virginia), 
who wanted to establish their own schools. The Assembly in 
1787 enacted legislation that one-sixth of the fees collected 
in the Kentucky district and West Virginia area should be paid 
respectively to the Transylvania Seminary and Randolph 
Ac ademy . 

Voters elected county surveyors in 1870 to serve four year 
terms beginning 1 January 1871. Judges of the county court 
were to appoint men to serve until the elctions were held. 

(Acts of the General Assembly, 1869, Chap. 179, Sec. ih) By 
iwr surveyors were appointed by each county court Judge, 
upon the recommendations of the board of supervisors. (Code 
of Virg ini a , 1887, Sec. 95) 

At the beginning of the twentieth century the county 
surveyor was responsible for all the surveys for county roads 
and the school system, and approved surveys made by independent, 
individual surveyors. It was his responsibility to make sure 
they conformed to criteria set by the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
In Arlington County the Office of Surveyor was discontinued in 
1932. 

When Fairfax County came under the County Executive form 
of government in 1952, the office of County Surveyor was 
abolished. The Division of Design Review is currently respon- 
sible for accepting surveys made by independent surveyors in 
the county. Under the Project Engineering Division, the 
Survey Branch makes surveys on county projects, excluding 
School, Water and Park Divisions who have their own survey 
branches . 

Individuals are now licensed as surveyors by the Common- 
wealth of Virginia, Just as many years ago they were certified 
by the College of William and Mary. As the method of licensing 
has changed, so have the surveying instruments. Many improve- 
ments were made to the basic transit; these improvements 
resulted in the surveyor increasing both speed and accuracy in 
his work. Today a surveyor can measure distances of more than 
a mile in one optical pointing, with the flick of a switch, and 
in less than ten seconds. With another switch and the aid of a 
computer built into the instrument, he can triangulate in a 
matter of seconds instead of consulting logarithm tables and 
making calculations. 

The surveys accompanying title to land in Fairfax County 
for over three hundred years, however, were made without the 
electronic equipment available today. It iB a tribute to the 
skill and ability of surveyors and the men who have served as 


295 


county surveyors that the surveying records provide a basis 
for the orderly transfer of title to land in Fairfax County and 
Arlington County today.

Other surveyors worked in Fairfax and Arlington counties 
and their surveys are included in the series of Northern Neck 
Surveys at the Virginia State Library and in the records of 
Fairfax County. Some of them were Deputy Surveyors and were 
listed in the Court Order Books. Others, such as Guy 
Broadwater and John Hough, were more active in other counties.

COMPASS ROSES 


The compass roses that surveyors used were often decor- 
ative as well as utilitarian. Since a North indicator was a 
necessary part of every survey, many examples are available. 
Certain styles seem to be distinctive hallmarks of various 
early surveyors. Later surveyors used a simpler form which 
was referred to as a North arrow. 

The following are from a collection made of Steve Hogan 
of the Graphic Section, Division of Mapping. The originals 
of the surveys listed pages 1-3 can be found in the Northern 
Neck Loose Surveys, Virginia State Library, Archives Division. 
The originals of the remaining three pages can be found in

Before 1678 Royal Patents had teen granted for 14.5# of 
Fairfax County. This number includes only those patents for 
which there were valid claims. The Royal patents on which 
the computation was based include:

total acreage of the 

above 

patents is 41,425 1 

acres • 


Fairfax County, for the purpose of this report, has a 


total of 285,560 acres, 
following : 


Included in this total are the 


Fairfax County 
Arlington County 
Alexandria 
Falls Church 
Fairfax City 


In an attempt to realistically portray the actual number 
of acres granted, all regrants, invalid grants, and disputed 
grants were discarded when computing the percentage of the 
county granted during the designated periods. 

As an obvious example, Ravensworth, first granted in 1694 , 
was re-granted in 1791. If the 24,112 acres were added to the 
grants in the 1776-1875 period, the percentage would change 
from 2.55# to 10.99# and would not represent an accurate 
picture of the acreage granted.
