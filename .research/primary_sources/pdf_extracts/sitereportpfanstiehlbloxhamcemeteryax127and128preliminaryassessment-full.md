This  Prelimiruuy  Archaeological  Assessment  of the  proposed  Alexandria 
Business Center in  Alexandria,  Virginia has been prepared  at  the  request  of CSX 
Realty  by  Engineerin6-Science,  Inc.  The  study  provides  an  overview  of  the 
prehistonc  and  histonc  development  of  the  study  area,  evaluates  the  existing 
. conditions,  describes  historic  themes,  sites,  structures,  technology,  individuals  and 
"  events associated with the property, and assesses the archaeological potential of the 

site. 

The  study  area  has  a  medium  to  bigh  (>Otential  to  contain  si~ficant 
archaeological resources related to prehistoric activity as well as the late eighteenth, 
nineteenth  and  twentieth  century  historic  periodS. 
It  is  recommended  that 
subsurface  testing  be conducted  within the  project  area  prior to  development  to 
detennine whether these predicted resources remain beneath the twentieth century 
railroad fill deposits.

.".' 

The  purpose  of  the  Alexandria  Business  Center ' Preliminary 
Archaeological  Study  is  to  conduct  an  archaeological  overview  and  assessment  to 
the 
detennine  the  presence  or  absence  of  archaeological  deposits  within 
development area (Figure 1) and to assess their potential significance, if present. 

It is expected that materials may remain from  the nineteenth century related 
to  the  use  and  occupation  of the  area,  which  was  adjacent  to  the  Little  River 
Turnpike.  an  important early  road.  Nineteentb century historic maps indicate  that 
structures were located near or within the property. and grist mills were located east 
and west of the property.  The Bloxham family  cemetery is also on the site.  During 
the twentieth century the prope'C'l' has been used for railroad maintenance activities. 
There  is  also  a  medium  to  hIgh  potential  of  prehistoric  archaeological  sites 
remaining on the property. 

A  field  survey  was  conducted  of  the  project  area  to  conduct  a  visual 
inspection of the land surfaces and known outbuildmgs associated with  the  historic 
use  of  the  pro!?,:rty.  A  preliminary  assessment  was  made  of  recent  ground 
disturbances  whIch  may  have  destroyed  archaeological  deposits.  Above  ground 
structures were photographed and included within the site analysis report. 

A documentary research of deeds, maps,  surveys and other archival material 
was  conducted  in  local  and  regional  repositories  to  understand  the  landuse  and 
development history of the project area. 

This report is intended to detail the historical background and land use of the 
project  area,  including rrehistoric  occupation  prior  to  the  seventeenth  century, 
the  historic  and  prehistoric  land  use  and  present  an 
provide  an  overview  0 
assessment of the archaeological potential of the project area. 

The  study  was  conducted  by  professional  archaeologists  meeting  the 
qualifications specified by the  Secretary of the  Interior's Standards and Guidelines 
and  the  Archaeology  Preservation  Guidelines  of  the  City  of  Alexandria,  as 
interpreted by the City Archaeologist.

PRO]ECI' DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The  project  area  is  located  approximately  two  miles  from  the  historic 
Alexandria waterfront and  northwest of Hunting Creek.  The Alexandria  Business 
Center  site  is  between  Duke  Street,  South  Quaker  Lane,  Calvin  Street,  and 
Telegraph Road within the City of Alexandria (Figure 2). 

The site  is  less  than  a  mile  north of Cameron  Run,  a  tributary of Hunting 
Creek,  and  in  the  past  several  streams  ran  north/south  through  the  site.  The 
current elevation is generally leve~ as is expected in a railyard, ranging from 41  feet 
on the north to 40 feet on the south.  Commonly eaIIed "Fruit Growers", the site has 
had  a  rail  line  forming  the  southern boundary  since  the  mid-nineteenth  century. 
Prior to and after that period, the land was used for  farmsteads,  with  dwellin~ and 
commercial  establishments  immediately  south  of  little  River  Turnpike  (Duke 
Street).

A. 

Climate 

., . 

The  climate  in  the  vicinity  of the  project  area  is  characterized  as  humid, 
semi·continential,  with  meteorological  systems  generally  flowing  west  to  east. 
Seasonal variations  exist, and  summer and fall  are generally dominated by  tropical 
air masses originating in the Gulf of Mexico and  moyin~ northward, while winter is 
more  fre'lu:ntly  characterized  by  intensely  cold,  dry  alf  streaming  out  of central 
Canada  ~Mack  1966).  The  avera~e  temperature  range  is  from  48.2  degrees 
Fahrenheit to 663 degrees Fahrenhell.  Average annual precipitation is 38.7 inches, 
of which  17.7 inches fall in the form of snow (ibid.). 

B. 

Geology 

The  project  area  is  wholly  contained  within  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain 
physio~aphlc province.  The  geology  of the  area  is  typical  of the  Coastal  Plain, 
which  IS characterized by a series of unconsolidated deposits of gravel, sand, silt and 
clay ranging in age from the Cretaceous to Recent periods. 

The  Coastal  Plain  province  does  not  provide  any  primary  lithic  sources. 
However,  secondary  deposits  of  cobbles  and  gravels  are  commonly  exposed  in 
streambeds  and  relict  river  channels  and  on  old  marine  and  river  terraces 
(Wentworth  1930).  Quartz  is  the  most  abundant  lithic  material  in  the  region. 
Quartzite is also common while chert and jasper pebbles are occasionally available. 
The nearby Piedmont Uplands province also serves as a source for lithic matcrials 
botb as outcrops in primary form  and as secondary deposits of cobbles and pebbles 
in streambeds. 

The  Cameron  Run  wbich  is  a  04th  order  watershed  is  just  south  of tbe 
project  area  Two  small  tributaries  to  Cameron  Run  previously  existed  in  tbe 
project area, but these have been filled in since the early twentieth century.

PREHISTORIC AND  HISTORIC BACKGROUND 

A. 

Prehistoric Background 

The  project  area  is  situated  in  the  Middle  Atlantic  region  of the  eastern 
U~ted .States.  The prehistory of this region is traditionally divided. into three major 
penods.  the Paleo-IndIan (ca.  10,000 B.c. - 7,000 B.c.), the ArchaIC  (ca. 7,000 B.c. 
- 1,000  B.c.),  and  the  Woodland  (ca.  1,000  B.C.  - AD.  1,600).  These  cultural 
periods  represent  a  taxonomic  deVIce,  whereby  changes  in  material  culture  and 
subsistence  strategies are emphasized.  Shifts  in  the  types  of artifacts  often  reflect 
technological transformations, which can be seen as  adaptive  responses to  changing 
environmental  conditions  (Allan  and  Stuart  1977).  Thus  a  discussion  of  the 
archaeological  background  of  northern  Virginia  must  combine  aspects  of  the 
environment,  subsistence  base,  and  artifactual  record.  The  model  for  prehistoric 
site  distribution  which  results  from  such  a  discussion  enables  archaeologists  to 
predict  the  most  likely  locations  for  sites  of  the  different  time  periods  (Gardner 
1978,  1982;  Bromberg  1987).  A  model  of  this  nature  is  a  useful  tool  for 
preservationists, for  it  allows  them  to jud~e the  likelihood  of finding sites  in  areas 
threatened by development, such as Washmgton National Airport. 

Paleo-Indian Period.  The record of human  habitation in  northern  Virginia 
began some  12,000  years  ago,  concurrent  with  the  final  retreat  of the  Wisconsin 
{'Olar  ice  cap.  Based  on  data from  the  Shenandoah  Vallef in  Virginia,  Carbone 
(1976)  has  proposed that the  cool  and  moist  Late Glacial  chmate, characteristic of 
the  Paleo-IndIan  period,  resulted  in  a  Middle  Atlantic  vegetation  pattern  of 
extensive open grassland areas interspersed with a mosaic of various forested zones. 
This mosaic pattern created extensive ecotone areas between deciduous, coniferous, 
grassland  and  floodplain  flora.  These  habitats were  suitable  for  a  high  density of 
grazing  and  browsing  fauna  (Carbone  1976).  Game  and  a  variety  of plants were 
also exploited during this period. 

The  characteristic  artifact  of  the  Paleo-Indian  period  is  the  fluted  stone 
point,  often  made  of hi$h  quality  lithic material  such  as  chert  or jasper  (Gardner 
1974,  1979).  These  pomts,  used  as  spear  tips,  are  relatively  rare  throughout  the 
Mid-Atlantic.  The region's most  intensively studied Paleo-Indian sites are situated 
in  the  Shenandoah  Valley  of Virginia.  Excavation  of these  sites  has  indicated  a 
tendency for  Paleo-Indian base camps  to  be situated  in  areas of maximum  habitat 
overlap  near  sources of cryptoctyStalline  stone,  such  as  chert  and jasper  (Gardner 
1974, 1979). 

Other quarry-related sites,  base  camp  maintenance stations at nearby game 
attractive  locales,  and  hunting  camps  further  removed  from  the  base  camp 
com~leted the picture of the Paleo-Indian settlement pattern (Gardner 1974,1979). 
A  SImilar  pattern  has  been  noted  for  areas  in  northern  Delaware  where 
cryptocrystalline stone is available (Custer and  DeSantis 1986).  In central Delaware 
where this high quality lithic material was not available, Custer and DeSantis (1986) 
have  suggested  that  base  camps  were  located  on  well-drained  ridges  in  areas  of 
maximum  habitat  overlap, with  base  camp  maintenance  stations  at  game-attractive 
locales nearby,  and huntmg sites  at game-attractive locales farther removed.  In  the 
future, other settlement patterns may be detected for  the Paleo-Indian period in  the 
Middle  Atlantic  region,  and  it  is possible  that  some  sites  are  located  on  the  now 
submerged continental shelf (Kraft and Chacko 1978). 



7 

A  small  number  of  early  fluted  point  types  have  been  found  scattered 
throughout Fairfax County (Johnson  1986), and  a few  diagnostic  artifacts dating to 
the  Paleo-Indian  period  can  be  found  in  the  local  collections  at  the  Sl)lithsonian 
Institution's National Museum of Natural History.  The  known  Paleo-Indian sites in 
the vicinity of the project area are characterized as  isolated  point finds.  Their role 
in  the  Paleo-Indian settlement pattern is  difficult  to  assess.  Perhaps they represent 
hunting  sites  or  ephemeral  occupations.  Given  the  nature  of  these  finds,  it  is 
probable  that occupation in the vicinity of the project area was sparse and sporadic 
during the Paleo-Indian period. 

Archaic Period  The subsequent Archaic Period lasted from about 7,000 B.C. 
to  1,000  B.C.  The open grassland  areas of Late  Glacial  times  disappeared  as  oak 
hickory  forests  closed  in  upon  them,  and  the  large  Pleistocene  herd  animals  had 
become extinct (Carbone  1976).  A generalized foraging  pattern emerged to exploit 
the resources  in the  newly created  environments.  As  the foragers spread into new 
areas in search of available game and vegetable resources, they began to use locally 
available  materials  such  as  quartz  and  quartzite  for  theIr  tool  manufacture. 
Population  rose,  fueled  by  varied  and  successful  adaptations  to  the  changing 
environmenL  Early, Middle and Late Archaic sub-periods have been defined to aid 
in describing the chronological history of the Middle Atlantic. 

The  Early  Archaic  period  (ca  7,000  B.c.  - 6,500  B.c.)  is  marked  by  the 
introduction  of  a  number  of  new  projectile  point  styles.  Among  the  cultural 
diagnostics of this period are the corner-notched, serrated Palmer and  Kirk  points, 
the  slightly  later  Kirk-stemmed  types,  and  the  still  later  bifurcate  base  points 
(leCroy, Kanawha).  These new point styles probably reflect a change in subsistence 
strategy,  from  a  primary  reliance  on  the  hunting  of big  game  to  an  increasing 
utilization of plants and smaller animals. 

The  trend  toward  forest  closure  continued  throughout  the  Middle  Archaic 
period (ca.  6,500 B.C.  - 2,500  B.C.).  About 5,000  B.C. a  shift to warmer and  drier 
conditions  occurred,  and  marked  seasonality  between  winter  and  summer 
temperatures became apparent.  In addition to the climate and associated floral  and 
faunal  changes,  variations  in  sea  level  were  occurring,  thereby  creating  other  new 
environmental zones.  With the retreat of the glaciers, the Chesapeake Bay began to 
form  through  inundation  of the  ancient  Susquehanna  River  system.  By  ca.  6,500 
B.C.  this  inundation would  have already begun to cause ponding and the formation 
of wetland  habitats  in  the  major rivers  feeding  the  bay  as  well  as  in  some of their 
tributaries. 

It is  generally  agreed  that  by  the  Middle  Archaic  period  (ca.  6,500  B.c.  -
2,500  B.C.),  local  populations  had  adopted  a  generalized  foraging  lifestyle  in 
response  to  the  changed  environmental  conditions.  The  numerous  edge  areas 
created by the environmental changes offered  a wide variety of seasonally available 
floral  and  faunal  resources.  Gardner  (1978)  believes  that  the focus  of the  Middle 
Archaic subsistence settlement pattern was  at  lar~e inland swamp  areas, formed  as 
the  sea  level  rose  in  post-glacIal  times.  In  addition  to  occupation  at  the  inland 
swamp base camps,  seasonal fissioning would  have  occurred to take advantage  of a 
broad spectrum,of resources.  It is probable that inland  swamp development on the 
Vir~inia side  of  the  Potomac  near  the  project  area  would  have  been  somewhat 
linuted because the river flows  SO  close to the Piedmont  Uplands in that area.  Any 
extensive  inland swamps which  did  exist  in  the  vicinity of the  project were  probably 

8 

inundated as sea level rose. 

The  succeeding  Late  Archaic  period  (ca.  2500  B.c.  - 1,000  B.C.)  is 
chaIacterized  by  very  warm  and  dry  climatic  conditions.  Forest  closure  continued 
and .reached  its  maximum.  The variety of terrestrial  habitats  decreased  and  edge 
areas were present primarily around rivers and streams (Carbone 1976).  The rate of 
rising  sea  level  slowed,  thereby  allowing  for  the  creation  of riverine  and  estuarine 
environments  stable  enough  to  support  significant  populations  of  shellfish  and 
anadronous fish  (Custer  1978;  Gardner  1978).  The  focus  of settlement  had again 
this  time  to  the  rivers  and  estuaries, 
shifted  during  the  Late  Archaic  period  -
probably  to  take  advantage  of  predictable  fisb  and  sbellfish  resources  and  to 
maintain settlements  in the  only available  edge areas as  the forest closure reached 
its maximum. 

During the  Late  Archaic period, there  is  a  great  increase  in  the  number  of 
sites.  Some  sites  in  riverine  and  estuarine  locales  tend  to  be  larger  and  more 
complex  than  any  occupied  during  previous  periods,  thereby  indicating  a  trend 
toward sedentism.  In tbe vicinity of the project area, Gardner (1982) maintains that 
large  Late  Archaic  spring/summer  base  camps  occurred  near  good  anadronous 
fishing  wnes  and  that  smaller  fall/winter  base  camps  were  situated  in  interior 
freshwater  settings.  Smaller,  more  transient  camps  were  present  in  a  variety  of 
environments  to  offer  additional  support  to  tbe  large  and  small  base  camp 
occupations.  Cultural diaS!'ostics of thIS period include steatite vessels several types 
of  broad-bladed  points  (Savannah  River,  Susquebanna  -- mainly  found  in  the 
Piedmont, and Holmes - primarily confined to the  Coastal Plain).  Possibly serving 
as  knives,  the  new  points  may  bave  been  designed  to  exploit  the  new  riverine 
resources. 

Woodland  Period  Around  1,000  B.C.  pottery  was  introduced.  This 
artifactual innovation defines the beginning of the Woodland  period which,  like the 
Arcbaic, is traditionally divided into early, middle and  late sub-periods.  The earliest 
known  ceramic  in  the  area,  used  from  about  1,200  B.C. to  800  B.c., is  a steatite 
tempered  variety  referred  to  as  Marcey  Creek  ware  after  its  type  site  on  the 
Potomac  River  in  Arlington  County,  Virginia  (Manson  1948).  A  subsequent 
diagnostic ceramic type o(the Early Woodland period is the sand and grit-tempered 
Accokeek ware in use from about 800 B.c. to 300 B.c. 

In  general,  the  Late  Archaic  lifestyle  continued  into  the  Early  Woodland 
period  (ca.  1,000  B.C.  - 500  B.c.).  While  the  deliberate  and  intensive  foraging 
strategies  of  the  preceding  period  appear  to  have  remained  unchanged,  there  is 
some evidence  for  an  increase  in  sedentism  as  the  inhabitants  of the  area  became 
more efficient in  exploiting the available resources.  Gardner (1982)  has postulated 
that,  rather  than breaking up  into  small base  camps in  interior freshwater  settings, 
occupants  of  the  large  sprIng/summer  base  camps  in  anadronous  fishing  zones 
regrouped  in  the  fall  and  winter  near  tbe  freshwater/saltwater  transition  to  take 
advantage  of  the  abundant  shellfish  resources  there.  Though  horticulture  was 
practiced  in  other  areas  at  this  time,  there  has  been  no  concrete  evidence  of its 
existence in the Middle Atlantic. 

The Middle Woodland lifestyle (ca. 500 B.C. - AD. 9(0) appears to resemble 
!hat of its pred,ecessor with.a h!lnting,  gath~ring, and  fi~hing subsistence base.  There 
IS  some  evidence  for  a  shift  m  the  locatIOns  of  seml·sedentary  base  camps  from 
small  creek  floodplains  to  large  river  floodplains  (Snyder  and  Gardner  1979:9). 
This shift may have helped to set the stage for the development of horticulture.  The 

-

9 

early Middle Woodland period (ca. 500 B.c. - AD. 2(0) in  the area is characterized 
by a thick ware, known locally as Popes Creek, tempered with coarse sand or quartz 
and usually  impressed  with  nets.  By  late  Middle  Woodland  times  (ca.  A.D.  200  -
A.D. 900),  a  shift to the  shell-tempered, often cord·marked or net-impressed ware, 
locally called Mockley, had occurred. 

By  the Late  Woodland  Period  (AD. 900 - A.D.  1600),  the  development  of 
horticulture  began  to  achieve  a  significant  role  in  the  total  subsistence  system. 
Maize, squash and beans were probably the focus  of initial agricultural efforts.  The 
significance of an agriculturally·based subsistence strategy cannot be overestimated; 
no  other  factor  is  as  crucial  in  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of permanent. 
year-round setUements.  Sedentary villages were establisbed near the fertile  soils of 
riverine  floodplains  (Barber  1979).  Smaller,  less  permanent  sites  in  a  variety  of 
settings  attest  to  the  fact  that  other  resources  were  still  being  utilized.  Anifacts 
diagnostic of Late Woodland occupation in the area include triangular points, shell 
tempered  Rappahannock  ceramics  of  the  Townsend  series,  and  Potomac  Creek 
ware. 

As  the  Late  Woodland  Period  progressed,  tbe  size  and  complexity  of the 
villa~es and  settlement systems  in  the  Mid-Atlantic  increased,  with  fortifications, 
speClal~d societal roles, development of inter-tribal alliances, growth of inter-tribal 
goverrunental  authority  and  a  bigher  degree  of complexity  in  the  observation  of 
religious and ceremonial activities (Barber 1979; Snow 1978). 

During  the  period  of  initial  European  onntact,  the  Fairfax  County  and 
Alexandria  were  inhabited  by  the  Conoy,  a  tribal  confederation  of  Algonquin 
spealcing  people  of  the  north.  Captain  John  Smith,  in  his  1608  voyage  up  the 
Potomac River, noted the presence of the village of Nameranghquend near tbe area 
wbicb  is  currently  occupied  by  National  Airport.  By  1714  the  last  of  northern 
Virginia's  native  inhabitants  bad  moved  to  tbe  upper  reaches  of  the  Mattaponi 
River. 

The  project  area  clearly  has  the  potential  to  yield  evidence  of prehistoric 
occupation.  While  the  probability  of  discemins  evidence  of  Paleo-Indian 
occupation is low as a result of only sparse and sporadtc use of the area at that time, 
the probability increases for the Early and Middle Archaic periods as people spread 
out  to  exploit  resources  in  the  changing  environment.  Inland  swamps  may  have 
been present in  the  vicinity  during  the  Middle  Archaic  period,  and these  marshes 
are  postulated  to  have  been  the  focal  points  of  the  Middle  Archaic  settlement 
system.  The project area could yield  evidence  of Middle Archaic forays  into other 
environments near the swampland. 

With  the  great  increase  in  the  number  of  sites  in  the  vicinity  during  the 
succeeding  period,  Late  Archaic  occupation  within  the  project  area  is  even  more 
likely.  Research along other streams in the Vicinity of Alexandria and the fall  zone 
of the  Potomac River would  indicate  there is  a  high  probability of prehistoric sites 
being  found  within  the  project  area  Recent  work  on  Masons  Neck  by  Fairfax 
County Heritage Resources, the survey of the Neabsco and Powells Creek to nearby 
Prince William  County (Barse  & Gardner  1982) and  the  Countryside survey  (Rust 
1986)  all  indicate  that  aboriginal  sites  are  common  occurrences  along  drainage 
systems.  StrearIl onnfluences  and  relatively  higher elevations  along streams are the 
most likely locations for such sites.

The types  of sites  that are likely to be encountered are usually categorized as 
lithic scatters.  This type of site is typified by concentrations of stone flakes and little 
else.  Many  of  these  are  believed  to  belong  to  the  Late  Archaic  Period  but  the 
Neabsco  and  Powells  Creek  survey  indicates  that  Late  Woodland  sites  are  not 
uncommon.  Sites of other periods are  also possible especially in light of the cobble 
resources of the region that would have provided a readily available source of stone 
for tool manufacture.

Historic Background 

The  project  area  is  located  approximately  two  miles  from  the  historic 
Alexandria waterfront, and northwest of Hunting Creek, which  at the  time  of early 
colonial  settlement  was  called  Great  Hunting  Creek,  which  were  focal  points  of 
early  eighteenth  century settlement and  trading.  Patents were  granted  during  the 
late seventeentb  century to tobacco  planters  and  traders,  who  often speculated  in 
propeny north  of the  Virginia  tidewater  region.  Among  those  early  land  patents 
was one granted to John Carr in 1678 (Figure 3), which  includes the current project 
area  (Beth  Mitchell,  personal  communication)'.  The  land  was  probably  not 
occupied until 1694 when John Simpson had tbe land resurveyed, and sold 313 acres 
of the plat to John West in  1698.  The West family,  many of whom were  prominent 
Fairfax  County  landholders  and  members  of the  gentry  retained  the  part  of  the 
original 627 acres during the eighteenth century, and it was consolidated by Thomas 
West again  in  1790,  although  the  propeny was  the  cause for  much  dispute  during 
this one hundred years (Fairfax County Deeds C/136). 

Thomas West transferred this  land  to Alexander  Smith in 1790, who  then in 
tum sold 40 acres to James Bloxham in  1795.  This fony acre parcel forms  much of 
the project area and remained in the Bloxham family  during most of the nineteenth 
oentury.  During  this  period,  Alexandria  expenenced  economic  growth  and 
devel0p'ment through extensive maritime trade.  The project area was aPl?roximately 
one  mde  west  of the  town's  boundaries.  or  the  "West  End",  and  remamed  within 
Fairfax County.  In 1790, the decision was made to locate the national callital on the 
Potomac  River,  and  Alexandria  was  to  be  part  of  the  federal  district.  Many 
Alexandrians anticipated that George Washington would  push  to locate  the capital 
in  his  home  town.  This  was  an  important  commercial  town,  as  evidenced  by  the 
proliferation of manufacturing and  retailing operations.  Even after the  capital site 
was  located  across  the  river  in  Washin~on City,  future  growth  was  anticipated 
through  the  opening of river  navigation  tnland  VIa  the  Patowmack Canal  that  was 
under construction from the Falls of the Potomac to the Ohio River valley. 

Almost  all  internal  road  improvements  prior  to  1785  in  Virginia  had  been 
confined  to  improving  Indian  trails,  joining  new  settlements  to  their  neighbors.  or 
turning old  pack-horse  paths into crude wagon  roads  (Netherton  1978:190).  Early 
travel generally was confined  to  the waterways  since the first  settlements had  been 
on the coasts and rivers.  The first  toll road in  the  nation was established in  1785  by 
Virginia  between  Alexandria  and  Snicker'S  Gap  in  Loudoun  County  to  the  north 
(ibid.) .  Local  residents relied on  the  importance of roads for better communication 
with farmlands and the wharves and docks in coastal towns. 

'See Beginning III a white Oak. .. Patents and Northern  Neck  Grants of Fairfax County, 
Virginia,  pages  41-42  for  a  discussion  of  this  parcel  and  the  disputes  concerning 
ownership in the eighteenth century.

In  1795,  the  "Company  of  the  Fairfax  and  Loudoun  Turnpike  Road"  was 
created.  This road became known  as, and  remains, Little River Turnpike, except in 
Alexandri~ where  it  retains  its  eighteenth  century  name,  Duke  Street.  This  road 
was  completed from  the waterfront to  tbe  Little River  in  Aldie  by  1806,  a distance 
of thirty four miles. 

The project area was  outside the  original  bounds  of the  town of Alexandria 
and  remained  marginal  to  the  early  development  that  occurred  closer  to  the 
waterfront.  Development did  occur,  however,  along Little  River Turnpike, as weU 
as  close  to  Great  Hunting  Creek  and  its  tributaries.  Little  River Turnpike  was  a 
main  transportation  artery  leading  to  the  rich  fanolands  of Fairfax  and  Loudoun 
counties.  This road also oonnected with the main north-south post road, making it a 
key to the wharves, warehouses, goods and services of Alexandria.  Thus the site was 
at the hub of an important road network, available for development at an opportune 
time. 

Subdivision of the original Carr and  Simpson plat occurred at  the same  time 
as  oonstruction of little River Turnpike, probably  reflecting the anticipated growtb 
and eoonomic opportunities facilitated by the improved roadway.  Alexandrians and 
Fairfax County residents invested heavily in development projects of this type during 
the last decade of the ei&hteenth century and early nineteenth century.  Adjacent to 
the new roads were new mdustrial developments, mcluding mills and distilleries. 

The  pro~ect area  generally  was  known  as  the  "Bloxham  lot" or  "Bloxham 
boardyard", dunng the first half of the nineteenth century.  little is known about this 
family  at  this  time,  althou~h Elizabeth  Bloxham,  steamstress,  is  listed  in  the  1810 
Alexandria tax list as  residmg at Princess and St. Asaph Streets, with  two whites and 
two  slaves_  This  may be  the  same  Elizabeth Bloxham  who  was  the wife  of James 
Bloxham, fust purchaser of the  40 acre  parcel.  Elizabeth inherited the parcel from 
her husband in 1858. 

During the  same period,  two  mills were  established immediately adjacent to 
the project area, on the cast and west.  These were  lar&e merchant mills, serving the 
needs of farmers who  needed their grain processed pnor to selling it to the  dealers 
along  the  Alexandria waterfront.  South  of the  project  area was  a  distillery,  and 
between the two mills ran a miU  race, part of which traversed the project area.  The 
location  of the  miU  race  is  illustrated  on  several  maps  of the period, as  well  as  in 
deeds  (Fairfax  County Deed  G4/191).No  information  has  yet  been  located  which 
would  clarify  use  of  the  project  area  during  this  period,  although  residences  and 
businesses lined little River Turnpike immedeiately to the north (Figure 4) .. 

A major  change  occurred  in  the  project  area  in  1850  when  the  Orange  and 
Alexandria  Railroad  purchased  a  right-of-way  for  the  rail  line  through  Bloxham's 
property.  At the time, Richard Windsor was listed as tenant.  Soon afterward,  with 
James  Bloxham'S  death,  the  40  acre  parcel,  along  with  other  lands  were  sold  by 
public auction.  The property was described in the newspaper advertisements as

and a lot of about TEN and a HALF ACRES OF lAND aD the said road, very  ncar 
said  gate,  aud  opposite  the  land  of Jobo  H.  Taylor.  One  quarter  aae  in  this  lot  is 
reserved for  the grave-yard,  with  the  right  of egress  and  ingress thercto .... (Alwzndria 
G"""~ Ftbnltvy Jq  J86iJ) 

This  is  tbe  first  reference  located  to  the  graveyard  on tbe  property,  whicb 
subsequently  became  part  of the  land  record  until  the  present  time.  It could  be 
assumed that since rights of ingress and egress are retained relative to the graveyard 
that it was used by Bloxham family members after their purcbase of the property in 
1795. 

During  tbe  lauer  balf  of  tbe  nineteentb  century,  descendants  of  James 
Bloxham  transferred  their  rigbts  to  tbe  project  area  to  various  individuals,  in 
addition to the above mentioned ten acres whicb was purchased by Rozier Catts. 

The Bloxham family  name  does  not  appear regularly in  Alexandria records, 
although the  1870  City  Directory  lists  John T.  Bloxam,  clerk,  who  boarded  in  the 
west end.  A Jobn Bloxham is listed in tbe 1888 Alexandria Directory, and numerous 
land  transactions  are found within  tbe  Fairfax County  land records  concerning tbe 
family. 

The various owners of this period sold  rights-of·way to the various railroads 
for  their tracks  which  now  form  the  bulk  of the  project  area.  In 1920,  the  Fruit 
Grower's Express was organized,  and in 1926 they  moved  their sbop facilities from 
the Potomac Yards north of Alexandria to  a new  location near AF Tower which  is 
south of Duke Street on the RF&P mainline.

VII.  ARCHITECfURAL DESCRIPTION 

Fruit Growers Express  used  the  project site  from  1926  to  1986, as shops  for 
the  building  and  repair  of  refrigerated  railroad  freight  cars.  Railroad  tracks  run 
east·west  through  the  long  rectan~lar site.  Most  of  the  area  is  covered  with 
concrete slab, much disturbed, and 11  is obvious  that additional  buildings were once 
located  on  the  site.  Much  trackage  seems  also  to  have  been  removed,  probably 
including some once providin~ rail access to the repair shops.  Most of the surviving 
structures  were  probably  buIlt  after  1926,  when  Fruit  Growers  moved  its  shop 
facilities  from  nearby Potomac Yard.  Some, particularly the  frame structures,  may 
predate that period.  One, Building  I, is  constructed of cast stone,  a  material  used 
for  only  a  short  time  at  around  the  time  of the  First  World  War  and  generally 
replaced by  concrete block  by  the  1920s.  The extremely large,  and probably early, 
Quonset hut (Building 5) might be significant because of its  date.  It and  the other 
buildings  have  lost  mucb  of  their  integrity,  however,  through  alteration  or 
dilapidation; most are in very bad condition. 

Buildioi  1 (Plate  1):  This  rectangular  building,  measuring  180  feet  by  25 
feet,  stands  00  a  concrete  slab  and  bas  a  sbed  roof  sloping  to  the  north.  The 
construction  material  is  bollow  blocks  of what  was  usually  called  "cast  stone,"  a 
popular building  material  early  in  the  twentieth  century,  both  for  residential  and 
mdustrial  structures.  A  painted  sign  identifies  the  building  as  the  "Shop  Office." 
There are high,  double freight  doors, sliding on an overhead  track, in the center of 
the south elevation, with a  row of fourteen  metal sasb,  three light windows  high on 
the wall  above  them.  Other  openinj!'!  contain  single  metal  pedestrian  doors  and 
small  metal sash  windows.  A  tall bnck chimney abuts tbe northeast corner of the 
building. 

Buildini  2  (Plate  2):  This  rectangular,  one  story,  building,  measuring 
approximately 80 by 30 feet, is  constructed of concrete.  The gable roof, oriented in 
an  east west  direction,  is  covered  in  corrugated  metal,  and  the  gable  ends  of the 
building  itself are  sheathed in metal  panels. 
The west  part  of the  building  is  in 
ruins.  Fenestration on tbe east  half consists of six  light  steel sash  factory windows. 
There is  a  sio~e pedestrian door in  the center of tbe east elevation, with  a  narrow 
ventilator in tlie gable above  it.  A slender brick chimney rises from  the south edge 
of tbe roof near the center of the building. 

Buildioi 3 (Plate 3):  This rectangular, one story, building measures 100 feet 
long  and  35  feet  wide  and  closely  resembles  Building  2,  with  its  gable  roof  also 
running east/west.  It is,  bowever, of wood construction, with a shingle roof and  6/6 
light double  hung wood  sash windows,  probably indicating a somewhat earlier date 
of construction.  Four round ventilators are aligned along the ridgeline of the roof. 

Buildioi  4  (Plate  4): 

This  rectangular  one  story  frame  building, 
approximately  the  same  size  as  Buildin~  3,  shows  evidence  of  considerable 
alteration,  as  well  as  severe  deterioratIOn.  The  concrete  foundation  rises 
approximately two feet  to  form  the lower sills of the  8/8 light double hung wooden 
sash windows in the eastern half of the bUilding.  The windows of the western part of 
the  building  are  taller.  The  gable  roof,  covered  in  tar paper  and  with  a  monitor 
located over its west half, rises approximately tweoty feet above the ground.  A large 
door on  thO  east  provides  rail  car  access  to  what  was  presumably  a  repair  shop. 
There is  a single fIXed  12  light wood sash window under the gable over the car door. 
Two small flat roofed sheds, in even worse condition than the main building, are

located to the south.  On the interior, wood cross bracing provides added support for 
the roof. 

Buildine 5 (Plate 5):  One of two corrugated metal Quonset huts surviving on 
the  site,  this  400  foot  long  structure  is  io  reasonably  good  condition.  The  round 
arched  metal  frame  of  the  building  rests  on  a  two  foot  high  concrete  block 
foundation,  with  a  concrete  slab  floor.  There  are  four  high  shed  roofed  bays 
projecting from the south elevation.  The two in the center have metal freight doors; 
the  two  at  the  ends  have  a  variety  of small  windows.  Six  light  steel  sash  factory 
windows line  the walls  between the doors,  and  a variety of ventilators project from 
the roof.  The  interior is  divided by  partitions into  a number of spaces.  There are 
full  height sliding metal doors on the wes~ possibly once providing access for freight 
cars from  the concrete aproo on that end of the building; there are no doors on the 
east. 

Buildin.& 6 (Plate 6):  This steel framed  building on a four foot hijlh  concrete 
block foundatIon  15  sheathed  in  corrugated  metal.  Measuring  apprOlumately  300 
feet by 60 feet,  the structure has a gable roof running east-west.  HIgh  sliding metal 
freight doors provide rail car access  on a single  through track  set into the  concrete 
floor.  There  are  additional  freight  doors  on  all  elevations.  The  interior  of  the 
building  is  lit  with  large  12  light  steel  sash  awning  windows  and  by  translucent 
skylights.  Two sman flat-roofed  corrugated metal rooms have been built inside the 
building against its north wall. 

Buildinfi 6a (Plate 7):  This metal paneled structure with a flat roof is located 
to tbe east of  uilding 6.  It measures approximately 20  by 30 feet, with fire  doors 
and windows on tbe nortb. 

Buildine 7 (Plate 8):  Two tracks originally provided rail  access  through  this 
relatively  recent  flat  roofed  concrete  block  building  set  on  a  concrete  slab.  Tall 
sliding metal freight doors are located on tbe east and west elevations.  There are no 
windows  on  the  nortb  and  south,  only  ventilators.  What  appears  to  be  washing 
equipment is still extant on the interior. 

Buildine  8  (Plate  9):  Only  a  small  section,  in  very  deteriorated  condition, 
remains of this extremely 10oJ!. corrugated metal Quonset hut.  To the east and west, 
the only  evidence of tbe origInal  675  foot  length of the building  is  provided by  the 
double row of concrete piers which once provided support for the arched roof (Plate 
10).  Both of the arched metal structures on this site rested on relatively permanent 
concrete support structures, unusual  for Quonset huts.  Three tracks seem originally 
to  have  run  through  the  building,  again  presumably  providing  access  for  the 
refrigerated  cars  whicb  were  serviced  on  the  site.  A  sign  painted  on  the  north, 
facing the entrance road, identifies the site with Fruit Growers Express. 

Buildine  9  (Plate  11):  This  15  by  30  foot  one  story  wood  frame  guard 
house/office  has  a  standing  seam  metal  gable  roof running  east/west.  There  are 
6/6 light double hung wood sash windows on the north, east and south elevations.  A 
wood paneled door and small observation window are located on the west facing the 
access road. 

Buildine  10 (Plate  12):  This small  square  one  story  pump  house  is  built  of 
concrete  block,  but  with  wooden  roof  rafters,  wooden  doors,  and  wooden  sash 
double  hung  windows.  The  top  of  the  concrete  wall  is  ridged,  presumably  to 
accommodate the original corrugated metal  roof (no longer extant).

Because of the removal of previously emtine structures and railroad  tracks, 
and the deteriorated condition of most of the survivmg buildings, the Fruit Growers

EVALUATION OF RESEARCH 

A. 

Prehistoric 

An  assessment  of  prehistoric  site  potential  is  based  on  the  previous 
archaeological  investigations  of  nearby  sites,  the  prehistoric  background  of  the 
project  area  and  archaeological  studies  conducted  in  the  general  vicinity  of 
Alexandria.  Locations  at  the  confluences  of  streams,  near  springs  and  in  well 
drained  areas  of  low  relief  as  well  as  drier  elevations  above  water  sources  are 
suggested to have high archaeological potential. 

Considering the environmental  parameters of prehistoric sites  as  located  in 
previous  studies  and  noted  in  the  prehistoric  background  the  potential  for 
Identifying sites ranging from  the ArchaIc to Woodland  periods is medIUm to high in 
the project area.  Barnard's Map of the Environs of Washington from  1865 shows  a 
stream  extending  almost  directly  north  from  the  Mill  Race  which  is  along  the 
southern  boundary  of the  project  area  (Figure  4).  This  stream  is  shown  running 
through the site in the eastern section of the project area.  This small stream is also 
mentioned in  the seventeenth and eighteenth  century deeds.  Also  on the Barnard 
map, a confluence of two streams is ShOwn in the western section of the project area. 
A)!ain  the  stream extends  north·northeast  from  the millrace.  During the years  of 
ratlroad  construction  it  is  evident  that  the  streams  have  been  filled  in.  The 
immediate  area  surrounding  these  streambeds  is  of  high  prehistoric potential  for 
both temporary and  longterm campsites,  as well  as  possible  resource  procurement 
areas. 

B. 

Historic 

The  assessment  of historic  archaeological  site  potential  within  the  project 
area  is  based  upon  documentary  resources  and  previous  archaeological  studies 
within  the  general  vicinity  of Alexandria.  As  in  the  prediction  of  locations  for 
prehistoric sites certaio environmental variables are considered.  These include the 
proximity  of water  resources,  elevation  and  the  proximity  to  navigable  water  and 
other transportation modes. 

Documentary  sources  have  indicated  that  there  were  residences  on  the 
property  dating  from  the  early  nineteenth  century.  The property  may  have  been 
settled as  early as the late  seventeenth century, although  no  documentary evidence 
has been  located that would  indicate  where early tenants of the earr and Simpson 
patent  located  dwellings  or  other structures.  Settlements  of this  period  are  often 
close to navigable water on well drained soil. 

lt is clear that there was a residence in the vicinity of the project area by the 
middle of the nineteenth century.  The advertisement from the Alexandria Gazette 
for  the  sale  of  the  Bloxham  prope~ mentions  a  house  being  on  the  property 
(Alexandria  Gazette  ]86(J).  The  Hopkins  map  of 1894  (Figure 6) shows  residences 
and stores along the Little River Turnpike but these area too far  north to be within 
the  project  area.  These  structures  are  also  shown  on  a  Plat  Map  from  the  1901 
court  case  between  Peter  H.  Watkins  and  Winfield  B.  Watkins  10  which  George 
Watkins was deeded the portion of property containing the cemetery.  The cemetery 
is known to exist within the project area. 

. 
27 

The Hopkins map of 1894 (Figure 6) shows  a mill  race on the southern part

Beginning in the  middle of the  nineteenth century railroad tracks were  laid across 
the southern portion of -the project area.  As the railroads expanded the number of 
tracks and therefore the  number and  size of the easements increased.  In 1926 the 
Fruit  Growers  Exchange  purchased  a  number  of  parcels  and  the  project  area 
became  a  freight  center.  The  area  has  maintained  this  transportation  related

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Phase  I  archaeological  testing is  recommended  for  the  Alexandria  Business 
Center project  area.  The  purpose  of the  survey  would  be  to  locate  and  identify 
historic  and  prehistoric sites  through  subsurface  testing.  Specifically,  the  Phase 1 
study sbould aim to: 

1) 

2) 

determine the presence or absence of archaeological  resources within 
the project area. 

interpret  any  identified  sites  for  cultural  affiliation,  size,  function, 
integrity and significance 

3) 

detennine the need for further archaeological study 

The  areas  most  likely  to  contain  prebistoric  sites  are  the  elevations 
overlooking  the  streams.  Since  environmental  conditions  have  cbanged  since  the 
Middle  Arcbaic  Period,  some  of the  property  wbicb  appears  to  be  within  former 
wetlands  may  bave  been drier 8000  years  ago  and  more  conducive  to  settlement. 
The  areas  containing  the  highest  potential  for  historic  resources  are  those  areas 
dosest to the roads and outside the project area, and along the streams.  The central 
portion of the project area is  most likely  to contain railroad related  structures and 
artifacts.  There is a possibility, however, that historic features will be present within 
the central  portion of the site  which have  not been documented in sources  located 
for the present study. 

The testing l'rogram should  consist of a selective examination of the project 
area with priority gIVen to the areas of highest potential for archaeological remains. 
Mechanical  excavation  is  recommended  for  the  removal  of  fill  and  modem 
structural  features.  This  would  be  followed  by  hand  excavated  test  units  and  the 
excavation of deep test trenches.
