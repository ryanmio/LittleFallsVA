 The Housing Stock of
 the Early United States:

 Refinement Meets Migration

 Carole Shammas

 I have been at a fine plantation called Hunthill belonging to Mr
 Rutherfurd. On this he has a vast number of Negroes employed
 . . . He makes a great deal of tar and turpentine, but his great
 work is a saw-mill . . . There is a show of plenty . . . but it is a
 mere plantation . . . they keep a good house, tho' it is little bet
 ter than one of his Negro huts, and it appeared droll enough to
 eat out of China and be served in plate in such a parlour . . .
 Every body agrees that it [the plantation] is able to draw from
 twelve to fifteen hundred a year sterling money.

 A common theme running through the accounts of British and
 European travelers to the colonized portions of North America is
 the disjuncture they observed between colonists' material wealth
 and the shoddiness of their built environment. Janet Schaw's 1775 journal

 entry furnishes a good illustration. The author was a well-off Scottish
 woman paying a visit to her brother, who had earlier immigrated to
 North Carolina. Schaw clearly admired the colony's natural beauty, the
 wealth being extracted from the forest, and even her host's consumer
 durables. What mystified her, however, was the indifference of these
 affluent colonists to the erection and preservation of proper housing.
 Buildings appropriate to a colonist's social and economic standing,
 according to her account, remained forever in the planning stage, stood
 half unfinished for years, or, if finally constructed, often burned down
 because no one made any serious attempt at firefighting.

 Only in the last few years have historians of early America directed
 their attention to what eighteenth-century commentators considered
 good housing and when and why different segments of society began to
 invest in it. Important work on vernacular architecture had appeared
 earlier, but it had primarily focused on another issue, regional differ
 ence. Researchers, relying on evidence from surviving structures,
 devoted themselves to matching different types of construction?New
 England timber frame, mid-Atlantic stone, Georgian brick of the
 Chesapeake, Appalachian log?to the ethnic traditions of Atlantic
 immigrants and to tracing the evolution of their building techniques
 and styles as they confronted the challenges of the American environ
 ment. Though of great use to those interested in the transmission of cul
 ture and folkways, this literature posed a formidable barrier to the
 integration of research on the built environment with nonregional
 themes in early American history and to the incorporation of colonial
 structures into the history of housing and building in the United States.
 For these reasons historians of colonial America and the United States

 have enthusiastically greeted the argument that a new linkage of social
 status with civility, refinement, and comfort gradually worked its way
 down the social ladder and resulted in an improved domestic environ
 ment from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the first half of
 the nineteenth century, including what contemporaries considered more
 permanent and well-built dwellings. The titles and subtitles of various
 works suggest a major architectural change: The Refinement of America-,
 "The Transformation of Living Standards in Early America"; The
 Invention of Comfort, and Beauty and Convenience: Architecture and Order
 in the New Republic.1

 2 The most notable exception to my generalization about the recent vintage of

 research on colonial housing standards is Cary Carson et al., "Impermanent
 Architecture in the Southern American Colonies," Winterthur Portfolio 16, nos. 2-3
 (Summer-Autumn 1981): 135-96. Some of the most important work on regional dif
 ference is found in Henry Glassie, Pattern in the Material Folk Culture of the Eastern
 United States (Philadelphia, 1968); Abbott Lowell Cummings, The Framed Houses of

 HOUSING STOCK OF THE EARLY UNITED STATES 551

 A long-standing movement for housing improvement across the

 Atlantic appears to have inspired this American transformation.
 England's rebuilding process, according to historians of the Tudor and
 Stuart periods, began in the sixteenth century when people evicted live
 stock from quarters adjoining houses, replaced earthen floors with
 wood, substituted fireplaces and chimneys for open hearths and holes in
 roofs, floored over halls to create full second stories, and glazed win
 dows. In the later seventeenth century, especially after the Great Fire of
 London, wood and clay construction fell into disrepute while brick and
 stone became preferred housing materials. Multilevel, compact, and uni
 form row houses began replacing the jumbled lanes of timber-framed
 dwellings in English cities and country towns.3 Brick for permanence,
 second stories for space, fireplaces and glazed windows for warmth and
 light, and Georgian or, later, neoclassic facades for symmetry were all
 part of the program.

 Colonial Americans had internalized many of these ideals at least as

 far back as 1728, when William Byrd of Westover chided North

 Massachusetts Bay, 1625-1725 (Cambridge, Mass., 1979); Allen G. Noble, Wood, Brick,
 and Stone: The North American Settlement Landscape, vol. 1, Houses (Amherst, Mass.,
 1984). David Hackett Fischer makes good use of this regional vernacular literature
 for the colonies and England in Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in
 America (New York, 1989). Carson has also noted the historiographical neglect of
 the regional vernacular literature but views the problem from another perspective in
 Carson, "Material Culture History: The Scholarship Nobody Knows," in American
 Material Culture: The Shape of the Field, ed. Ann Smart Martin and J. Ritchie
 Garrison (Knoxville, Tenn., 1997), 401-28. Richard L. Bushman develops the idea of
 a transformation most fully. See Bushman, The Refinement of America: Persons,
 Houses, Cities (New York, 1992). Edward A. Chappell supplies the best coverage of
 the literature. See Chappell, "Housing a Nation: The Transformation of Living
 Standards in Early America," in Of Consuming Interests: The Style of Life in the
 Eighteenth Century, ed. Carson, Ronald Hoffman, and Peter J. Albert
 (Charlottesville, Va., 1994), 167-232. John E. Crowley furnishes an excellent account
 of the search for warmth and light. See Crowley, The Invention of Comfort:
 Sensibilities and Design in Early Modern Britain and Early America (Baltimore, 2001).
 Nora Pat Small brings in conflicting notions of improvement in the early national
 Massachusetts countryside. See Small, Beauty and Convenience: Architecture and
 Order in the New Republic (Knoxville, Tenn., 2003).

 Carolinians about their chimneyless log dwellings. After independence,
 as leaders of the early United States began to review what they had
 fought over and what they were going to do with it, the critiques grew
 more serious. Thomas Jefferson's famous dictum that building in wood
 doomed a society to a complete rebuilding every fifty years is one exam
 ple. Virginians had to use more "durable" materials, in his view, so that
 every new structure would be "an actual and permanent acquisition to
 the state." A contributor to the American Museum, a leading magazine of
 the period, put it more personally. "Those who have either children or a
 wife to leave behind them will build of brick," he advised, "if they wish
 to leave monuments of kindness, rather than a rent-charge, behind
 them."4 More conclusively, the 1798 direct federal tax enumerators
 received specific instructions for assessing private dwellings. To deter
 mine a dwelling's valuation, the government instructed these men to
 consider not only the structure's state of repair and square footage but
 also the type of construction (brick, stone, or wood), number of stories,
 and number of glazed windows and panes. These housing characteristics
 correlate closely with the rebuilding agenda observed in England and
 elsewhere in western Europe during the early modern period.

 But questions remain. The authors of this refinement thesis are
 themselves tentative about the chronology. A close reading of texts on
 the increasing refinement, comfort, and symmetry of early American
 dwellings indicates a belief on the part of the writers that a transforma
 tion was underway, yet they make no firm assertions about the depth of
 enthusiasm for rebuilding as the eighteenth century gave way to the
 nineteenth. Also throwing something of a wet blanket over this transfor
 mation are the implications of studies on the explosive growth of the
 backcountry from 1760 through the 1840s. Historians depict an America
 rapidly moving away from domestic improvement, comfort, and refine
 ment toward a ruder lifestyle. Travelers' accounts after the Revolution by
 Europeans, easterners, and some settlers vividly describe the miserable
 living conditions of those who relocated to better their prospects: small,
 chimneyless, windowless, earthen-floor, vermin-infested log shacks.

 of horizontal log construction, Donald A. Hutslar nonetheless labels it
 the "architecture of migration."5 Such architecture challenges the refine
 ment thesis and its effect on the total housing stock.

 Nor does the refinement thesis really resolve more satisfactorily than
 the earlier regional approach how the early American housing stock
 influenced nineteenth-century housing trends. In the past general histo
 ries of housing in the United States included a chapter or two on
 regional types as a prologue to the real action that began after 1830,
 when modern forms overthrew traditional ones. Unfortunately, the story
 of trickle-down refinement, in which respectable middle-class society
 adapted genteel transatlantic building practices and set the norm for the
 rest of the population, does not lead any more logically to how houses
 came to be built. Standardized light-frame construction is credited
 almost universally with "radically" transforming home building in the
 United States, and its emergence coincided with the appearance of

 5 Donald A. Hutslar, Log Construction in the Ohio Country, 1750?1850 (Athens,

 Ohio, 1992), is an abridged ed. of Hutslar, The Architecture of Migration: Log
 Construction in the Ohio Country, 1750?1850 (Athens, Ohio, 1986). On the tentative
 ness of the chronology, Rhys Isaac writes, "Change was slow in coming to the
 dwellings of poor planters, who continued to live crowded in one-room or two
 room houses until well into the nineteenth century" (Isaac, Transformation of Virginia,
 305). Richard L. Bushman divides Refinement of America into two parts; the first is
 1700-1790, which concerns increased investment in housing by elites on the eastern
 seaboard. The second part, 1790-1850, is the spread of refinement promised in the
 title, which almost exclusively concerns buildings, images, and writings after 1830
 directed at the middle classes. At the end of his long review essay, Edward A. Chappell
 concludes that "even with the increasing consumerism of the early republic, change in
 quality of housing did not parallel the apparent rise in people's ability and desire to
 obtain lesser goods. Early American consumers may have lined up for fine earthen
 wares . . . but not for new housing" (Chappell, "Housing a Nation," 232). John E.
 Crowley maintains that a domestic comfort revolution took place in eighteenth
 century Britain and America but did not affect that many people: "The priority of
 housing in household consumption had increased but still remained generally low:
 'most Americans were still living in small, mean, vernacular houses' ... In the early
 nineteenth century, household comfort had not yet become so popular as the display
 of refinement and gentility" (Crowley, Invention of Comfort, 262). Nora Pat Small
 writes that "in the half-century following the American Revolution rural New
 Englanders transformed their built environment . . . The rebuilding is undeniable, but
 its overall effect on housing in the new republic can be overstated if we forget how
 much poor and substandard housing remained" (Small, Beauty and Convenience,
 xiii-xiv). On the growth of the backcountry, see Richard R. Beeman, The Evolution of
 the Southern Backcountry: A Case Study of Lunenburg County, Virginia, 1746-1832

 architectural pattern books featuring a wide variety of exterior and inte
 rior styles for national consumption. Home construction in new areas
 such as the Midwest deviated from that in the refinement literature.

 Wood eclipsed brick and stone, and the wood that triumphed was not
 the mortise-and-tenon timber frame of New England but types more
 quickly assembled with two-by-four pieces of lumber and nails.
 Carpenters and contractors erected dwellings with a simplified frame,
 requiring less artisanal expertise and allowing for lower labor costs.
 Making the construction even more efficient, cast-iron stoves replaced
 masonry hearths and in some cases chimneys disappeared as well. This
 light-frame architecture conquered all classes in the United States and
 remains the principal method for constructing homes today.6

 Problems of representativeness and chronology highlight the importance
 of knowing more precisely the characteristics of the early American
 housing stock; the 1798 direct tax lists are a good place to start. These

 6 Gwendolyn Wright, Building the Dream: A Social History of Housing in
 America (New York, 1981), 87 (quotation). Rather than having suddenly emerged in
 Chicago in the 1830s, cost-effective light-frame construction is now seen as having
 evolved more gradually during the preceding four decades. This gradual evolution of
 frame building techniques actually made the houses more cost effective from at
 least the 1790s. A building boom in the Midwest from the 1830s drew attention to
 the new kinds of construction techniques available. On standardized light-frame
 architecture, see Carl W. Condit, American Building: Materials and Techniques from

 lists, which represent the fullest enumeration of buildings in the United
 States until the Census Bureau incorporated housing questions into the
 decennial tally in 1940, offer information about typical housing in the
 last third of the refinement process, from 1790 to 1850. Economic histo
 rian Lee Soltow, the first to analyze the 1798 direct tax summary lists,
 discovered that assessors had deemed slightly more than half the housing
 in the new nation of insufficient value to be taxed. His analysis, how
 ever, did not include a full survey of what kind of housing the dwelling
 values represented. That type of information is available for thousands
 of houses in different regions of the country in the 1798 direct tax par
 ticular lists. Before and since Soltow's book, numerous local studies

 drawing on these lists have appeared, yet making statements about the
 United States as a whole from these individual studies remains difficult.

 One researcher finds a township's residential stock made up almost
 exclusively of small log dwellings with no amenities, whereas another
 investigating other communities in the same state discovers that two
 story stone and brick structures constitute a substantial proportion of
 the housing.7 In coordination with direct tax particular lists, scholars
 should also consult census data from 1800 to try to determine how
 important brick buildings in cities were to largely rural America, how
 much of the population actually lived in log cabins on the sparsely set
 tled frontier, what fell between these extremes, and how populous the
 regions with varying housing types were.

 The tax lists and other sources not only supply an early benchmark
 for the housing stock of the nation but also clarify the relationship
 between the built environment and broader trends in early American
 history, specifically the rapid migration and high fertility rates of the
 population from the last third of the eighteenth century to the early
 decades of the nineteenth century. These population movements appear
 to be associated with the demand for low-cost construction, principally
 of log, that dominated the landscape and stood as a major obstacle to

 any widespread rebuilding along the lines laid out in the prescriptive lit
 erature or observed in urban centers. After 1830 the gradual takeover of
 the mass market by professionally built, less expensive light-frame archi
 tecture in town and country coincided with a drop in the rate of new
 land being settled, a rise in urbanization rates, and a decline in fertility
 rates. Evidence of changes in the housing stock from later censuses fur
 ther supports this argument. Though the widespread commitment to
 permanence in the housing stock had finally materialized, it was not
 exactly the kind of rebuilding eighteenth-century proponents had
 envisioned.

 This analysis begins with a state-by-state overview of the percentage
 of 1798 dwellings valued at $100 or less by enumerators and thus exempt
 from taxation (Table I). These dwellings, which constituted half the
 housing stock on the tax list, were too substandard or hastily con
 structed to last or in such hopeless disrepair that they would or should
 be replaced. They could be log cabins erected as temporary dwellings,
 log houses intended for longer use but likely to be replaced when cir
 cumstances allowed, or more substantial timber-frame or even brick
 buildings that had been damaged or neglected. The government's
 exemption of these houses from taxation meant it did not consider them
 as capital but impermanent.8

 The housing stock of states with a large part of their population liv
 ing in areas settled in the last half of the eighteenth century had the
 highest proportion of impermanent, low-valued housing; a North-South
 difference also existed. The long-settled regions of New England came
 out the best and the southern frontier states the worst. As high as the
 number of nontaxable dwellings was, the actual proportion of housing at
 risk to fall down or constructed with the intention of rebuilding proba
 bly exceeded it. The direct tax omits the housing of Indian nations liv
 ing within the boundaries claimed by the United States and does not
 include the living quarters of slave households as dwellings. It is also
 likely that the 18 percent of housing that appeared in the lowest taxable
 category ($101-99) contained some structures barely distinguishable
 from their untaxed brethren. Only the higher value of land or particu
 larly numerous domestic outbuildings, which were included in the valu
 ation of houses, boosted them into the taxable category. Thus the actual
 proportion of impermanent dwellings falls somewhere within the 59 to

 8 Stone, brick, and timber-frame dwellings with brick chimneys and founda

 tions that were not dilapidated were valued at more than $100 and seemingly quali
 fied as permanent. Log cabins and one-story wooden dwellings of less than six
 hundred square feet with few or no glass windows usually fell into the nontaxable
 category.

 Notes: I only altered one estimate, that for total number of houses in Vermont,

 which seemed excessively large. I substituted a number that projected a 60 percent
 nontaxable, based on the 54 percent nontaxable in neighboring New York, which in
 some upstate areas had comparable housing to Vermont but also had a major urban
 center that would have brought evaluations higher than Vermont's at the time.
 Checking Soltow's estimates against the results from states that have complete or
 nearly complete general lists (Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania), the
 proportions are off no more than 1 percent.

 74 percent range. As a point of comparison, the U.S. government today
 classifies only about 12 percent of dwellings as being impermanent or in
 bad repair.9

 9 Included in the valuation of dwellings were domestic outbuildings. In some
 cases in the South, structures were specifically designated "Negro houses," but more
 often the outbuildings included in this category were named for their work func
 tions: kitchens, washhouses, milk houses. They may nevertheless have housed slaves.
 The numbers of impermanent houses are based on an estimation that 100,000
 Indians and 576,798 slaves (6y percent of the slave population) lived in impermanent

 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY

 It is possible to map intrastate variations by focusing on jurisdic

 tions where detailed data exist for all or large portions of the state.
 Prime examples (from lowest to highest proportion of untaxed
 dwellings) are Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maine, and Maryland. The
 main early American folk housing traditions?those of New England,
 the mid-Atlantic, and the Chesapeake?are represented by structures in
 these states.10

 Massachusetts had the lowest proportion of untaxed dwellings in the
 United States (see Table I). Its most highly valued housing was along the
 Atlantic seaboard; moving inland, the percentage of townships with
 nontaxable housing stock rose noticeably (Figure I).11 In Pennsylvania
 the contrast shows up even more vividly: the valuations in long
 established southeastern portions of the state far eclipsed townships to
 the west and north (Figure II). The western half of Pennsylvania had
 many townships in which more than 75 percent of the dwellings were
 valued at $100 or less, whereas in Massachusetts only a single township
 in the western part of the state had such a high proportion of poor hous
 ing. Southeastern Pennsylvania, though, exhibited a record as good as or
 better than eastern Massachusetts. What may be surprising to some is
 the significant portion of Pennsylvania that was either sparsely settled or
 lacked any known Euro-American habitations at the end of the eigh
 teenth century.

 Maine had served as a frontier for Massachusetts since the mid

 seventeenth century, but wars kept erasing settlements. At the conclu
 sion of the Seven Years' War in 1765, the area had about twenty

 dwellings in the United States not counted in the direct tax. Assuming a household
 size of 5.5 people, the 127,038 dwellings represent 18 percent of the housing stock.
 Table I shows that 50 percent of the remaining 82 percent of the housing stock, or
 41 percent, is untaxed and thus impermanent. Adding 18 percent to 41 percent equals
 59 percent impermanent dwellings. In addition to this 59 percent, some of the
 houses valued from $101 to $199 were impermanent. The houses that fell into this
 category were, coincidently, 18 percent of the 82 percent of all houses taxed, which
 could increase the 59 percent of impermanent houses by o percent if none were
 impermanent and raise it to 74 percent if all were impermanent. The current-day
 percentage comes from the American Housing Survey for the United States: 2003,
 http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/ahs/ahso3/tab22.htm. Impermanence was
 associated with manufactured/mobile homes and those units identified as having
 severe or moderate physical problems. They totaled 13,144 out of the 105,842 occu
 pied units in the survey.

 American Geographers 55, no. 4 (December 1965): 549?77.

 11 It is useful to remember that a twp. is an administrative unit, not a town or a
 city. Several hamlets, villages, towns, or even boroughs could coexist in one twp.
 Twps. could also be completely rural.

 thousand inhabitants squeezed into less than twenty-five hundred
 houses.12 During the next thirty-five years, with the French threat
 removed, Maine experienced the most significant in-migration in its his
 tory. By 1800 the population had soared to more than one hundred fifty
 thousand. Even after this influx, however, about 85 percent of the state
 remained unpopulated and much of the new housing was of the imper
 manent variety (Figure III). Only a few townships along the coast had 25
 percent or less nontaxable housing.

 Maryland presents a somewhat different situation. This state, which
 originally based its economy on tobacco, never had much of a back
 country, and whatever western parts Maryland possessed are not among
 those counties whose tax records survive. The Eastern Shore and the

 western side of the tidewater, however, are well represented (Figure IV).
 Southern states used the hundred, or parish, designation rather than
 township for administrative purposes and the exact boundaries for these
 jurisdictions are unknown. Consequently, data are available at the
 county level. All Maryland counties had more than 25 percent of their
 dwellings valued at $100 or less, and most had from 51 to 75 percent in
 that category. Rather than an east-west contrast, the only observable
 division was between buildings in northern and southern Maryland. The
 northern counties, nearer the Pennsylvania border, possessed the better
 housing, despite the fact that Baltimore and Harford counties were set
 tled later than the other counties whose records survived. In the case of

 Baltimore County, the presence of the city influenced the ranking
 greatly; without Baltimore, the county would have been at the 51-75 per
 cent nontaxable level. Harford County possessed no important urban
 center. That northern Maryland housing was superior to southern is in
 keeping with the theory that impermanent housing existed longer in
 areas that continued to concentrate on tobacco cultivation rather than

 crop diversification.13

 The geographic size of the areas with poor or impermanent housing
 was large (see Figures I?IV). Some of this land had just been settled, but
 other territory had been inhabited for a generation and some communi
 ties dated back to the seventeenth century. Moreover the numbers living
 in recently settled (post-1765) areas had skyrocketed to 36 percent of the
 population of the United States, a greater proportion than those living
 in either the longer-established rural areas of the Northeast or of the
 South.14 Throughout most of the colonial period, almost all colonists

 had lived near the Atlantic coast or the numerous rivers that remained

 navigable fifty or so miles into the interior. Lack of access to markets
 and conflict with Indian nations awaited those who ventured farther.
 After the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, the United
 States citizenry poured into western lands at a faster rate than ever
 before or since.

 In a series of articles published during the past ten years, geographer

 Carville Earle and his associates traced the rate of westward migration
 from 1650 to the end of the nineteenth century. He criticized the per
 ception that settlement of the American continent proceeded at a steady,
 linear rate from colonial times to the 1890s. Instead he drew attention to
 the great contrast between the eighteenth-century rate of geographic
 expansion and the period from 1840 onward, when the rate slowed
 appreciably. In his view the emphasis Frederick Jackson Turner and the
 Census Bureau placed on 1890 as the closing of the frontier missed the
 mark by fifty years. Earle's findings are particularly relevant because of
 the attention he focuses on the rapid square-mile growth of settled areas
 after 1720. His data reveal a sawtooth movement, with accelerated
 expansion during economic recoveries and prosperous times and a drop
 in the rate during economic depressions. Nevertheless, if one adds

 density measures (people per square mile), some long-term patterns
 emerge. Before 1720 and from 1840 to the present, the people-per
 square-mile figure doubled about every fifty years. From 1720 to 1840,
 however, the rate of population increase, which by European standards
 was breaking all records, only slightly exceeded the expansion in square
 miles settled. During that 120-year period, it took 100 years for density
 to double?that is, to go from nine to eighteen people per square
 mile?twice the time required in the earlier and later periods.15 In the
 decades from 1760 to 1780 and 1800 to 1820, internal migration pro
 ceeded at such a fast clip that hardly any increase in density is perceiv
 able. Thus around 1800 frontier areas hardly had time to mature before
 people moved on to new frontiers. Presumably, these territories drew
 settlers at least in part from slightly more mature frontier communities.
 This continual transience may partially explain the large geographic size
 of areas with low-valued housing.

 Up to this point, housing in 1798 has been solely judged by valua
 tions of more or less than $100 without addressing the range of average
 values in communities or what housing characteristics were associated
 with those averages. With federal direct tax particular lists, it is possible
 to link dollar values of houses and respective lots with descriptions. The
 lists relate what contemporaries thought gave greatest value to a house:
 its dimensions, the number of stories, the presence of outbuildings for
 domestic use, the building material, the number of glass windows, and
 its condition. These features coincided closely with the criteria
 embraced by those urging rebuilding of structures according to transat
 lantic standards. Material culture historians, much more interested in
 these data than property valuations, have produced a number of local
 studies of the housing characteristics in communities in Massachusetts,

 that the rate of migration began to decline prior to the Civil War. See Hall and

 square miles for a given year and dividing it into the population figure for that year

 the numbers come from the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United
 States: 2004-2005 (Washington, D.C., 2005), 7 (table 1).

 Pennsylvania, and the Chesapeake.16 This article builds on that research,
 adding new communities and augmenting existing data sets to offer a
 profile of U.S. housing around 1800.

 Chosen locations reflect as much geographic diversity as possible
 without overrepresenting sparsely populated regions (Table II).
 Completeness of reporting explains the selection of one community over
 another in the same area. For some regions, however, no communities
 possessed information on number of windows or dwelling condition.
 The number of observations reflects the proportion of the 1800 popula
 tion living in each settlement category, except that city residences were
 oversampled to capture fully their diversity. Following the Census
 Bureau standard, urban denotes places where twenty-five hundred peo
 ple or more lived and includes not only central wards in three major
 cities of the time but also districts in two provincial cities and an arti
 sanal suburb. Fifty-eight percent of the U.S. population lived in older,
 rural settlements formed prior to the beginning of the westward migra
 tion boom of the mid-i76os. Households had occupied many of these
 rural townships and hundreds much earlier, in the seventeenth or early
 eighteenth centuries. The communities are arranged geographically from
 north to south. The Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania
 townships collectively represent 31 percent of the population in 1800 liv
 ing in the parts of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, southeast
 ern New Hampshire, Hudson River areas of New York, New Jersey,
 eastern Pennsylvania, and Delaware that had been settled by 1765. The
 27 percent of inhabitants living in the established areas of the rural tide
 water and Piedmont?Maryland and the eastern portions of Virginia,
 North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia?are represented by com
 munities in Maryland and Virginia. Finally, newer settlements, meaning
 frontier areas where significant numbers of permanent non-Indian settle
 ments sprang up after 1765, cover Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee,
 and recently formed communities in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, the
 Carolinas, and Georgia. Townships in Maine and New York, communities

 16 Not many enumerators carefully specified condition. Did some assessors mis
 label houses as dilapidated to help neighbors obtain a lower evaluation? Perhaps, but
 the way the tax was levied made that strategy problematic. Taxes could only be pro
 gressive at the state level because the Constitution only allowed the federal govern
 ment to levy taxes on a per-head basis. Each state, required to furnish a set amount
 to the federal government, proceeded to tax according to the value of the property,
 with more valuable dwellings taxed at a higher percentage. If an assessor undervalued
 the dwellings in his district, another district had to make up the difference.
 Reassessments occurred to come up with the full amount owed by the state, but few
 changes were as dramatic as the one for the city of Baltimore, which saw its tax dou
 bled. Most adjustments for rural districts were minor and done for the whole dis
 trict. For local studies of housing characteristics, see Data Sources, 588-90.

 Notes: Values are means unless otherwise indicated. For center city wards, average dwelling-only values were obtained by subtracting the product of average per-square-foot
 value of vacant lots and total square footage of residential lots from the total value of residential property in a ward. For the rest of the samples, dwelling-only values were
 obtained by subtracting the product of the per-acre value of nonresidential property and the total acreage of residential lots from the total value of residential property in a com
 munity. For all urban areas except West Southwark, people per house is based on citywide averages. Values for dwellings worth $100 or less were obtained by regression for
 Berkeley Parish, Champlain, and Shenandoah Valley. The numbers of windows for dwellings worth $100 or less were obtained by regression for Topsfield, Upton, South

 in Pennsylvania, and an estate in the Shenandoah Valley collectively rep
 resent 36 percent of the 1800 population.17

 Arranging the communities by settlement type rather than segregat
 ing them by regions is a departure from usual practice in material cul
 ture studies. Indeed most of the literature on early American housing
 focuses on one region. In grouping by settlement type, the intent is not
 to diminish the significance of regional housing differences. Rather the
 objective is to study both, since it seems apparent that population den
 sity and period of settlement had a big effect on the housing stock apart
 from certain distinctive regional characteristics.

 Housing in metropolitan places, regardless of region, had the high
 est average dollar value, followed by the older settled regions, with loca
 tions in the North often higher in value than those in the South (see
 Table II). The housing of the 36 percent of the population living in
 more recently settled areas lagged far behind; all were assessed at less
 than $101. It is important to look at housing values after deducting the
 price of land. In certain urban areas, for instance the new wharf section
 in Boston's eighth ward, the cost of land made a dramatic difference in
 the value. In other city locations, the value of land was less important,
 and in older small town and rural communities, land costs normally
 represented only from 5 to 15 percent of a residence's total value.

 After subtracting the value of land, the dollar amounts of the struc
 tures themselves in the central wards of the major cities clustered
 around $2,000. In provincial cities the dwellings averaged half as much.
 Urban houses were made of brick and generally bigger due to multiple
 stories. The number of windows also exceeded the totals in most of the

 rural areas despite common walls with neighboring dwellings in center
 cities lowering the available space for such amenities. Cities also had
 their modest housing. As has been pointed out many times by urban
 historians, city neighborhoods in early America were more economically
 diverse than twentieth- and twenty-first-century neighborhoods. But
 cities, unlike anywhere else, had new, multistory brick buildings. Even
 in working-class Southwark, 20 percent of the buildings were masonry

 17 Only four 1798 direct tax particular lists of frontier areas exist for Maine; all

 are from the same area of York Co. Settlements in that co. date back to the seven
 teenth century, but the Parsonsfield area was not developed until after 1760.
 Champlain and the two adjoining twps. are among the few particular lists currently
 known to have survived for New York State. In 1786 sustained settlement in the
 northern Shenandoah Valley had been going on for about a generation (that is,
 thirty-three years), though some small settlements had existed as early as the 1740s.

 (see Table II). Municipal governments and newly formed insurance
 companies worked to make brick the building material of choice for
 safety reasons, and property owners who could afford the change consid
 ered brick buildings more durable and stylish. Even in small interior
 cities such as Lancaster, where log prevailed and where many tradition
 ally looked to stone for permanence, brick gained converts (Figure V).
 Thirty-one percent of the buildings in the northeastern ward were brick,
 12 percent stone, and another 10 percent were a combination of wood
 and brick or stone. Regional differences were not absent: Boston, older
 than the other cities, lagged behind in its rate of conversion, and
 Providence had almost no brick. One of its enumerators, chattier than

 most, wrote of a mansion house "new and elegant, built of wood," a
 comment that would have ranked as a non sequitur in Philadelphia.
 Outside of cities wood reigned supreme. In older settlements the materi
 als of permanence, stone or brick, walled less than 10 percent of homes
 everywhere except in southeastern Pennsylvania, where stone dwellings
 appreciably raised the average value of housing.18

 Wood could mean either frame or log construction or something in
 between. Occasionally, the division between timber-frame and log struc
 tures became blurred because builders attached clapboard onto logs and
 employed some timber-frame building techniques, especially when the
 plans called for an addition or a second story. Mostly, though, the two
 forms were distinct. Frame construction with large timber pieces and
 handcrafted mortise-and-tenon joints as well as a central brick fireplace
 involved more expertise and generally cost more to build. Communities
 founded in the first half of the seventeenth century, including many in
 Massachusetts and the Chesapeake, are associated in the literature with
 frame building and clapboard exteriors, whereas communities in the
 mid-Atlantic, especially those founded by German immigrants in the

 less, but for most of the twps. that proportion was not large. He finds 32 percent
 stone or brick houses, 58 percent built of log, 26 percent with two stories, and an
 average of 6.5 windows per house. Across the Delaware River in New Jersey, one
 finds much less brick and stone but comparable proportions of two-story dwellings.

 the first years of settlement and later hewn logs and daub.19 The 1798
 direct tax lists suggest log had attained a strong foothold in all but the
 older settled regions of New England.

 Harold R. Shurtleff's The Log Cabin Myth successfully alerted histo
 rians to the fact that log construction was not the building form of
 choice for most seventeenth-century English colonists. An unintended
 consequence has been a lack of appreciation for how popular log con
 struction became in the eighteenth century almost everywhere in rural
 America where new building occurred, including the colonies already
 settled in the 1600s. In long-settled regions of Pennsylvania, if houses

 were not constructed of stone or brick, they were built of log (see Table
 II). The practice extended across the border to rural Upper Gunpowder
 and Mine Run hundreds in Baltimore County, Maryland, where 71 per
 cent of the dwellings were log, nearly the same proportion recorded a
 generation earlier in an estate survey of the same area. Dividing Creek
 and Pocomoke in Somerset County, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,
 remained predominately frame, but just north in the rural Eastern Shore
 communities of Queen Anne's County, from one-third to one-half of
 residents had been building their houses out of logs since the early eigh
 teenth century. Though the tidewater Maryland hundreds in Saint
 Marys County had few log dwellings, in Virginia log constituted 27 per
 cent of the housing in Berkeley Parish in Spotsylvania, and farther south
 in Halifax County, a 1780s tax list revealed more than 90 percent of
 dwellings to be built of log. In the Carolinas and Georgia, log also
 appears to have been the dominant construction type in rural areas.20

 Log construction could range from a cabin to a two-story, hewn-log
 and-plaster structure with a stone foundation, a chimney, and glass win
 dows. Older townships in Pennsylvania had many of the more
 substantial types of log dwellings (Table III). The average value of log
 dwellings in these older townships could go far above the $100 limit, as
 demonstrated by the high averages for log houses in Hempfield
 Township, a heavily German American township in Lancaster County.
 Several factors contributed to the high price attached to the housing
 there. Hempfield contained some of the richest farmland in
 Pennsylvania, and also about one-third of the houses were located in a
 small town, Columbia, within the township. In addition the dimensions
 of Hempfield Township's log houses were more than 50 percent larger

 than the typical log dwelling. Yet even in the townships where better
 built log dwellings prevailed, this type of housing fell below the average
 value of a community's stone or brick residences, more often lacked a
 second floor, and more frequently earned the description old or in poor
 repair.

 Benjamin Latrobe captures the full effect of America's log villages on

 the refinement sensibility in his written and pictorial account of his visit
 to the home of quarrier William Robertson in Stafford County,
 Virginia, a coastal county on the Potomac settled since the seventeenth
 century. Latrobe, the architect of the U.S. Capitol, clearly found the
 building practices of his adopted land exasperating. His dry wit emerges
 not only in his writings but also in his drawing, which situates
 Robertson's twenty-four-by-eighteen-foot, two-story log house in the
 center of a barren landscape of stumps, all that was left of the trees used
 to construct the house and outbuildings (Figure VI). Unfazed by this
 less-than-picturesque "Virginia style" setting, two people are shown
 relaxing in chairs in front of the house. Behind the dwelling Robertson
 had erected a separate kitchen. In Latrobe's rendering highly flammable
 log chimneys seem precariously propped against the sides of each build
 ing. In addition the architect sketched all the other small structures his
 friend had "sprinkled irregularly" around the property: a stable, smith
 shop, toolhouse, henhouse, and meat house. His journal relates what it
 was like to spend a night in this "romantic" (in the sense of fantastic or
 unreal) setting. The reader learns that "a chasm" between the logs in his

 guest room had permitted the insertion of a volume of Arabian Nights.
 The gaps between the wood, however, served as more than shelving,
 supplying an easy entr?e for vermin. A warning by the lady of the house
 to beware of rats proved prescient. All night rodents disrupted Latrobe's
 sleep as they scurried about searching for food that had been left in odd
 places throughout the premises. At more than eight hundred total
 square feet, this two-story dwelling with its numerous outbuildings
 would have been considered on the upper end of log-house living,
 though probably not by the audience Latrobe had in mind as he penned
 his thoughts.21

 A striking geographic pattern emerges when comparing house sizes in
 older rural communities (see Table II). As one goes north to south,
 square footage shrinks. At first glance the contrast is quite startling,
 from an average house size of more than 1,700 square feet in Topsfield
 Township, Essex County, Massachusetts, to 478 square feet in two hun
 dreds of Saint Marys County, Maryland. The variation in the number of

 multistory dwellings is an important factor. Whereas 80 percent of
 Topsfield residences were two stories, only 1 percent were in Saint Marys
 County. In Upton Township, Worcester County, a community located
 in central Massachusetts, little more than one in five residences had a

 second story. A study based on a large group of dwellings in that county
 reports that about one-third had the full extra floor.22 In the farming
 community of Richmond Township, Washington County, Rhode Island,
 the proportion dropped to 10 percent.

 The variation in house size among regions is actually less dramatic
 than it first appears. Part of the discrepancy is an artifact of the method
 used to calculate total square footage. Multiplying the dimensions of the
 house by the number of stories favors New England dwellings and disad
 vantages those in the Chesapeake. Though enumerators usually identi
 fied full second-story residences, they did not always indicate the
 one-and-a-half-story houses that existed in all regions but were particu
 larly plentiful in the older settlements of the tidewater.

 Differences in the location of domestic workspace also favored New

 England. Today a family house is a well-defined structure where sleep
 ing, socializing, eating, preparing and storing food, cooking, and wash
 ing are accomplished within and where no more than an inexpensive
 garage exists as a separate structure. In many early American rural com
 munities, however, domestic tasks often took place in separate outbuild
 ings. These outbuildings were not the barns, artisanal shops, and other
 occupational structures used for production purposes but domestic out
 buildings identified by enumerators as being primarily used for household
 consumption: kitchens, dairies, springhouses, smokehouses, washhouses,
 as well as early American counterparts to garages, stables or carriage
 houses.23 Enumerators included the value of those buildings in the dol
 lar value of dwellings, though they seldom recorded the square footage.
 The geographic distribution of domestic outbuildings follows a regional
 pattern that is the reverse of the one for house square footage (see Table II).
 The few domestic outbuildings recorded for New England were usually for
 storing wood. In the mid-Atlantic, domestic outbuildings became much
 more common, and in the South they outnumbered dwellings. Plantation
 slavery in the South clearly contributed to this proliferation of structures
 surrounding the main dwelling because slaves might have lived in them or
 in a separate space identified as a slave quarter or Negro house.

 Cultural Landscape of the Central Uplands of Massachusetts in the Eighteenth
 Century" (Ph.D. diss., Clark University, 1988), 320.

 23 The 1798 tax assessors made a distinction between buildings used for occupa
 tional purposes and those meant primarily for household consumption. The former
 were evaluated as part of improvements on the land in a separate schedule.

 Researchers have speculated as to why domestic outbuildings proved

 so popular in the states outside New England.24 Contemporaries cited
 hot weather and fire danger from open hearths as reasons to move cer
 tain tasks outside main dwellings, though some historians have also
 argued that the desire to separate family members from servants and
 slaves furnished an incentive to build structures apart from main houses.
 Moreover householders may have found it easier and more economical
 to add outbuildings gradually rather than having to erect one big house.
 Whatever the reason for the outbuildings, they apparently reduced
 the size of the house proper in the mid-Atlantic and the South because
 householders prepared food, washed clothes, and did other chores out
 side the main house. The New England use of lean-tos and sheds rather
 than separate outbuildings skewed the numbers in its favor in yet
 another way. In two-story New England houses, the dimensions of the
 first floor included the square footage of the attachments, yet more often
 than not these attachments lacked the additional story. Doubling the
 total ground floor area, therefore, overestimated total square footage.

 A final complication in comparing dwelling square footage arises

 from the custom in some New England townships of building double
 houses, in which a lateral addition was attached to the original structure
 or an existing large timber-frame home was partitioned to create sepa
 rate residences for more than one family. Sometimes these living spaces
 were separately enumerated as half houses with the square footage per
 taining to each listed, but in other townships the listing of two names as
 possessors and owners furnished the only clue that two separate house
 holds occupied the structure. In the latter case, the per-dwelling square
 footage was overestimated.25

 If all these elements are factored into the difference in square footage

 between the two extremes of Topsfield Township and Saint Marys County,

 24 For a discussion of the various rationales for outbuildings, see Donald W.

 Linebaugh, "'All the Annoyances and Inconveniences of the Country':
 Environmental Factors in the Development of Outbuildings in the Colonial
 Chesapeake," Winterthur Portfolio 29, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 1-18.

 25 Bernard L. Herman discusses the household arrangements made for widows

 in New England cities. See Herman, Town House: Architecture and Material Life in
 the Early American City, 1780-1830 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 2005), chap. 5. Charles
 Parrott discusses double houses largely as a design type between the row house and
 the detached house in cities. See Parrott, "The Double House in New England," in
 Building Environments: Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture, ed. Kenneth A. Breisch
 and Alison K. Hoagland (Knoxville, Tenn., 2005), 33_4^. A further question is
 whether this practice of dividing the house among the widow and children helps
 explain New England's much greater kinship propinquity discovered in Daniel Scott
 Smith, "'All in Some Degree Related to Each Other': A Demographic and
 Comparative Resolution of the Anomaly of New England Kinship," American
 Historical Review 94, no. 1 (February 1989): 44-79.

 the gap narrows considerably. Assuming an upper floor only covered two
 thirds of the ground floor space in Topsfield Township, the other one-third
 consisted of a one-story lean-to or addition, meaning the square footage
 would drop to a little less than 1,400. Furthermore almost one-quarter
 (24.3 percent) of the dwellings had two families in them. Dividing by
 households rather than by dwellings produces a dwelling size of 1,156
 square feet. With Saint Marys County, it is likely that the one-story
 dwellings were actually one-and-a-half stories, raising the square footage to
 717. Adding the average size of a detached kitchen in Saint Marys County
 (277 square feet) produces a total domestic space per family of approxi
 mately 994 square feet, still less than the average square footage in
 Topsfield Township but much closer than the initial figures suggested.

 For those adhering to more cosmopolitan standards of architecture,
 a couple of outbuildings did not equal a second story. A landscape of
 small structures clustered around an unimpressive main house excited
 comment in more than one European travel account. The plantation
 built environment was described variously as a little village, as a bevy of
 booths at a country fair, or, most imaginatively, "as a litter of pigs" fol
 lowing "their mother."26 The surprised reaction of visitors from abroad
 indicates that the enthusiasm for domestic outbuildings no longer pre
 vailed in many parts of contemporary Europe but that these structures
 clearly satisfied some American needs.

 That New Englanders less frequently cluttered the landscape with
 domestic outbuildings does not mean their rural built environment rep
 resented the epitome of order and regularity. Most dwellings in this
 period were not the tidy and symmetrical federal or Greek revival struc
 tures that line the streets of historic town squares in the region today.
 Instead the construction resembled that of the first great rebuilding of
 Tudor-Stuart England, the period during which the region's ancestors had
 immigrated. The signposts of progress were there?two-story construction
 around a central cooking hearth with chimney and glazed windows?but
 so were the awkward additions tacked on at every angle to the wooden
 frame. The rather low dollar-per-square-foot value of houses in the region
 hints that though the space under the roof was large by contemporary
 standards and the central frame sturdy, the attached lean-tos and sheds

 measured as part of the dwelling were poorly put together. They gave many
 New England timber-frame dwellings a rambling, disheveled appearance
 (Figure VII). The multiple planes of the sides and roofs of the Fairbanks
 House in Dedham, Massachusetts, look as if the Yankee homeowner had

 retained the design services of Frank Gehry but carried out the construc
 tion himself. An alternative method of household expansion, the double
 house, where the addition nearly but not exactly replicated the original,
 offered a cleaner line yet suffered from the same asymmetry as a botched
 clone.27

 Not surprisingly, the number of glass windows in older communities

 followed housing square footage, with one window for every one hun
 dred to two hundred square feet of dwelling space (see Table II). Glazing
 on the windows supplied light while protecting households from the ele
 ments, and houses without such windows were viewed as substandard by
 enumerators. For a dwelling to be assessed at more than $100, it had to
 have some window glass, though glazed windows did not ensure that sta
 tus. In Richmond Township, Washington County, Rhode Island, 73 per
 cent of dwellings valued at $100 or less had one or more windows; in
 Saint Marys County, Maryland, 53 percent had at least one window; and
 in Somerset County, Maryland, 38 percent had at least one window.

 For housing in more recently settled areas, new seldom translated
 into better. In all communities from north to south, the average assessed
 values for house and lot fell below $101 (see Table II). Dwellings were
 overwhelmingly made of log and cabins abounded. Builders of log
 dwellings suffered from size constraints because the length of a side was
 limited by the height of trees. Consequently, most homes were less than
 five hundred square feet. To obviate the problem of not having enough
 long pieces of timber, residents erected what were basically two small log
 houses and connected them with a chimney (saddlebag house plan) or,
 more commonly, a covered passage (dogtrot). Those strategies explain
 the relatively high square footage observed in Virginia's Shenandoah
 Valley. Despite the large size, more than two-thirds of the dwellings were
 described as cabins or as being old or needing repair. Whether cabin or
 house, log adorned the exterior of nearly all the dwellings; 36 percent
 had no chimney and of those that did, one in six chimneys was made of
 wood covered with clay, a clear fire risk.28

 Some newer communities in Maine had log dwellings, though not

 to the same degree as communities of the same vintage elsewhere. The
 preferences of settlers originally from Massachusetts and the long-term
 presence of sawmills may have made other types of wood construction
 more popular and available. The severe winter weather also encouraged
 people to keep as much of the domestic work as possible in attached
 rather than detached structures or breezeways. With fewer log cabins,
 the average value of housing ($65) in sample townships of York County
 ranked higher than in many other frontier areas but lower than in all the
 longer-settled communities. More than two-thirds of dwellings in that
 county were assessed at or less than $100. Most of the people in these
 samples, whether from Maine, upstate New York, western Pennsylvania,
 or the Shenandoah Valley, apparently lived similarly to those early
 sixteenth-century English described by Elizabethan commentators as
 occupying small, dark dwellings lacking a foundation, glass, interior
 plaster, and a chimney. The small size of the dwellings and the high ratio

 for portions of Halifax Co., another Virginia co. formed around the same time as
 those in the Shenandoah. See Nicholls, "Building the Virginia Southside."

 of people to dwellings suggests that they were crowded, especially during
 cold weather.29

 By 1798 the log dwelling had emerged as the most common form of hous
 ing in the United States, and it should probably appear more prominently
 in general histories of vernacular architecture. Attractively priced and con
 structed with little or no professional assistance from readily available
 materials, it swept over the competition, crossing ethnic, regional, and
 even class lines. Log construction was ubiquitous among the 36 percent of
 the population living in the vast areas settled after 1765; 85 percent of
 homes were one-story log structures usually described as cabins, meaning
 no foundation, no glazed windows, and no chimney, or as being old or in
 poor repair. Improvement came slowly because many frontier households
 moved more than once. Communities, especially in their early years, expe
 rienced high population turnover.30

 This so-called architecture of migration, however, was not just a
 frontier phenomenon. It also affected the 58 percent of the population
 living in rural areas settled prior to 1765. The most highly valued hous
 ing in such places was not made of log and varied regionally from large
 timber-frame dwellings in southeastern New England, especially along
 the coast, to stone houses in southeastern Pennsylvania, to Georgian
 brick dwellings in the southern tidewater. But each housing type had
 difficulty spreading beyond the long-established or more affluent seg
 ment of society. The New England timber frame was probably the most

 29 For other work demonstrating the presence of log in Maine, see Hubka, Big
 House, Little House, 37; Taylor, Liberty Men and Great Proprietors, 81-82, 258, 261. In
 Limerick Twp. a number of dwellings are specifically identified as lacking chimneys.
 For the lack of chimneys in many Shenandoah Valley cabins, see Church, "Early
 Architecture of the Lower Valley," 28-29. She quotes Thaddeus Mason Harris on
 this distinction between a cabin and a house (Harris, Journal of a Tour into the
 Territory Northwest of the Alleghany Mountains [Boston, 1805], 15). For additional
 information on the distinction, see Hutslar, Log Construction in the Ohio Country,
 76-80. Most likely the extremely high ratio of people to dwellings in places such as
 Champlain Twp., Clinton Co., N.Y., or the new settlements in York Co., Maine,
 resulted from enumerators mistakenly counting tenants or inmates as residing in
 their landlords' outbuildings rather than in separate dwellings.

 States in Ontario and Quebec. See Mary K. Cullen, "Highlights of Domestic

 successful in that regard, yet poorer households did not replicate the
 two-storied version. Moreover its use of wood and a form that show

 cased the central chimney and fireplace characteristic of Tudor-Stuart
 England rebuilding had limited relevance to the standards of construc
 tion being touted in the late eighteenth century.

 In the mid-Atlantic and the South, log dwellings had infiltrated the
 countryside by the early eighteenth century.31 The principal refinements
 in housing that prosperous residents might undertake were a transition
 to hewn logs, the plastering of internal walls, the replacement of
 wooden chimneys with stone, the glazing of windows, and the addition
 of a second story. Many owners considered such structures permanent
 dwellings, but those who hoped for a rebuilding revolution to sweep
 America did not. Though these log houses were improvements over cab
 ins, the 1798 tax samples reveal that construction and repair issues
 plagued wooden dwellings of all types, whether frame or log, especially
 in the South.

 Though problems of faulty construction and disrepair were found

 everywhere, they seemed to occur more often in long-established southern
 rural communities than in communities of a similar vintage elsewhere.
 The prevalence of modest dwellings of less than six hundred square feet
 on average that rarely had a full second story as well as the heavy reliance
 on outbuildings for domestic space furnish further evidence that the
 region s householders suffered from a shortage of people with construction
 skills or a reluctance to employ them when indentured or slave labor
 could suffice. Research on construction outside of urban areas in Virginia
 and North Carolina describes a system where few professional contractors
 existed even for expensive projects and much of the physical work fell to
 indentured convict labor during the colonial period and later to slave
 laborers "who had little hope of profiting from their work." For higher
 end houses or public buildings, the elite often sought out craftsmen from
 abroad or from northern cities such as Philadelphia. The slower develop
 ment of urban centers in the South may have hampered the growth of
 professional building trades and delayed the procurement of building
 materials, including glass, paint, and lime.32

 31 Besides the localities enumerated in Table II, research on the Hudson Valley

 in New York, western New Jersey, and Delaware indicates that log had a strong
 presence in these long-settled areas as well. See Wacker, "Relations between Cultural

 HOUSING STOCK OF THE EARLY UNITED STATES 581

 Variations also appear that hint at another possible cause for the

 South's troubled dwellings: out-migration without compensating immi
 gration. Tidewater areas such as Saint Marys County, the original site of
 the colony of Maryland in the seventeenth century, seem to have been
 more afflicted by a substandard housing stock than other older commu
 nities. The value of Saint Marys County's housing stock, with an average
 of $66 per dwelling and 50 percent of the housing stock deemed old or
 out of repair, resembled the frontier more than a long-established town
 ship. The theory that the continued reliance on tobacco cultivation
 diminished the standard of living could apply to Saint Marys County's sit
 uation. The failure to find a new economic base manifests itself in the end

 as an out-migration problem. Saint Marys County lost increasing numbers
 of people to Kentucky, Tennessee, and other areas even farther west in the
 postrevolutionary period. A study of the effects of migration on early
 national and antebellum Virginia reveals how a rapid outflow of popula
 tion could wreak as much havoc on a community's prosperity as rapid in
 migration.33 Some older rural areas in the North also experienced
 out-migration, but immigrants and city growth kept Northern states and
 their hinterlands healthier than Southern states, which had fewer cities

 and less immigration to balance out the loss of rural population.

 Those championing a rebuilding achieved their biggest success in
 cities, where (unfortunately for them) only 6 percent of the population
 lived. The housing in central portions of American cities?multistory
 brick buildings filled with windows?exhibited the traits of refinement,
 comfort, and durability prized by contemporaries. Most likely, munici
 pal governments and insurance companies along with the enlightened
 self-interest of some property owners tried to push such housing
 improvements into outlying neighborhoods and smaller provincial
 towns. Opposition sprang up, however. When municipalities passed laws
 requiring brick and other construction upgrades after fires, the cost led
 many residents to campaign against such improvements.34

 The quest for more refined, durable, and well-built housing that

 met some transatlantic standard came up against a different set of priori
 ties held by another segment of the population. But what exactly were
 these priorities that led to such a frenetic pace of internal migration dur
 ing the seventy or so years from the mid-i76os to the 1830s? The usual
 explanation is that people left cities and long-established settlements to
 find cheaper land to farm, to gain a competency as contemporaries
 phrased it and as historians like to repeat. This conclusion seems incom
 plete because it neglects the presence of alternative means to gain a com
 petency. Density levels in longer-established rural and small-town
 settlements (those settled before 1765) in Massachusetts, Maine,
 Pennsylvania, and Maryland averaged 43.6 people per square mile.
 Assuming a household size of about 7 people, that would mean roughly
 6 households to divide up 640 acres, a little more than 106 acres each,
 not exactly crowding by European (not to mention Asian) standards.
 But land was already taken, one can hear social historians roar. True, but
 as most of the migrants would find out, so was most of the good land on
 the frontier, where the only odds that improved were those for foreclo
 sure. Why did not more adult sons go into nonagricultural production
 of goods and services in their home regions? Two decades of research on
 consumption have established that American agricultural communities
 were not self-sufficient. They depended on a mercantile sector to obtain
 tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, cloth, dishes, metal tools, and so forth, and
 they needed the services of artisans. If the community was in economic
 decline, a youth could also go to a city. Yet a high proportion of young
 people in these years poured into land with limited agricultural poten
 tial, uncertain ownership rights, and questionable market access.
 Eventually, more would move into nonagricultural pursuits, but the
 mystery is, why not earlier? Because young men from farming back
 grounds often lacked the training or skills for nonagricultural work
 above that of a common laborer or servant, they would have had to take
 the time to learn those skills in the shops or households of others.
 Marriage would have had to be put on hold. Waiting for older farmers

 to die or retire could postpone household formation as well. Americans
 had a neolocal marriage system, whereby the norm was for a couple to
 establish their own household apart from either set of parents immedi
 ately or soon after the wedding. They also had a well-established tradi
 tion of women marrying on average four years earlier than European

 women. Early marriages mostly account for America's high fertility rate.
 Thomas Jefferson apparently did not pick up on the contradiction
 between demanding more durable housing and pushing for enough land
 to be available for young would-be yeomen, but the connection would
 not have been lost on Thomas Robert Malthus.35

 That frontier areas had higher fertility rates is a commonplace

 observation in the economic history literature. Couples living in areas
 where land was cheap, the argument goes, had more children because
 they needed the labor and knew they would have enough property to
 endow all offspring later. Research has cast doubt on just how much
 children contributed to frontier agriculture and whether any sign of
 family limitation within marriage in older settler communities can be
 identified prior to 1850. Apparently, spinsterhood or marriage postpone
 ment brought about the decline in fertility rates in long-established
 communities. Thus men and women who wanted to start families early
 went to frontier areas despite the lower living standards almost certainly
 awaiting them. Using 1798 housing data on the aggregate (community,
 not individual) level and combining it with data from the 1800 decennial
 census shows that a community's fertility rate was negatively correlated
 with the dollar value of nonresidential land, density, and period of settle
 ment and that after controlling for these other variables, a higher fertility
 rate still lowered the average value of dwellings (Table IV). If high fertility
 was a strategy for success on the frontier, it was a poor one. Rather the
 results are more consistent with the notion that around 1800 people
 migrated to the frontier because its lower cost of living enabled them to
 form households sooner or support an already large household more eas
 ily. The trade-off for having a household earlier, though, was substandard
 housing.36

 surprisingly tried to get included in the Virginia Constitution a type of Lord
 Hardwicke Act allowing parents to void the marriages of their underage children.

 The state of the housing stock after 1800 remains something of a mys
 tery. Unfortunately for the historian, though not for the taxpayer, after
 the violent protests over the intrusiveness of the 1798 tax, the federal gov
 ernment decided not to renew the direct tax legislation. Fragmentary evi
 dence from other sources offers little support for assuming any widespread
 change during the early nineteenth century in the dwellings of rural
 America. An 1810 survey of housing in North Carolina reports little else
 but log and some wood frame. In 1815 the federal government briefly rein
 stituted a housing tax to help pay for the war with Britain. The only enu
 merations comparable to the 1798 returns in this tax are for the
 approximately eight thousand houses of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
 The returns show only modest increases during the seventeen-year period
 in brick dwellings and two-story houses in older rural communities.37
 A more comprehensive look at housing is available in 1840, thanks
 to a question in that year's census concerning the composition and value

 her coauthors summarize these comments (Bishir et al., Architects and Builders,

 tax for the city of Lancaster, Hempfield Twp., and Conestoga Twp. as well as the
 totals for the co. in 1815 in Thomas A. Lainhoff, "The Buildings of Lancaster
 County, 1815" (master's thesis, Pennsylvania State University, 1981). Gabrielle M.
 Lanier's statistics on dwelling material for Warwick Twp. follow the same pattern as
 the other localities. See Lanier, Delaware Valley, 185.

 of houses constructed during the previous twelve months. Eighty-four
 percent of the new housing in the thirty states, U.S. territories, and fed
 eral district was wooden; that proportion was an underestimate because
 it only included housing constructed by professional builders, not the
 self-constructed dwellings that invariably were made from logs, timber,
 or earthen materials. An 1855 census for the state of New York, one of
 the older and most prosperous states in the union, confirms the small
 inroads that brick had made into the housing stock.38 Only 13 percent of
 housing in the state consisted of brick or stone structures. More than 80
 percent of such buildings were located in New York City, Brooklyn, and
 the counties containing Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Schenectady, and
 Troy. The average values tell why wood won out over brick or stone:
 $2,618 for brick houses in rural counties, $1,505 for stone, $540 for
 wood frame, $152 for plank and board, and $36 for log.

 That the nineteenth-century United States remained largely a
 wooden built environment seems indisputable, but the question of when
 log ended its reign remains. Based on the admittedly limited 1815 results
 for Lancaster County, there is little evidence that people had transi
 tioned from log houses and cabins to lighter-frame structures. In those
 tax returns, dwellings made of log constituted a similar share of the
 housing in the borough of Lancaster and preserved their dominance in
 the countryside. A different picture emerges from the 1855 census cover
 ing New York's half-million dwellings. This source implies that the
 architecture of migration had virtually been obliterated in the Empire
 State. Most of the area, except for New York City and the eastern coun
 ties surrounding the Hudson River, had been settled after 1765. Thus in
 1798 log dwellings upstate appeared ubiquitous: 85 percent of the houses
 in Champlain Township, Clinton County, were made of log. And
 though not dominant, log houses even showed up in the long-settled
 county of Dutchess. But by 1855 log dwellings had dropped to 28 per
 cent of the housing stock in Clinton County and 6 percent in all of
 New York State. Log had been swept away by wood frame, which consti
 tuted 78 percent of the state's dwellings. Obviously, frame did not beat
 out log because of price convergence. The mean value of frame houses
 was fifteen times that of log houses. The better type of log dwelling had

 apparently disappeared or become so ramshackle that it had almost no
 value. Instead these northeastern families switched to a carpenter-built
 wood frame. Changes in technology may have made this switch more
 economically feasible, but an actual increase in housing investment also
 seems to have occurred. From 1798 to 1855, housing materials and labor
 only rose about 39 percent, yet in the rural North, nonlog wooden
 houses registered a 360 percent increase in average value.39 Though the
 transformation in the housing stock envisioned by federal-era refine
 ment advocates may not have materialized in the countryside, the
 wooden built environment of the North improved.

 An analysis of the 1798 direct tax shows that period of settlement,
 population density, and lower fertility rates all raised the value of a com
 munity's housing. Looking at the demographic trends during the first
 half of the nineteenth century, the slow pace of improvement becomes
 more understandable. In the United States as a whole, the rate of fron

 tier settlement did not abate and the rate of urbanization did not signifi
 cantly increase until 1840. In the thirty years after 1840, the population
 living in cities with twenty-five hundred people or more climbed from 11
 to 26 percent; the increase had been only from 6 to 9 percent from 1800
 to 1830. The decades around 1800 are believed to mark the nadir in the
 average marriage age (which correlates inversely to fertility rates) for
 American women; most likely, the average rose after 1820, thus reducing
 fertility rates. Not surprisingly, the one place where historians have seen
 evidence of early-nineteenth-century improvement in the rural housing

 39 Thomas R. Ryan finds in an Ulster Co., N.Y., twp. settled in the seventeenth

 century that stone dwellings predominated among dwellings worth more than $100,
 with log dwellings representing only 5 percent, but estimates that the dwellings val
 ued at $100 or less were primarily log like those in the adjacent twp. of New Paltz.
 See Ryan, "Cultural Accommodations," 140. On carpentry, see Wayne Franklin, A
 Rural Carpenter s World: The Craft in a Nineteenth-Century New York Township
 (Iowa City, Iowa, 1990). According to Franklin, the carpenter profiled in this book
 did not build balloon-frame structures but in ways such as his substitution of stoves
 for large masonry hearths was not constructing completely traditional timber-frame
 houses either. In both North and South, builders were simplifying the carpentry
 work and relying on milled lumber. See Cavanagh, "Who Designed Your House?";
 Graham, "Preindustrial Framing in the Chesapeake," 179-96. On construction
 costs, see Susan B. Carter et al., Historical Statistics of the United States: Earliest
 Times to the Present, Millennial Edition (New York, 2006), 3: 181-82 (table
 CCI13-124); Donald R. Adams Jr., "Residential Construction Industry in the Early
 Nineteenth Century," Journal of Economic History 35, no. 4 (December 1975):
 794-816. Adams shows that the ratio of material costs and labor costs remained rela
 tively constant throughout the period under discussion. The 360 percent increase is
 based on a comparison of the average value of 828 houses described as wood or
 wood frame in the 1798 tax returns from Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New
 York, and Pennsylvania and more than 295,000 dwellings (281,000 of them frame;
 the rest, plank) tabulated in the New York State census of 1855.

 stock is Massachusetts, which led the nation in density, urbanization,
 and spinsterhood.40 The 1840 census reveals that, more than any vari
 able, a state's density enhanced the average value of its new housing. Yet
 even with density held constant along with the proportion of houses in
 brick and stone and the availability of craftsmen, recently constructed
 dwellings in southern and central states were of lesser value than those
 in northeastern states. Many factors may account for these two regions
 having cheaper housing, but one of particular importance is the longer
 continuation in both regions of lower marriage ages and consequently
 higher fertility rates.

 When the log dwelling lost its status as the most common form of
 shelter in the United States, probably during the period 1840-60, it
 assumed an iconic role in the politics and imagination of Americans.
 Houses afterward remained resolutely wooden, even as later migrants pro
 ceeded into lands that lacked not only carpenters but also forests. Though
 refinement ideals failed to transform the housing stock of the early United
 States, they exerted enormous influence on the nation's cityscape, a legacy
 that grew in importance as the urbanization rate increased. When it comes
 to the U.S. housing stock, demographic changes have always played an
 important role in setting and reversing trends.

 Information on the northern Shenandoah Valley, Shenandoah and
 Frederick (later Warren) counties, Va., 1786, is not based on the 1798 fed
 eral tax. Instead the data came from a transcription of the 1786 Jonathan
 Clark notebook found in Peggy Shomo Joyner, comp., Abstracts of
 Virginia's Northern Neck Warrants and Surveys: Hampshire, Berkeley,
 Loudoun, Fairfax, King George, Westmoreland, Richmond, Northumberland,
 and Lancaster Counties, 1697-1784 (Portsmouth, Va., 1987), 4: 161-85.
 Kevin Kelly at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation alerted me to this
 material and kindly furnished a copy of it. The original notebook is in the
 Filson Club collection in Louisville, Ky. These data have been studied in
 Barbara Hume Church, "The Early Architecture of the Lower Valley of
 Virginia" (master's thesis, University of Virginia, 1978).
