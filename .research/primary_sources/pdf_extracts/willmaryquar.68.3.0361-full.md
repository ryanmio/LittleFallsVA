The Visible Fist:
The Chesapeake Tobacco Trade in War 
and the Purpose of Empire, 1690–1715

Douglas Bradburn

O N  June 20, 1701, the administrative, political, and economic capital of 

Virginia was literally at sea, at anchor off Kickotan in Hampton Roads. 
The  seat  of  power  was  the  great  cabin  of  HMS  Shoreham,  where  the 
Virginia Council of State was meeting to finalize plans for an emergency military 
convoy for the tobacco fleet. Virginia had ended its embargo on shipping, yet the 
Council of State decided that the fleet could not sail without protection, and the 
Shoreham’s replacement on station, the fourth-rate HMS Southampton, had not 
yet  arrived.  Though  England  was  not  at  war,  rumors  of  an  imminent  conflict 
with France circulated widely—rumors that would soon be proven true.

The  tobacco  ship  masters,  for  their  part,  yearned  to  get  to  sea.  The 
seasoning  of  the  summer  months  and  the  worm  that  devoured  their  ships 
(Bankia  gouldi,  actually  a  mollusk)  would  prove  disastrous  if  they  lingered 
much longer. And for the seventy-five ships riding at anchor, the extra cost 
in  wages  and  provisions  consumed  equaled  “above  one  hundred  pounds 
Charge  a  day.”  Nevertheless  the  masters  refused  to  sail  in  a  simple  convoy, 
huddled together for the supposed safety of numbers, with no military escort. 
As these men knew, such a plan was a study in the limits of virtue. Merchant 
ships  were  known  for  their  “Independancy  and  Devisions.”  Experience 
showed  that  if  they  were  attacked  it  would  be  every  man  for  himself,  as  “a 
Fleet of Merchts Ships wth out a man of warr are no Safety at all nor of any 
Importance to each other.” Instead they wanted the governor of Virginia to 
provide a man-of-war with the state’s official imprimatur, with permission to 
use  “Power  Offensive  and  Defensive”  and  authority  to  bind  and  command 
the fleet in “some Regular Method or ordr.”1

Douglas  Bradburn  is  an  associate  professor  in  the  Department  of  History  at 
Binghamton  University,  State  University  of  New  York.  He  would  like  to  particularly 
acknowledge  the  helpful  support  of  John  C.  Coombs,  Victor  Enthoven,  J.  David 
Hacker, James R. Lothian, Cathy Matson, and attendees of the Seminar of the McNeil 
Center for Early American Studies, each of whom read earlier versions of this essay and 
provided valuable criticism and insight.

The solution was the creation of a special commission for the master of 
the  largest  merchant  vessel  in  the  fleet,  the  five-hundred-ton  Virginia-built 
Indian King, owned by councillor Daniel Parke. The commission made the 
Indian  King’s  master  commodore  of  the  convoy,  with  “Power  and  authori- 
ty” to “Comand the rest of the Ships Sailing out in the fleet.”2 Promising 
to obey the orders of the Indian King, the masters bound themselves to the 
commission, signed under the seal of His Majesty’s Dominion of Virginia, 
and  went  to  sea.  For  the  public  good,  the  state’s  coercive  power  would 
protect  and  constrain  the  grosser  instincts  of  these  competitors.  They  had 
called on the visible fist.3

An  awareness  of  the  visible  fist,  the  role  of  state  coercion  in  the  mar-
ket,  is  crucial  to  understanding  the  character  of  the  Chesapeake  economy 
from the early 1690s to the 1710s, when a massive military presence proved 
necessary  to  secure  the  market  for  tobacco  and  set  the  shape  of  the  trade. 
In  fact  the  Atlantic  dynamic  of  the  trade  in  tobacco  dramatically  shifted 
during the long stretches of war (King William’s War, 1689–97, and Queen 
Anne’s  War,  1702–13)  that  bracketed  the  turn  of  the  eighteenth  century.4 
From a system that was relatively open, porous, promiscuous, diverse, and 
competitive, the Atlantic trade in tobacco became heavily constrained and 
controlled, rigidly scheduled, characterized by high barriers to entry, open 
to  political  manipulation,  and  limited  to  a  specific  size  based  not  on  the 
trends  of  supply  and  demand  but  on  negotiations  among  the  Admiralty, 
the  Board  of  Trade,  and  the  leading  tobacco  merchants.  The  Virginia 
planter-merchants  who  could  get  access  to  this  politically  driven  market 
would reap great rewards for nearly twenty years. And the effects would last 
even  longer,  as  the  so-called  first  families  of  Virginia  solidified  their  con-

3  If,  as  Milton  Friedman  would  have  it,  Adam  Smith’s  famous  “invisible  hand” 
implies  “the  possibility  of  cooperation  without  coercion,”  the  visible  fist  suggests  the 
role  of  coercion  in  the  possibilities  of  cooperation.  See  Milton  Friedman,  introd.  to I,

4 King William’s War, as it was known in the colonies, was part of the War of the 
League of Augsburg (1688–97), in which Louis XIV’s France fought against the Duchy 
of Savoy, the Dutch Republic, England, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and Scotland. 
It ended with the Treaty of Ryswick, Sept. 30, 1697, which maintained colonial posses-
sions status quo ante bellum. Queen Anne’s War, as it was known in the colonies, was 
the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), fought over the crown of Spain between 
supporters of Philip V, which included France and Bavaria, and supporters of Archduke 
Charles, which included the possessions of the Austrian Hapsburgs, the Dutch Repub-
lic, Great Britain, Portugal, Prussia, and Savoy. It was resolved in favor of the Bourbon 
Philip V in the Treaty of Utrecht, Apr. 11, 1713, but the British gained Minorca, Gibral-
tar, and the asiento from Spain, while the French recognized Anne as the queen of Great 
Britain,  assented  to  British  assertions  of  influence  over  the  Iroquois,  acknowledged 
British claims to the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and ceded Acadia and the French 
half of Saint Kitts.

trol over the colony’s political life. Put simply, the economic history of the 
Chesapeake  in  these  years  cannot  be  understood  without  reference  to  the 
extensive  regulatory  regime  that  constrained,  often  with  violent  force,  the 
size, timing, and character of the tobacco market.

The  key  element  in  the  creation  and  regulation  of  this  new  system  of 
imperial  governance  was  the  extension  of  naval  power  to  the  Chesapeake 
for  the  purposes  of  convoying  tobacco  and  guarding  the  capes.  Though 
there  had  been  an  occasional  convoy  to  the  Chesapeake  before  the  end 
of the seventeenth century, the English navy had never been particularly 
potent  or  effective  “between  the  Capes.”5  The  few  guard  ships  sent  in 
the  1660s  and  1670s  failed  to  stop  the  Dutch  from  seizing  and  burning 
the  tobacco  fleet  in  1667  and  1673—demoralizing  failures  that  proved 
the uselessness of forts in defending the broad Chesapeake Bay.6 Despite 
the  Virginia  council’s  repeated  calls  for  some  active  measures  to  secure 
“the  Dominion  of  the  Sea,”  their  own  inability  to  fund  an  effective  and 
permanent  defense  left  the  colony  open  to  pirates  throughout  the  early 
1680s.7 Though  some  of  the  king’s  ships  finally  arrived  to  help  enforce 
the  trade  laws  and  defend  against  pirates,  in  the  1680s  the  Chesapeake 
saw only three small English men-of-war, sloops of no more than fifteen 
guns  and  sixty  men  apiece.  At  the  outbreak  of  war  with  France  after 
the  Glorious  Revolution,  the  only  ship  on  station  was  the  ancient  sloop 
Dumbarton, which spent most of 1690 and 1691 laid up in a creek because 
it was unseaworthy.8

cil to the Privy Council repr. in “Attacks by the Dutch on the Virginia Fleet in Hamp-
ton Roads in 1667,” Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 4, no. 3 (January 1897): 
229–45. For the burning of the tobacco fleet in 1673, see a similar letter repr. in Warren

7 McIlwaine, Executive Journals, 1: 6–7 (quotation, 1: 7). The council was obsessed 
with the need to secure the waterways of the colony throughout the 1680s. As this typi-
cal  minute  shows,  they  believed  control  of  the  “Dominion  of  the  Sea”  would  provide 
safety against both internal convulsions and external threats:

The  Councill  takeing  it  into  their  serious  Consideration  how  absolute  nec-
essary  it  is  for  the  peace  and  safty  of  this  his  Majts  Country  so  full  of  great 
Rivers  Bayes  and  waters  that  the  Dominion  of  the  Sea  Should  be  preserved, 
(almost  of  equal  concern  if  not  superiour  to  any  reasonable  land  force)  wch 
cant possibly be done with less then a Ketch or Vessell of at least sixty Tunns, 
twelve Seamen with a Commander, and ten Gunns alwayes attending here the 
service of this place, wch small sea force if formerly allowed had in all proba-
bility prevented the late Rebellion, and is the most effectuall meanes wee can 
propose to prevent the like or any other disorders for the future.

furniture, and sails sold.

These  trends  changed  decisively  in  the  1690s.  During  the  last  decade 
of the seventeenth century and the first fifteen years of the eighteenth, the 
Chesapeake saw more than eighty-five English men-of-war, the majority of 
them  fourth-rate  ships  of  the  line  of  forty  to  sixty  guns  and  two  hundred 
men apiece. Sixteen thousand British sailors served in the Chesapeake dur-
ing  these  years.9  How  can  we  understand  the  purpose  and  place  of  this 
unprecedented military presence?

The ships were not there to overawe the local population or the labor 
force, or to assert royal authority against a local oligarchy; they were there 
because  they  had  been  demanded  by  the  local  oligarchs  of  Virginia  and 
their  partners,  kin,  and  allies  in  the  English  merchant  community.  From 
the  perspective  of  the  planters  and  merchants,  the  protection  regime  was 
necessary to secure the tobacco fleet in a time of war, and they would play 
a major role in its execution and design. The Admiralty needed the prod-
ding  of  the  merchants  and  planters.  In  the  first  five  months  of  hostilities, 
July–November 1689, the French seized no fewer than eleven fully loaded 
tobacco ships. Though they pleaded their own great loss, the planters and 
merchants  always  also  pointed  out  the  public  importance  of  the  trade.  As 
the  petitioners  to  the  king  noted,  “Every  ship  taken  means  a  loss  of  from 
£5,000 to £10,000 to your Majesty.”10 Without a convoy the trade would 
cease to exist—to the great detriment of the public good. For most people 
living  in  the  Chesapeake,  the  annual  fleets  that  eventually  were  mobilized 
to  secure  the  crop  were  the  most  potent  symbol  of  empire  that  they  ever 
had seen or ever would see, a source of strength and authority that marked 
the seasonal rhythms of the wartime tobacco market.

Historians  who  have  considered  the  importance  of  British  military 
power to the character of England’s Atlantic empire have either tended to 
emphasize the general impotence of the military establishment or taken the 
opposite  tack  and  found  “garrison  government”  and  the  crown’s  execu-
tive  power  as  a  strong  arm  over  local  independence.11  Yet  here  we  have 

9 The number of ships (and also sailors) is actually a little higher. My work on the 
naval vessels in the Chesapeake during these years is ongoing. I have definitive informa-
tion  on  these  eighty-five  ships  and  spotty  information  on  at  least  five  more.  I  am  also 
certain there were a few more ships that I have not yet tracked down. All the estimates 
of the size and character of the specific ships on station and in convoy have been com-
piled into a database based on nearly 140 master’s and captain’s logs, Admiralty records, 
Privy Council records, and records of the Lords (after 1696, Board) of Trade, kept at the 
British  National  Archives,  Kew,  Eng.  For  citations,  see  “Ships  on  Convoy  and  in  the

something  distinct.  The  English  naval  presence  in  the  Chesapeake  was 
not only potent and effective (in general terms) but also demanded by and 
ultimately beneficial to both local interest and a particular vision of impe-
rial interest. As an agent of state power in the Chesapeake, the Royal Navy 
served as a deterrent and a police authority and as part of the governance of 
the imperial state; it represented a branch of the revenue service rather than 
a military expeditionary fleet.12

American History, vol. 4, England’s Commercial and Colonial Policy (New Haven, Conn., 
1938),  chaps.  3–6.  For  an  ineffectual  late-seventeenth-century  empire,  see  J.  M.  Sosin, 
English America and the Revolution of 1688: Royal Administration and the Structure of Pro-
vincial  Government  (Lincoln,  Neb.,  1982).  Stephen  Saunders  Webb’s  work  emphasizes 
the  garrison  government  of  the  Stuarts  and  their  followers.  See  Webb,  “The  Strange 
Career of Francis Nicholson,” WMQ 23, no. 4 (October 1966): 513–48; Webb, “William 
Blathwayt, Imperial Fixer: From Popish Plot to Glorious Revolution,” WMQ 25, no. 1 
(January 1968): 3–21; Webb, “William Blathwayt, Imperial Fixer: Muddling through to 
Empire,  1689–1717,”  WMQ  26,  no.  3  (July  1969):  373–415;  Webb,  WMQ  34:  1–31.  See 
also  Webb,  The  Governors-General:  The  English  Army  and  the  Definition  of  the  Empire, 
1569–1681  (Chapel  Hill,  N.C.,  1979);  Webb,  1676:  The  End  of  American  Independence 
(New  York,  1984);  Webb,  Lord  Churchill’s  Coup:  The  Anglo-American  Empire  and  the 
Glorious Revolution Reconsidered (New York, 1995).

12  It  is  true  that  the  crown  relied  on  the  customs  duties  of  tobacco  and  therefore 
desired  the  fleet’s  safe  arrival,  but  my  emphasis  here  on  the  demand  of  the  merchants 
and planter-merchants reflects what happened. The actual operation of the system was 
the  result  of  the  petitions  and  design  of  the  tobacco  merchants  in  London  and  their 
Chesapeake  allies,  without  whom  the  Admiralty  would  have  been  at  a  loss  to  know 
when and where to send their vessels. The crown was a willing ally in the convoy sys-
tem,  but  the  impetus  for  its  construction  depended  on  the  planters  and  merchants. 
For some of the early petitioning that alerted the crown and Admiralty to the problem 
and  the  merchants’  needs,  see  CO  5/1305,  fols.  20–26.  My  analysis  is  informed  by  the 
literature on the emergence of the British fiscal-military state in the eighteenth century, 
most  notably  John  Brewer,  The  Sinews  of  Power:  War,  Money  and  the  English  State, 
1688–1783  (London,  1989);  Brewer  and  Eckhart  Hellmuth,  eds.,  Rethinking  Leviathan: 
The  Eighteenth-Century  State  in  Britain  and  Germany  (Oxford,  1999).  The  assumption 
of  my  work  is  that  those  studying  the  state  must  approach  the  topic  with  a  capacious 
view—that  is,  rejecting  the  idea  that  the  Weberian  state  (the  centralizing,  professional 
bureaucratic  state  with  a  monopoly  on  legitimate  violence)  is  the  only  modern  form. 
Drawing  on  the  insights  of  Michael  J.  Braddick,  Brewer,  Joanna  Innes,  and  others,  a 
study of state power needs to take a broad view of all the different types of agents of the 
state—the amateur officials, manor lords, and justices of the peace—in addition to the 
formal  officers  of  the  increasingly  impersonal  bureaucracy,  the  customs  office,  and  the 
Admiralty. See Braddick, The Nerves of State: Taxation and the Financing of the English 
State,  1558–1714  (Manchester,  Eng.,  1996);  Braddick,  State  Formation  in  Early  Modern 
England, c. 1550–1700 (Cambridge, 2000); Braddick, Negotiating Power in Early Modern 
Society: Order, Hierarchy, and Subordination in Britain and Ireland (Cambridge, 2001). 
For a useful collection of Innes’s essays, see Innes, Inferior Politics: Social Problems and 
Social  Policies  in  Eighteenth-Century  Britain  (Oxford,  2009).  State  formation  in  early 
modern  England  was  characterized  by  the  elaboration  of  governance,  not  simply  the 
creation  of  institutions.  At  the  same  time,  historians  who  have  sought  to  broaden  this 
conception of the state and governance more generally in England (and the British Isles) 
have been less interested in extending such an expansive notion of the role of power and 
authority to the broader British Empire—that is, in imagining both the theoretical and

The  naval  presence  was  really  only  one  component  of  a  tripartite  sys-
tem of trade protection that can be called the convoy and embargo regime. 
This regime, which organized the transatlantic trade during the war years of 
1690–97 and 1702–1713 and shaped the character of the market in the inter-
war  years,  included  a  trading  fleet  with  a  strict  quota  of  men,  which  fixed 
the size of the trade; a rigid calendar of embargoes and sailing times, set and 
enforced  in  both  the  English  Channel  and  the  Chesapeake;  and  the  naval 
power itself, mobilized to protect the fleet, enforce the embargoes on ship-
ping,  and  police  the  plantation  trade.  This  convoy  and  embargo  regime—
this  aggressive  and  expensive  effort  to  secure  and  control  the  transatlantic 
trade  in  tobacco—had  a  profound  effect  on  the  Chesapeake  economy  in 
these years, on the subsequent development of Virginia politics and society, 
on the articulation of merchant capitalism in England, on the development 
of mercantilism as a practice as much as a theory, and on the character of the 
eighteenth-century British Atlantic empire.

In any given year from 1690 to 1715 (though in limited form from 1698 
to 1701), the system began with the setting of a quota of sailors available for 
the total shipping allowed to any given plantation trade, such as the West 
Indies (mostly sugar), Virginia and Maryland (tobacco), and Africa (slaves). 
In  London  the  Lords  (later  Board)  of  Trade  met  and  decided  the  quota 
of men allowed in the various trades, thereby perfectly limiting the size of 
the  tobacco  trade.  Because  getting  the  convoy  fleet  together  required  time 
and communication to a variety of moving parts, rigid rules governed who 
would be allowed to clear customs and when each trade would sail. These 
embargoes  were  a  fact  of  life  in  the  English  Channel  during  the  wars  and 
could bottle up trade for weeks, or even a whole season.13

This quota fleet was a very special thing, for it was escorted across the 
Atlantic  by  at  least  two,  and  more  often  four,  fourth-rate  English  ships  of 

the real functioning of an English (and later British) imperial state—which is something 
I am concerned with trying to understand.

13  With  very  few  exceptions,  historians  have  not  taken  the  convoy  system  seri-
ously  in  the  war  years  or  considered  how  it  worked,  and  none  to  my  knowledge  have 
described  the  quota  system  on  seamen’s  protections,  which  had  the  effect  of  limiting 
the size of the merchant fleets. Sailors were in demand, and protections for one’s sailors 
were  difficult  to  come  by  during  nearly  all  major  wars.  Freight  rates  increased  because 
of the lack of shipping available, but in some cases no amount of money could purchase 
shipping without the political connections to get protections for the men who labored 
on the ships. As all the trades were affected, either directly or indirectly, there is much 
need for future research on the politics and effect of these quota systems on numerous 
trades  during  these  wars  and  others.  The  most  extensive  description  of  the  convoy  in 
these years is Arthur Pierce Middleton, “The Chesapeake Convoy System, 1662–1763,” 
WMQ  3,  no.  2  (April  1946):  182–207,  but  the  essay  has  some  serious  limitations  and 
never  captures  the  political  dynamic  that  created  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime,  the 
role  of  the  Council  of  State,  or  the  difference  between  a  simple  convoy  of  merchant 
ships and a fleet escorted by men-of-war.

the  line  (after  1707,  by  four  fourth-rates  and  a  fifth-rate)  at  a  cost  of  tens 
of thousands of pounds annually, paid by the English treasury.14 The ships 
trading  in  this  fleet  gave  bond  that  they  would  sail  to  their  agreed  desti-
nation  and  that  they  would  religiously  follow  the  sailing  instructions  of 
the  commodore.  If  a  merchant  vessel  attempted  to  lose  the  fleet  to  get  an 
advantage of an early market, the ship could be seized for violating the law.

In  the  Chesapeake,  a  similar  regulation  and  control  of  shipping  was 
necessary  to  make  the  regime  work.  Just  as  the  Admiralty,  Privy  Council, 
and customs officials—with the close input of the tobacco merchants—set 
the  terms  of  the  trade  in  England,  the  Virginia  Council  of  State,  the  col-
lectors  of  the  customs,  and  the  naval  officers  of  each  district  dictated  the 
circumstances  of  shipping  along  the  tobacco  coast.  The  Council  of  State 
set  the  timetables  and  rules  of  the  merchant  fleet.  It  dictated  where  and 
when people could sail, coordinated the supplying and refitting of the naval 
vessels  on  station  and  in  convoy,  and  became  the  arbiter  of  any  conflicts 
among  civilian,  naval,  and  commercial  authorities.  The  effective  coercion 
of  the  convoy,  intended  as  protection  and  required  for  those  purposes, 
meant  subsuming  the  individual  and  private  whims  of  numerous  trad-
ers.  As  the  council  noted  in  denying  the  pleas  of  a  hungry  crew  that  had 
consumed its provisions waiting for the fleet to come together (and had no 
credit  to  buy  more),  “perticular  Interests”  must  “submitt  to  the  publique 
Good.”15  If  there  was  a  mantra  for  the  coercive  purpose  of  the  state,  that 
was it. The Virginia councillors and the naval officers and customs collec-
tors who worked closely with them, inasmuch as they functioned to main-
tain and secure this system, were an indispensable part of the imperial state. 
Leviathan was built at both ends.

Tobacco  ships  cleared  out  of  each  river  were  forced  to  collect  at  the 
mouth  of  the  James,  off  Kickotan  and  near  Point  Comfort  (the  present-
day  site  of  Fort  Monroe),  until  the  fleet  was  ready  to  sail.  Maryland  was 
informed  of  its  projected  departure  time,  and  close  surveillance  was  put 
in  place  to  keep  ships  from  trying  to  slip  out  of  the  capes.  Tobacco  ships 
were usually not allowed to leave the bay from early March until the con-
voy sailed in late June or July. Once it sailed, shipping from the bay would 
again  be  halted  until  several  weeks  had  passed  to  limit  the  chance  of  the 
enemy’s getting vital intelligence on the fleet’s composition, date of depar-
ture, and disposition. Often another, smaller convoy left the Chesapeake in 
the fall, again creating the need for an embargo on shipping.

The numbers of men available for the Chesapeake trade, though set by 
the Lords of Trade, were divided up by the customs commissioners, based 

14 The convoy became more systematic with time. By 1707 a regular scheme was in 

place that would last until the end of the war in 1713.

on  which  merchants  paid  the  most  customs.  If  the  merchants  of  London 
did  not  like  the  proportioning  of  the  quota,  they  used  their  influence  to 
change the list and stop unknown traders from gaining access to the trade. 
As  the  tobacco  merchants  in  London  and  the  great  men  on  the  Virginia 
Council of State knew all too well, the trick was getting one’s own particu-
lar interests equated with the public good.16

To  understand  the  system  in  action,  consider  the  pace  of  events  in 
the  fall  of  1691  as  the  convoy  prepared  to  sail.  By  October  the  London 
merchants  trading  to  Virginia  and  Maryland  had  succeeded  in  getting 
their  quota  of  men  increased  from  eight  hundred  to  one  thousand  men. 
As the customs house put together the lists of ships cleared for the tobacco 
trade, a group of fifteen angry men—“the Principall merchants of this Port 
concerned  in  the  Virginia  &  Maryland  trade”—led  by  John  Jeffries,  Peter 
Paggen, and Micajah Perry, the largest traders, descended on the commis-
sioners  of  customs  and  demanded  that  a  number  of  ships  that  had  been 
cleared  for  the  colony,  and  therefore  marked  against  the  quota,  be  dis-
allowed. Responding to requirements that the complaints be put in writing 
for  the  rapid  consideration  of  the  Lords  of  Trade,  Perry  scrawled  out  his 
objections  to  “some  ships  in  the  list  of  ships  pretended  to  be  entered  for 
Virginia  &  Maryland.”  First,  there  was  the  problem  of  destination:  three 
ships on the list, Perry noted, were intended not for Virginia or Maryland 
but for Pennsylvania, so they should not be counted against the quota for 
the  Chesapeake,  and  their  exclusion  would  result  in  an  extra  twenty-three 
men. Second, one of the ships, fully seventy men, traded out of Bristol, not 
London,  and  so  should  be  counted  against  Bristol’s  quota.  Another  ship, 
the  Loyalty  (John  Price,  master),  was  “wholly  unknowne”  to  the  London 
merchants  trading  to  Maryland  and  Virginia  and  therefore  “disown’d”  by 
them.17  The  merchants  argued  that  such  ships  should  not  be  cleared  for 

16  This  discussion  of  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime  is  based  on  extensive  read-
ing  in  state  papers  now  housed  in  the  British  National  Archives,  the  British  Museum, 
and  the  Blathwayt  Papers  at  Colonial  Williamsburg’s  John  D.  Rockefeller,  Jr.  Library, 
including  Admiralty  records,  Colonial  Office  records,  and  correspondence.  Some  of 
these documents are available in published form, most particularly McIlwaine, Executive 
Journals, William Byrd’s letters in his capacity as auditor of the colony, and part of the 
Calendar  of  State  Papers,  Colonial  Series.  Rather  than  list  the  hundreds  of  citations  for 
this summary and overview of the convoy and embargo regime, I will cite only specific 
quotations  or  direct  references.  Some  of  the  more  important  collections  include  the

the  plantations  and  should  not  be  counted  against  the  quota—another 
fifty men. Finally, Perry demanded that all the ships on the list should be 
counted at only three-quarters of the number of men listed, a principle that 
he  believed  had  been  established  as  the  rule  in  an  earlier  negotiation  with 
the Admiralty.18

The  commissioners  of  customs  sent  the  merchants’  complaints  to 
William  Blathwayt,  longtime  clerk  of  the  Lords  of  Trade  and  auditor  of 
plantation  accounts.  Blathwayt  was  also  on  the  payroll  of  the  Virginia 
Council of State for one hundred pounds sterling a year as “an able and dis-
crete person” to aid Virginia quietly “near the Court.”19 With Blathwayt’s 
encouragement,  the  merchants  went  en  masse  to  directly  petition  Queen 
Mary  II,  who  gave  them  an  audience  later  that  day.  Three  days  after  that 
meeting, the Privy Council ordered that the merchants alone would make 
the final decisions on how to best divide the one thousand men allotted for 
the  trade.  The  merchants  in  turn  chose  four  men  to  represent  their  inter-
est—Samuel Groome, Paggen, Perry, and Thomas Taylor—who struck 231 
men  off  the  list  and  redistributed  the  remainder.  These  four  men  claimed 
29  percent  of  the  sailors  allotted  for  the  trade.  Two  weeks  later  their  final 
adjustments  were  made  to  the  list  of  ships,  just  in  time  for  the  convoy  to 
sail at the beginning of November.20

So  the  open  and  competitive  trading  of  the  promiscuous  peacetime 
economy,  which  was  only  controlled  by  the  regulations  of  the  Navigation 
Acts, changed during wartime into a heavily regulated, contained, and policed 
system.  Though  supply  and  demand  could  move  the  fortunes  of  the  trade 
with relative freedom during times of peace, supply was strictly limited during 
the  war  within  a  disrupted  Continental  market.  For  almost  every  year  from 
1690 to 1713, the visible fist made the market. But what effect did it have?

When considering the impact of this restrictive regime of tobacco mar-
keting, which funneled the crop into channels marked out by the imperial 
state,  a  few  points  become  clear.  The  quota  system  and  the  convoy  and 
embargo  regime  became  the  mechanism  for  the  transformation  of  scale 
identified  by  Jacob  M.  Price  and  Paul  G.  E.  Clemens  more  than  twenty 
years ago. As they pointed out, in the 1680s tobacco came into London in

claimed by those four merchants. After the distribution of sailors, the three largest mer-
chant houses controlled 22 percent of the tonnage in the trade, including the outports. 
A total of thirty-two merchants were allotted men for the trade both in London and the 
outports,  only  one  of  whom  was  a  mere  merchant,  a  man  who  was  also  master  of  his 
ship. Fourteen of the merchants (44 percent) had only one ship in the trade, and they 
controlled 20 percent of all the men.

a variety of ways. Though a little more than 50 percent of the market was 
dominated by about fifteen large importers who tended to act as consignees 
and  brokers  of  planters’  crops,  almost  half  the  crop  was  still  brought  in 
by  an  array  of  smaller  dealers  and  even  adventurers,  who  often  possessed 
diverse  trading  interests  and  for  whom  tobacco  importation  represented 
only  one  aspect  of  a  broader,  eclectic  approach  to  Atlantic  trade.  By  1718 
the trade had been completely transformed. It was now dominated by large 
merchant  houses  who  had  become  specialists  in  the  Chesapeake  trade. 
They  imported  tobacco  from  the  Chesapeake;  that  was  all  they  did,  and 
they were the only ones left who did it. The smaller merchants, the adven-
turers, had been squeezed out of the system.21

The politics behind the distribution of the quota of seamen during the 
wars ensured that only the large traders would survive. Those large traders, 
who  imported  the  most  and  generated  the  most  in  customs,  were  given 
control  over  the  scarce  numbers  of  men  allotted  for  the  trade  in  1690.  As 
we  have  seen,  they  approved  every  ship  allowed  to  go  to  the  Chesapeake, 
eager  to  grab  as  many  of  the  limited  number  of  available  seamen  as  pos-
sible.  The  smaller  operators,  the  occasional  traders,  and  the  adventurers 
lacked  the  political  skills  needed  to  negotiate  this  system;  Chesapeake 
specialists could mobilize supporters, kin, and clients in the colonies them-
selves to protect and perpetuate their advantages. By 1699 the trade in bulk 
tobacco had been made illegal (something the large traders in London had 
been trying to accomplish since at least the late 1680s), and so these fewer 
firms and their Virginia planting partners commanded the field.22

In  the  Chesapeake  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime  significantly 
affected  the  character  of  economic  growth  and  numerous  aspects  of  social 
and political development. The “stagnation” in tobacco production, which 
many  historians  of  the  Chesapeake  have  emphasized  in  interpretations 
of  the  character  of  the  society  and  economy  in  these  years  and  which  has 
almost  uniformly  been  described  as  a  “depression,”  “the  locust  years,” 
or  an  outright  disaster,  needs  significant  revision.23  The  twenty  years  of

Trade: British Firms in the Chesapeake Trade, 1675–1775,” Journal of Economic History 
47, no. 1 (March 1987): 1–43.

22  Bulk  tobacco  was  tobacco  that  was  not  packed  in  hogsheads  but  rather  bagged 
loose and therefore highly susceptible to small-scale smuggling. It could be unloaded out 
of sight of customs agents or added to a cargo by sailors on their own account. It also 
escaped proper measurement for the colonial export duty. For some examples of efforts 
to end the shipping of bulk tobacco, see the Lord President to William Blathwayt, Sept. 
22, 1690, CO 1/68, no. 13; McIlwaine, Executive Journals, 1: 511, 513, 2: 6, 25, 328.

23 For a critique of the literature on the Chesapeake economy in this period, particu-
larly the supposed effects of the stagnation of the tobacco industry from 1680 to 1710 or 
so, see Douglas M. Bradburn and John C. Coombs, “Smoke and Mirrors: Reinterpret-
ing the Society and Economy of the Seventeenth-Century Chesapeake,” Atlantic Studies

stasis  in  the  amount  of  tobacco  entering  English  ports  had  nothing  to  do 
with  a  stagnation  of  tobacco  production  resulting  from  a  “self-contained 
price-and-production  cycle”  and  everything  to  do  with  the  fact  that  the 
amount  of  shipping  allowed  in  the  trade  was  capped  by  the  convoy  and 
embargo regime.24 In fact the war years reflect a time when the momentum 
of  “boom  and  bust”  was  seriously  disrupted  by  an  absolute  limit  on  the 
amount  of  tobacco  that  could  reach  Europe  and  by  the  opportunities  for 
rent seeking granted by a system run not by the free market but by politics 
on both sides of the Atlantic.25

Significantly, this cap on the supply of shipping and the resulting ceil-
ing  on  the  amount  of  the  tobacco  crop  allowed  to  get  to  market  in  these 
years  affected  the  different  regions  of  the  Chesapeake  in  distinct  ways.  As 
Lorena S. Walsh has shown, at least three clear divisions can be discerned 
in the Chesapeake’s economic geography by the 1680s: the so-called sweet-
scented  counties,  on  the  great  rivers  of  Virginia,  which  produced  a  strain 
of tobacco that was largely consumed by buyers in England; the Oronoco 
regions,  which  produced  a  different  variety  of  tobacco  and  whose  market 
was  mainly  on  the  Continent;  and  the  mixed  agricultural  provisioning 
regions, which produced pork, beef, corn, flour, and grains for both a local 
and a West Indian market.26 The convoy and embargo regime affected all

1730: An Interpretation,” Research in Economic History 5 (1980): 109–77 (quotation, 127). 
The  cap  on  exports  from  the  Chesapeake  in  these  years,  vaguely  associated  with  the 
disruptions of war but never tied to the convoy and embargo regime, was sensed as early 
as 1914 by Margaret Shove Morriss: “Neither the amount exported to England nor that 
sent to the other plantations increased in the years between 1689 and 1715.” See Morriss, 
“Colonial Trade of Maryland, 1689–1715” (Ph.D. diss., Bryn Mawr College, 1914), 35–37 
(quotation, 36).

gy for the Rise of Slavery in Early Virginia,” WMQ  68, no.  3 (July 2011):  332–60, esp.

S.  Walsh,  “Summing  the  Parts:  Implications  for  Estimating  Chesapeake  Output  and 
Income Subregionally,” WMQ 56, no. 1 (January 1999): 53–94. For evidence that West 
Indian provisioning was extremely important to the lower counties of the James River 
by the 1680s, see Bradburn and Coombs,  Atlantic Studies 3: 139–42. The impact of the 
convoy  and  embargo  regime  on  these  provisioning  areas  is  extremely  interesting  but 
beyond  the  scope  of  this  article.  But  if  I  had  space  I  would  emphasize  the  amount  of 
provisioning necessary to sustain the eighty or so warships that participated in convoy 
and  on  station  in  Virginia  throughout  this  period,  not  to  mention  the  merchant  fleet 
itself.  Evidence  from  the  logs  of  the  men-of-war  in  the  Chesapeake  suggests  that  the 
naval demand for provisioning goods—pork, beef, bread, wheat, cornmeal, and peas—
was clearly adequate to cover any aggregate losses from a Caribbean trade disrupted by 
war.  A  typical  fourth-rate  ship  of  the  line,  such  as  the  HMS  Foresight,  which  helped 
protect the tobacco fleet in 1693, had a complement of 226 men and an average capaci-
ty of about six hundred tons. With limited space for provisions, these ships needed to 
begin restocking after six months at sea. The Foresight spent approximately six months in 
Virginia,  a  typical  cruise,  escorting  the  merchant  fleet,  guarding  the  capes,  and  waiting

these regions significantly and in different ways, but concentrating on the 
sweet-scented  tobacco  region  best  reveals  the  transformations  that  would 
most shape Virginia’s future.

For  the  sweet-scented  growing  regions,  the  limits  on  the  size  of  the 
tobacco  crop  imposed  by  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime  furnished  an 
extraordinary  opportunity.  Here,  finally,  was  something  that  various 
groups  in  the  colony  had  been  calling  for  since  the  Navigation  Acts  were 
first imposed: aggressive measures by the state to limit the size of the crop. 
In effect the limit on the tobacco supply caused by the quota regime cre-
ated levels of high prices in England that Virginia planters had been hop-
ing  to  stimulate  through  numerous  ineffective  crop  limitation  schemes 
in  the  1660s,  1670s,  and  1680s.  Laws  governing  when  tobacco  could  be 
planted,  calls  for  voluntary  limits  on  acreage  planted,  attempts  to  create 
an  embargo  on  shipping,  efforts  to  coordinate  a  planting  cessation  with 
Maryland,  and  even  the  desperate  crop  cutting  in  the  mid-1680s  had  all 
failed  to  substantially  increase  the  prices  in  England.27  Even  better,  the 
limits  on  the  crop’s  size  imposed  by  the  war  years  were  subsidized  by  the 
English treasury and protected by the English navy in the name of the pub-
lic good, the wealth of the nation, and the balance of trade. After years of 
resisting the Navigation Act system and all that it implied, Virginia’s lead-
ing planters came to recognize that they needed and could take advantage 
of  imperial  power;  as  they  demanded  assistance  from  the  imperial  state, 
they  were  able  to  capitalize  on  the  limits  placed  on  their  economic  free-
dom. Particular interests, especially the interests of Virginia sweet-scented 
planters, were favored in the name of the common good.

The  evidence  from  the  extant  commodity  price  currents  in  London 
points  to  a  historically  wide  split  between  the  price  of  sweet-scented 
tobacco in the colony and the price offered in London through these years. 
Where  they  can  be  reconstructed  (they  are  notoriously  difficult  to  find), 
prices  on  the  London  market  for  sweet-scented  tobacco  clearly  tended  to 
be  much  higher  than  they  had  typically  been,  at  least  since  the  late 1650s 
(Table I, Figure I). Some of these prices represent the price given on only 
one transaction and therefore cannot be extended to stand for the market 

for the export fleet to assemble. During that time it consumed large quantities of food. 
From  September  1693  to  February  1694,  the  ship  purchased  more  than  ten  thousand 
pounds  of  pork,  nine  thousand  pounds  of  beef,  five  thousand  pounds  of  peas,  eleven 
thousand pounds of bread, and nearly two thousand gallons of beer. See Captain’s Log, 
HMS Foresight, ADM 51/364; Master’s Log, HMS Foresight, ADM 52/35.

27  As  early  as  1662,  Virginians  had  tried  to  limit  the  time  allowed  for  trading 
tobacco in a petition to the Privy Council that was dismissed out of hand. See “Order 
of the Privy Council on petition of the planters and traders to Virginia . . . ,” CO 1/16, 
no. 65. For failed efforts to coordinate cessation with Maryland, see “Lord Baltimore’s 
answer to the representation delivered to his Majesty in Council on the 16th Oct. 1667, 
from  the  Governor  and  Council  of  Virginia,”  CO  1/21,  no.  133;  Report,  CO  1/21,  no. 
140. For later rejections from the customs house, with their reasons, see Custom House, 
Jan. 10, 1681, CO 1/46, no. 84.

price  without  caution,  yet  the  evidence  gathered  from  the  price  currents 
suggests an extremely stable price in any given season. The prices available 
for sweet-scented tobacco during the 1690s were higher than they had been 
for  more  than  thirty  years.  The  mean  low  price  of  sweet-scented  tobacco 
offered in London in 1697, the last year of King William’s War, was more 
than five times the mean low of 1668–69 (two pence) and more than twice 
the  mean  high  of  those  years  (five  pence).  The  highest  high,  of  fifteen 
pence per pound, given at London for York River leaf from April 15, 1697, 
to  June  17,  1697,  commanded  three  times  the  highest  price  listed  on  the 
1660s price currents.28

28 Historians of the Chesapeake economy have concentrated  their  efforts  on  local 
prices,  as  if  these  could  stand  in  for  the  value  of  the  crop  in  Europe.  In  a  completely 
open  and  free  market,  such  attention  to  local  markets  and  the  accompanying  assump-
tion of a convergence, or at least a parallel trend, of colonial and London prices might 
work as a measure of the wealth-generating capacity of the economy, but such a use of 
local  prices  completely  collapses  during  the  period  of  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime 
(about  1690–1715),  when  access  to  participation  in  the  trade  was  regulated  strictly  and 
closed to entry in ways that it had never been and would not be again until the 1740s. 
For the high price given from Apr. 15 to June 17, 1697, see Proctor’s Price Current (Lon-
don,  1697),  April–June.  For  an  extensive  discussion  of  the  commodity  price  currents,

But  to  understand  possible  net  returns,  we  need  to  know  the  impact 
of freight costs. Freight represented the largest drag on a planter’s net pro-
ceeds  for  any  given  sale,  outside  of  customs  duties,  so  we  cannot  assume 
that  higher  prices  in  London  meant  higher  net  proceeds.  Again  the  data 
is  scarce,  but  the  evidence  suggests  that  the  high  prices  for  sweet-scented 
tobacco  offset  the  freight  costs  of  consigners,  costs  that  decreased  as  the 
convoy and embargo regime went into effect. By using a small number of 
extant transactions, we can construct an estimate of the expense per pound 
in any given transaction, taking into account the changing customs duties, 
freight costs, commission fees, cooperage, warehousing, port fees, and other 
transport charges (Tables II–III).

Though the prices found in the court records of actual transactions at 
the  very  beginning  of  the  war  could  not  offset  the  extremely  high  freight 
costs of the first few years of conflict, by the mid-1690s prices available in 
London  would  have  allowed  historic  returns  per  sale  as  the  effects  of  the 
scarcity  of  sweet-scented  tobacco  caused  by  the  quota  system  began  to  be 
felt.  Clearly,  if  the  price  was  high  enough,  the  problem  of  freight  costs 
could  be  overcome.  In  fact  the  prices  available  for  sweet-scented  tobacco 
by the mid-1690s allowed for a higher net return per pound than in the late 
1650s, before the Navigation Acts went into effect, even when that return is 
calculated using an inflated expense-per-pound ratio based on an extremely 
high freight cost of fourteen pounds per ton. What is also clear is that the 
high freight costs, though a product of both tight supply and risk, dropped 
steadily as risk fell. Freight costs spiked at the beginning of the wars but fell 
rapidly in response to the functioning of the convoy and embargo regime, 
while  quantities  exported  from  the  colonies  remained  steady  (Figure  II).29 
By  1697  freight  costs  had  reached  peacetime  levels,  though  the  price  in 
London  remained  very  high.  Within  a  few  years,  the  convoy  system  had 
greatly diminished the risk of long-distance trading.

Anecdotal evidence also shows that some sweet-scented tobacco plant-
ers  expected  extremely  large  returns  by  the  mid-  to  late  1690s.  William 
Fitzhugh,  for  instance,  noted  in  July  1698  that  he  had  ceased  to  produce 
Oronoco  tobacco  for  market  and  that  his  sweet-scented  leaf  received 
prices  as  good  as  the  best  “York  sweet  price.”  Celebrating  the  excellence 
of  his  crop,  Fitzhugh  pointed  out  to  London  merchant  John  Cooper  that 

tigation of the tobacco trade can be found in Jacob M. Price, Perry of London: A Family 
and a Firm on the Seaborne Frontier, 1615–1753 (Cambridge, Mass., 1992), 50–51, table 2. 
Price pulls four prices, from 1676, 1677, 1697, and 1713, from these lists.

29  Note  that  the  freight  rates  of 1692  had  declined 22  percent  by  the  first  convoy 
(the spring) of 1693 (see Table II). Freight rates come from John J. McCusker, “Freight 
Rates  for  Tobacco  from  Maryland  and  Virginia  to  Great  Britain:  1675–1775,”  table 
Eg686–687, in Susan B. Carter et al., eds., Historical Statistics of the United States, Earli-
est Times to the Present, millennial ed. (New York, 2006).

Notes: These numbers represent actual transactions as detailed in the county order 
books.  The  formula  is  simple.  Take  the  total  cost  of  the  transaction  and  divide  it  by 
the pounds of tobacco for sale in that particular transaction. This yields an expense per 
pound,  which,  when  subtracted  from  the  price  per  pound,  provides  a  net  return  per 
pound.  In  looking  at  these  transactions  over  time,  they  are  clearly  compatible,  as  the 
fees for portage, warehousing, commission, etc., represent an extremely small portion of 
the transaction and are all included here in the total expense, with the customs and the 
freight being the most variable.

his  cargo  of  the  previous  year  received  fully  twenty-three  pounds  sterling  a 
hogshead  “clear.”30  Given  that  Fitzhugh  thought  his  hogsheads  were  heavy, 
such  a  return  would  be  the  equivalent  of  between  6.9  and  9  pence  per 
pound, a number roughly consistent with the estimates in Table III.31 Robert 
“King”  Carter,  whose  wealth  would  grow  to  extraordinary  levels  through 
these  years  and  into  the  1720s,  wrote  in  1702  that  “tobacco  hath  held  up 
its  head  for  sevll.  years  together,”  implying  that  the  “seven  Last  Years  get-
tings in Virginia” were uncharacteristically high and warning that the young 
Wormeley  brothers—whose  estate  he  was  managing,  and  who  were  known 
for their high lifestyle—should not expect the next seven to be equivalent.32 
Of  course  Carter  could  not  know  that  favorable  wartime  conditions  for 
sweet-scented tobacco would in fact persist for at least another fourteen years.

Notes:  Two  sets  of  returns  are  presented  here.  Conservative  net  returns  are  based 
on  the  unlikely  and  conservative  estimate  that  the  expense  per  pound  of  tobacco  for 
1697–1702 remained the same as the expense per pound reported in the 1693 sale listed 
in  Table  II,  which  reflected  a  freight  cost  of  £14/ton.  But  as  Table  III  shows,  freight 
rates for the years 1697–1702 (taken from John J. McCusker, “Freight Rates for Tobacco 
from Maryland and Virginia to Great Britain: 1675–1775,” table Eg686–687, in Susan B. 
Carter  et  al.,  eds.,  Historical  Statistics  of  the  United  States,  Earliest  Times  to  the  Present, 
millennial  ed.  [New  York,  2006])  were  much  lower  than  £14/ton.  Therefore  I  have 
calculated  expected  net  returns  based  on  a  lower  estimated  expense  per  pound  due  to 
falling  freight  costs.  Either  way,  substantial—in  fact,  historic—returns  were  possible 
in  sweet-scented  tobacco  in  the  mid-  to  late  1690s  through  1702  and,  I  would  argue, 
through Queen Anne’s War, although the prices are not available. Jacob M. Price, Perry 
of London: A Family and a Firm on the Seaborne Frontier, 1615–1753 (Cambridge, Mass., 
1992), 50, table 2, estimates some returns as averages of a whole tobacco crop (not only 
sweet-scented), which tends to deflate possible returns, and yet for 1697 he has an esti-
mate of 4.1 pence/pound, in line with my conservative hypothetical estimate. Price’s 1697 
estimate is too low, I would argue, because he guesses that the wartime freight cost was 
double  the  peacetime  cost,  or  approximately  £12–13/ton,  whereas  the  evidence  suggests 
that freight was only about 20 percent higher by 1697.

Sources:  Assumed  prices  are  taken  from  Table  I.  Freight  rates  come  from  John  J. 
McCusker,  “Freight  Rates  for  Tobacco  from  Maryland  and  Virginia  to  Great  Britain: 
1675–1775,” table Eg686–687, in Carter et al., Historical Statistics.

bPrice based on the London mean high price as shown in Table I.

During  the  war,  then,  there  were  opportunities  for  net  returns  at  his-
torically high levels in this market for merchants and planter-merchants who 
dealt in sweet-scented tobacco, who bought low and could sell high, and who 
could get their crops included in the shipments. Many millions of pounds of 
sweet-scented tobacco were making it to London, where they were being sold 
at historically high prices. Yet not all Virginia tobacco growers could get their 
crops into the fleet. Anecdotal evidence clearly suggests that thousands, some-
times tens of thousands, of hogsheads of tobacco were left out.

Figure II

Average  freight  rates  for  shipping  Chesapeake  tobacco  to  Great  Britain,  1684–1715.  From 
John  J.  McCusker,  “Freight  Rates  for  Tobacco  from  Maryland  and  Virginia  to  Great 
Britain:  1675–1775,”  table  Eg686–687,  in  Susan  B.  Carter  et  al.,  Historical  Statistics  of  the 
United States, Earliest Times to the Present, millennial ed. (New York, 2006). The spike in 
1708 was no doubt related to the 1707 capture of the outgoing (England to the Chesapeake) 
tobacco  fleet,  including  the  escorts,  numerous  merchant  ships,  and  the  governor  of 
Virginia.

Who  then  had  the  best  opportunity  to  ensure  that  their  tobacco, 
either grown or purchased, would actually become part of the crop sold in 
London?  The  most  obvious  answer  is  those  planters  who  consigned  their 
tobacco  to  the  men  in  London  who  controlled  the  quota  system—the 
planters  with  kinship  ties,  political  relationships,  and  long  histories  with 
the  merchants  who  were  able  to  dominate  the  trade  after  the  convoy  and 
embargo regime went into effect. We know who these men were.

In Virginia the people best poised to take advantage of these wartime 
conditions  were  the  so-called  great  planters  and  their  clients  and  families 
who  had  begun  to  separate  themselves  from  the  merely  successful  local 
planters  by  the  1680s.  The  opportunity  created  by  the  market  in  the  war 
years  accelerated  the  general  trend,  allowing  the  consolidation  of  power 
in the hands of forty or so families that would famously become known as 
“the first families of Virginia.” Emory G. Evans recently published a study 
of  what  he  calls  Virginia’s  “twenty-one  leading  families,”  who  dominated

the  Council  of  State  in  the  late  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries.33 
Putting  Evans’s  map  of  family  seats  onto  Walsh’s  map  of  the  economic 
subregions of the Chesapeake reveals clearly that these families were located 
in the heart of the sweet-scented subregion, where they dominated the local 
offices,  owned  the  most  land,  often  operated  stores,  and  commanded  the 
most labor (Figure III).

These families were well placed to take advantage of the tightly regulated 
and closed market of the war years because they were the most connected to 
the  great  merchants  who  controlled  a  majority  of  the  tobacco  trade  by  the 
mid-1680s. They consigned their tobacco, accepting the risk but getting the 
reward, and they were able to amass tobacco for sale not only because they 
grew  large  amounts  on  multiple  plantation  quarters  but  also  because  they 
received tobacco as fees for the offices they dominated, operated storehouses, 
owned a stake in shipping, speculated on land, or sold slaves to their neigh-
bors. At the very top, the greatest of the great men, such as Lewis Burwell, 
William  Byrd  I,  Robert  “King”  Carter,  Benjamin  Harrison,  Edmund 
Jennings,  Philip  Ludwell,  Daniel  Parke,  William  Randolph,  and  some  oth-
ers, did all these things. Byrd, for example, grew no more than one hundred 
hogsheads of tobacco on his own land in these years, but by the mid-1690s he 
was able to send more than nine hundred to England on his account. From 
the  1690s  the  great  planters  were  able  to  exploit  their  control  of  all  these 
trends,  in  land,  in  the  increasingly  available  supplies  of  enslaved  labor,  and 
in access to the English tobacco market, which created the social, economic, 
and  political  dynamic  that  enabled  their  dominance  during  Virginia’s  so-
called golden age in the early eighteenth century. Put simply, from 1690 to 
1720 the leading families of the colony were able to consolidate their grip on 
the social and political order as a direct result of the wealth-generating oppor-
tunities  created  by  the  convoy  and  embargo  regime—unique  opportunities 
that Virginia would not see again.34

33  Emory  G.  Evans,  A  “Topping  People”:  The  Rise  and  Decline  of  Virginia’s  Old 

Political Elite, 1680–1790 (Charlottesville, Va., 2009), [xii].

34  On  the  economic  activities  of  the  early  founders  of  the  leading  families  of 
Virginia,  see  Evans,  “Topping  People,”  5–22.  For  William  Byrd  I’s  economic  activity, 
ibid.,  13–14.  Though  the  great  planters  were  poised  to  take  advantage  of  the  unique 
constraints  on  the  supply  of  tobacco  to  the  English  market,  it  would  be  foolish  to 
assume  that  they  were  therefore  able  to  simply  lord  it  over  everyone  else.  Firstly,  the 
evidence  suggests  that  while  Virginia’s  great  planters  could  mobilize  a  united  Virginia 
interest  in  London  with  the  aid  of  their  sympathetic  merchant  allies,  they  were  often 
deeply divided themselves by personal politics, by the competition for offices and hon-
ors, and by the struggle to improve their position at the top of the pile. They were an 
ambitious,  jealous  lot.  This  competition  supplied  and  spurred  an  internal  economy 
that  could  be  exploited  by  smaller  planters,  who  were  increasingly  drawn  into  the 
orbits  of  these  greater  planters  as  part  of  their  interest.  Byrd  captures  the  dynamic 
well in many letters to Micajah Perry in the 1680s, making clear that the local planter-
merchants were in competition for the tobacco of other interests. In a typical letter to

and  reminds  the  London  merchants  that  “without  servants  or  slaves,  no  great  crop  is 
now  to  bee  purchased.”  Byrd  to  [Perry  &  Lane?],  Mar.  29,  1685,  in  Marion  Tinling,

great men to patent large amounts of land from the early 1690s allowed them to sell to 
land-hungry men who began developing the last lands available up to the fall line in the 
1690s  and  moving  into  the  Piedmont  after  1700.  That  story,  which  John  C.  Coombs 
and I have begun examining on a small scale in King William County, looks like a story 
of  symbiotic  interests  coming  together.  The  migrant  attempting  to  build  a  farm  and 
the  planter-merchant  and  erstwhile  land  speculator  attempting  to  secure  a  crop  and 
get  a  return  on  his  land  had  a  shared  interest—each  needed  the  other  to  succeed.  See

The  trends  are  evident.  The  only  close  community  study  of  a  sweet-
scented  region  during  this  period,  Darrett  B.  Rutman  and  Anita  H. 
Rutman’s  analysis  of  Middlesex  County,  described  it  from  the  mid-1690s 
through the 1710s as experiencing a “surge of prosperity”—which they could 
not  reconcile  with  the  community  studies  of  Oronoco  counties  in  these 
years—marked  by  rising  indices  of  wealth,  possession  of  luxury  items,  and 
living  standards  throughout  the  county.  They  also  perceived  a  “dramatic 
building surge underway” in the county, with new houses, new additions on 
houses, new churches, and a state-of-the-art courthouse being built in these 
years.35  But  the  Rutmans  also  described  an  accelerating  gap  between  the 
richest families and all the rest. Though the periodizations in their analysis 
do  not  match  up  perfectly  with  the  period  described  here,  it  is  clear  that 
from 1700 to 1719 the wealthiest were pulling away rapidly in Middlesex, an 
outcome that makes no sense if the current orthodoxy about the character of 
the Virginia economy in those years is to be believed (Figure IV).36

Among  the  gentry  and  officeholders  in  Virginia,  it  was  everywhere  evi-
dent  that  many  men  were  not  just  standing  pat  or  struggling  to  maintain 
their standard of living but were amassing great wealth through the 1690s and 
early 1700s. Fitzhugh, for instance, already a large landholder and planter at 
the end of the 1680s, doubled his holdings in land and slaves by the end of 
the  1690s.  In  1690  Carter  already  owned  approximately  six  thousand  acres 
and  one  hundred  slaves—putting  him  in  the  elite  ranks  of  wealth—but  by 
1720 he owned more than a hundred thousand acres of land and upwards of 
four hundred slaves on numerous plantations throughout the colony.

One  of  the  remarkable  transformations  of  Virginia  in  these  years,  of 
course,  was  the  growing  number  of  slaves  as  a  percentage  of  the  overall 
labor force. As John C. Coombs has shown, though the gentry had always 
invested  in  slaves,  the  percentage  of  slave  ownership  by  all  planters  in  the 
sweet-scented  region  grew  very  quickly  during  the  quarter  century  after 
1690. From approximately  50 percent in the  1680s, fully 96 percent of the 
total labor force in the sweet-scented region was enslaved by 1720. Without 
an  awareness  of  the  peculiar  wartime  conditions  of  the  sweet-scented 
tobacco market, earlier historians have struggled to understand these trends. 
How, Gloria L. Main asked famously in 1977, were planters able to invest 
so much money in slaves at a time of declining tobacco prices and general 
depression?37  Within  the  sweet-scented  areas,  the  answer  should  be  clear.

The changing distance between the poorest in Middlesex County and those above them. 
The towers represent the median estate evaluation of each group divided by the median of 
the lowest. Thus, in the period 1650–99, the median of the highest wealth group was forty-
six  times  that  of  the  lowest.  See  Darrett  B.  Rutman  and  Anita  H.  Rutman,  “Wealth,” 
in A Place in Time: Explicatus (New York, 1984), 117–32, for a description of the sample 
and  wealth  groups.  See  also  Rutman  and  Rutman,  A  Place  in  Time:  Middlesex  County, 
Virginia, 1650–1750 (New York, 1984), 189.

There  was  no  paradox.  It  was  not  a  depression  in  Virginia,  and  the  slaves 
were bought and sold by war profiteers in the name of the public good. The 
so-called Virginia golden age was forged in the crucible of war.

But it also should be clear that in this constrained system the growers 
of Oronoco tobacco, the bulk of Maryland planters, were not served well. 
Since  sweet-scented  tobacco  was  largely  consumed  in  England,  the  prob-
lems  of  getting  the  tobacco  to  market  during  the  war  years  stopped  once 
the  convoy  reached  England,  and  the  risk  of  disaster  diminished  with  the 
articulation  of  the  convoy  system.  But  Oronoco  tobacco  was  sold  on  the 
Continent, and the double risk of getting a crop to a European market dur-
ing the war meant that, despite the limits imposed by the quota of shipping 
and the high prices available in Europe, it was extremely difficult for pro-
ducers to offset the problem of freight costs. Efforts by traders in Oronoco 
to get direct access to the Spanish market or find an outlet for the crop in 
Russia at the turn of the century speak to the desperation and crisis in the 
international market for Oronoco tobacco. Europeans began growing their 
own  versions  of  the  cheap  leaf  in  response.  The  market  for  Oronoco  only 
rebounded after the war with a decrease in the British duties on reexported

tobacco and the subsequent growth of French importation beginning in the 
1720s.38 Finally, since the Virginia Council of State ruled the capes of the 
bay, Marylanders played a small role in the articulation of the Chesapeake 
side of the system. They received their orders on sailing times and embar-
goes  from  the  Virginia  council  like  everyone  else.  Robert  Quarry,  who 
famously criticized the operation of the convoy system in  1704 for having 
“done  more  damage  to  trade  .  .  .  than  all  that  were  concern’d  in  it  were 
worth” and “lower’d the price of tobacco both at home and at all forreign 
marketts almost to nothing,” made a specific point of noting, “I mean the 
Aronoco  tobacco.”39  So  the  successes  of  the  tobacco  lobby  in  these  years 
had  an  impact  most  directly  on  the  sweet-scented  regions  of  Virginia. 
Whereas  Virginia  planters  in  those  regions  were  able  to  purchase  slaves 
from  the  rising  supply  in  the  1700s  and  1710s,  planters  in  the  Oronoco 
regions lagged behind. Maryland would not see broad slave ownership—on 
a  par  with  sweet-scented  counties—until  well  into  the  1720s,  when  the 
price of Oronoco recovered.

The great men of Virginia, who conspired with their merchant allies in 
London and elsewhere through the wars to influence the shape of policy, had 
some  telling  successes.  They  successfully  stopped  the  importation  of  bulk 
tobacco.  They  joined  the  wide  mercantile  assault  that  broke  the  monopoly 
of the Royal African Company and encouraged the expansion of the “free” 
trade in enslaved labor.40 Most clearly, they succeeded in creating the func-
tioning  convoy  and  embargo  regime,  the  logistics  of  which  consumed  an

enormous  amount  of  their  time  and  without  which  they  could  not  have 
survived, let alone thrived, during the long stretches of war.

Wartime  royal  governors,  in  this  political  dynamic,  were  often  out 
of  place,  particularly  if  they  attempted  anything  that  distracted  from  the 
convoy  and  embargo  regime.  Gubernatorial  interest  existed  almost  com-
pletely outside the leading concern of the great businessmen, planters, and 
merchants  of  Virginia.  The  governors’  imperial  ambitions,  their  efforts 
to  increase  the  power  of  their  offices  or  themselves,  had  little  to  do  with 
the real purpose of empire as it was understood by the many planters and 
farmers that surrounded them, which was to secure their families’ security 
through  the  pursuit  of  economic  advantage,  social  prestige,  and  politi-
cal  power  in  Virginia.  A  good  example  of  the  divergence  in  the  visions  of 
empire of the Virginia Council of State and a royal governor in these war 
years  can  be  seen  in  the  experience  of  Governor  Francis  Nicholson.  A 
career  jobber  in  the  nascent  imperial  bureaucracy,  Nicholson,  by  the  time 
he  began  his  tenure  as  governor  of  Virginia  at  the  end  of  the  1690s,  had 
already  been  assistant  to  the  governor  of  New  England,  lieutenant  gover-
nor and later governor of New York, lieutenant governor of Virginia, and, 
most recently, governor of Maryland. His plans, as war erupted in the early 
1690s  and  again  in  the  early  1700s,  always  stressed  the  need  for  a  broad 
imperial  perspective.  Virginia  should  guard  its  frontiers,  help  develop  a 
post  office,  reorganize  its  militia  establishment,  prepare  a  ranging  service, 
catalog and collect its arms, help build and maintain roads to the neighbor-
ing colonies, and send money and supplies to New York to fight the French 
in  North  America.  Nicholson  developed  plans  for  a  colonial  union,  called 
for  colonial  cooperation  in  the  prosecution  of  the  war  and  the  conquest 
of  Canada,  and  promoted  the  reorganization  of  the  empire.  But,  with  the 
exception of their support for the College of William and Mary, Nicholson 
found only foot dragging and hostility among the members of his Council 
of  State.  Frustrated  at  every  turn,  Nicholson  began  to  understand  all  his 
problems  as  part  of  an  inherently  provincial  mindset  among  the  Virginia 
elite. Complaining about Virginians, he noted, “The Country consists now 
most of Natives, few of which either have read much or been abroad in the 
world,”  who  could  not  be  “made  sensible  of  the  necessity  of  assisting  his 
Majesty’s Province of New York.”41 They were, he noted in a complaint to 
the Board of Trade, perfect “Creoles.”42

Though  he  was  wrong  about  the  relative  worldliness  of  some  of  his 
critics,  Nicholson  was  right  to  understand  that  these  Virginia  oligarchs 
were concerned first and foremost with Virginia’s trade and saw the empire 
not  with  a  broad  lens  but  with  a  narrow  view  oriented  through  the  capes

of the Chesapeake Bay. As he pointed out, Virginians had little interest in 
the affairs of New York, “tho’ in point of Trade and of Plantation Affairs 
they  are  generally  very  knowing.”43  They  obviously  understood  politics  in 
Whitehall, since they eventually forced Nicholson out of office. They were 
creoles whose perspective of the empire was rooted in Virginia by the late 
seventeenth century. And it was from that vantage point that they had suc-
ceeded in making the empire work for them.

But if these were victories for an emerging Virginia interest and for the 
great families that dominated Virginia more securely than ever by 1715, they 
came with a price. By emphasizing their dependence, neediness, and weak-
ness  and  demanding  the  protection  of  the  navy,  the  Virginia  lobby  had 
adopted a vision of their place and purpose in the empire that would make 
them  not  the  fifth  dominion  of  His  Majesty’s  crown  but  subordinates, 
dependent on British protection, British capital, and British manufactured 
goods.  In  the  1660s,  1670s,  and  1680s,  the  colony  still  bid  defiance  to  the 
Navigation Act system, smuggled openly with the Dutch and the Irish, and 
asked numerous times for a new relationship. By 1715 things had changed. 
Britain  was  developing  a  modern  financial  system  and  beginning  the 
extraordinary transformation into “a polite and commercial people,” while 
Virginia remained as it had been, without financial institutions and at the 
service  of  mercantilism.44  Virginia  existed  to  produce  tobacco,  to  supply 
revenue for the crown, and to consume British manufactures, nothing else. 
The eldest son, Virginia, and the abused stepson, Maryland, were children, 
never  to  grow  up.  They  would  remain  underdeveloped  and,  increasingly, 
politically impotent in London because their best friends in the 1690s and 
early  1700s,  those  great  tobacco  importers  who  could  demand  that  the 
Admiralty  serve  their  particular  interest,  were  more  naturally  the  planters’ 
enemies, which would become clearer as the eighteenth century progressed.
As  we  have  seen,  by  1715  tobacco  merchants  in  London  tended  to  be 
Chesapeake  tobacco  merchants  and  little  else—the  diversity  of  trading 
interests  that  characterized  the  tobacco  sellers  before  the  1690s  was  gone. 
The  more  specialized  the  merchants,  the  more  the  mercantilist  system 
served  them  and  the  more  they  became  dependent  on  its  shape.  London 
merchants  did  not  want  to  compete  with  Europeans  in  the  brokerage  of 
tobacco—they  could  barely  stomach  competing  with  the  Scots—and  so 
their concern was always the maintenance of their special access to tobacco 
grown  in  the  Chesapeake  and  the  continued  underdevelopment  of  the 
Chesapeake  economy.  It  was  the  tobacco  merchants  who  led  the  assault 
on  any  plantation  attempt  to  stimulate  manufacturing  or  diversification, 
who  defeated  the  proposed  reform  of  the  customs  in  the  1730s,  and  who

demanded passage of the 1732 debt act, which put Chesapeake planters’ real 
estate at risk for book debts established by the oath of a British merchant, 
though English property was never so endangered.45 Lamenting the news of 
the debt act, Carter wrote to his old ally Perry of the “tyranny of the mer-
chants”  who  seemed  to  be  “daily  encreasing  their  Oppressions  upon  us.” 
Remembering the “old Adagy that Oppressions make a wise man mad,” he 
wondered “what our Madness will produce.”46

True  to  form,  London  merchants’  special  access  to  the  Chesapeake 
and  their  particular  interest  in  keeping  colonial  plantations  functioning  to 
the merchants’ benefit were justified by appeals to the balance of trade, the 
wealth  of  the  nation,  and  the  public  good.  John  Cary,  the  famous  politi-
cal  economist,  a  common  participant  in  the  politics  of  imperial  design  in 
the  1690s,  and  one  of  the  major  tobacco  merchants  in  this  period  (he 
was  present  at  the  1691  merchant  audience  with  Queen  Mary),  knew  that 
colonies  existed  to  play  a  specific  role.  As  he  noted,  “the  health  of  the 
Commonwealth” of England was always to be preferred to “any part” of the 
plantations  when  they  “set  up  an  interest  alone.”  The  restrictions  on  trade 
were  “Severe  against  such”  plantation  interests,  and  needed  to  be,  because 
the  rules  ultimately  were  intended  not  to  aid  the  colonial  planters  but  “to 
promote  the  happiness  of  our  constitution.”  The  same  “respect  was  due” 
from the plantations, he continued, “as from a Tenant to a landlord.”47

In the wars Virginia had become a colony, a status that became more 
and  more  apparent  as  the  unique  benefits  of  the  market  in  wartime  dis-
appeared. Virginia had lain down with the lion, and the colony would find 
it exceedingly difficult to get up again.

45 Price and Clemens, Journal of Economic History 47: 1–43. The Excise Crisis was a 
well-known episode in Robert Walpole’s administration (1721–42). Steve Pincus argues 
that  Walpole’s  efforts  to  lower  the  land  tax  in  England  with  an  expansion  of  taxes  on 
consumption  were  seen  by  his  Whig  allies  as  a  rejection  of  traditional  Whig  political 
economy in favor of a Tory emphasis on the importance of land. See Pincus, 1688: The 
First Modern Revolution (New Haven, Conn., 2009), 399. For the Virginia opposition to 
the debt act and failed attempt to create an excise tax to replace the customs, see John 
M.  Hemphill  II,  Virginia  and  the  English  Commercial  System,  1689–1733  (New  York, 
1985), 149–287.
