 New World, Real World:
 Improvising English Culture in
 Seventeenth-Century Virginia

 By Cary Carson, Joanne Bowen, Willie Graham,
 Martha McCartney, and Lorena Walsh

 Culture is indivisible from place. Some beliefs, customs, and
 practices can be transplanted from one location to another and come
 through more or less intact. Others are significantly altered by the alien
 conditions they encounter in their new surroundings. The four
 hundredth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown has renewed
 scholars' interest in the transfer of cultures from the Old World and

 their reception and transformation in the New. Those whose starting
 points are Africa, the Mediterranean, northern Europe, and the British
 Isles tend to emphasize how geopolitical realignments and social and
 economic upheavals in places where migrations began set in motion
 events that reshaped societies and restructured economies half a world
 away.1 Those who see the transatlantic movement of peoples and cul
 tures from the receiving end, from the colonies, are often most im
 pressed by the circumstances that challenged the assumptions that
 settlers brought with them and that they began adjusting almost as soon
 as they unpacked their bags. The two viewpoints, taken together, pro
 duce no surprises when they inform us that successful overseas mi
 grants were traditionalists by instinct and improvisers of necessity.

 Where these analytical approaches break new ground is when they

 show how that balance was struck.

 Students of material culture are place-bound more than most schol
 ars. Because archaeological sites and vernacular buildings are rooted in
 the landscape, specialists who study them are best acquainted with the
 destinations where long-distance travelers to North America eventually
 settled. Archaeologists, zooarchaeologists (animal bone specialists),
 folklorists, and architectural historians collect physical evidence in
 those places that should help historians understand important cultural
 adjustments that otherwise are often poorly documented in written
 records. Nowhere is such information about the earliest settlements on

 the American mainland more plentiful than it is in Virginia and
 Maryland, where public and private research organizations have con
 ducted archaeological excavations and architectural surveys for almost
 two generations (see Figure 1). Colonial Williamsburg and the
 National Park Service at Jamestown Island pioneered modern, system
 atic field research beginning in the 1930s; those institutions and others
 have extended the work to the rest of the Chesapeake Bay region since
 1970.2 The sheer volume of material evidence assembled by field
 working historians is nothing less than staggering. The investment of
 time, talent, and funds in collecting this body of new information, not
 to mention the intellectual capital it represents, raises a reasonable
 expectation that scholars from various kindred disciplines were work
 ing together in anticipation of the Jamestown quatercentenary.

 In reality, collaborations have been rare.3 The quantity and

 complexity of archaeological and vernacular building evidence are
 partly to blame. So are material culture specialists themselves. Seldom
 have they gone out of their way to help uninitiated colleagues zero in
 on historical problems that the physical record might usefully inform.
 Archaeological collections are vast archives of raw data. Artifacts
 numbering in the millions can be used to tell many different stories or
 (too often) no story at all, at least not stories that are sufficiently
 original to make notable contributions to a broader understanding of
 the past.

 One promising exception is the interest that many scholars from
 different disciplines now share in the learning process that colonization
 set in motion. As surprising as it sounds, certain groups of artifacts
 recovered from seventeenth-century Chesapeake sites, when skillfully
 interpreted, throw light on some of the make-or-break choices that
 spelled the difference between success and failure for colonists. This
 essay brings to that larger conversation pertinent archaeological evi
 dence of three kinds?animal bones, farm buildings, and the excavated
 remains of Jamestown. Each raises a historical topic that written
 records leave mostly unaddressed. Each tells us something differ
 ent and something worth knowing about the improvising skills of
 European immigrants to the Chesapeake colonies. All three together
 reveal how the experience of place on the margins of empire soon
 overturned customs and practices that had long been central to Britons'
 homegrown way of life.

 Some ideas ship well, and some do not. This essay uses selected
 case studies to look closely at three essential lifeways that colonists
 either had to accept as they found them in Virginia and Maryland or
 had to rebuild from scratch: first, a productive system of agriculture
 suited to the local Native American landscape; then the provision of
 housing for farm owners and their laborers and the farm buildings they
 needed to make a living; and finally the creation of a town where they
 gathered periodically to pass laws and manage commerce. Old World
 experience went only so far in providing newcomers with answers to
 basic questions?what food to grow and livestock to raise, what build
 ings to build first and how, and what manner of urban place to take as
 a model for their capital city. Trial and error replaced received wisdom

 when conventional problem solving proved inadequate. From the very
 beginning, English migrants to the Chesapeake learned to fly by the
 seat of their pants. Archaeologists find evidence of their improvisations
 within ten years of the Virginia colony's settlement in 1607. Choices
 made in that first critical decade played out across the seventeenth
 century in ways that shaped southern agricultural systems, plantation
 management practices, and the planning and building of Tidewater
 towns for decades to come.

 Historians of early America have another reason to pay attention to
 what archaeology has to say about the makeshift inventions that new
 comers patched together to replace their unrealized and unrealistic
 expectations. Much scholarship today takes pains to spell out differ
 ences that distinguished region from region, group from group, town
 from country, men from women, and Africans from Europeans from
 Native Americans. Our commendable eagerness to calibrate and cel
 ebrate the diversity of every people's experience has nevertheless cast
 suspicion on attempts to understand the no less powerful forces that
 began almost immediately to break down the many differences that
 Old World immigrants brought to North America and to colonies
 everywhere.

 Our passion for pluralism has had some unintended consequences.
 First of all, it fails to anticipate or explain the capacity and aptitude for
 nation making that Americans developed in the course of the eigh
 teenth century and demonstrated in founding the republic. As a result,
 much colonial history before the Revolution no longer provides a
 preamble to the national narrative. Second and more fundamentally,
 the luxuriant variety of later American cultures is hard to reconcile
 with the premise that British folkways transplanted to the colonies by
 first-generation immigrants set precedents and established patterns that
 were little affected by their on-the-ground experience or by later ar
 rivals.4 The notion of a founders' hegemony fits poorly with observa
 tions made by dirt archaeologists and social historians who study the
 cultures that settlers and servants from Britain and slaves from West

 Africa brought to the Chesapeake colonies in the seventeenth century.
 These field-working researchers do indeed see evidence that free and
 unfree migrants arrived laden with folk customs that they had learned

 at birth. Once on these shores, though, they encountered and coped
 with an unfamiliar environment, economy, social mix, and labor sys
 tem among many other conspicuous differences. Success, even sur
 vival, in this school of hard knocks required choices, compromises,
 and, most of all, creativity. Sometimes choices had life-or-death con
 sequences, and not just for bondmen and bondwomen. Habits patterned
 and ingrained by long practice in the old worlds from which they came
 were often quickly cast aside in a process of social learning that a
 school of evolutionary anthropologists believes makes better sense of
 the dynamics of cultural change than do the rigid models favored by
 archaeologists and folklorists who work in a structuralist tradition.5
 Today's field-working historians pay particular attention to those real
 world experiences, which, though shared by displaced peoples in a
 variety of settings, nevertheless resulted in very different outcomes.
 We will have more to say about social learning in our summing up.
 First, though, we need to see the social learning process at work in
 early Virginia. The first case study reveals how planters from England
 appropriated a landscape that Indians had managed for centuries and
 how they soon turned it to their own, quite different ends. A second
 describes how homesteaders built farmsteads on the cheap to make
 economical use of their limited start-up capital while getting a foothold
 in the fledgling colony. Finally, a third illustration shows how town
 planners designed and redesigned Jamestown to make the capital city
 a more successful urban place than history has usually acknowledged.
 In each case, the on-site realities of an unfamiliar physical world?a
 world made stranger still by the presence of Indians and, before long,
 Africans?soon pressured English settlers not only to jettison useless
 ideas while holding fast to some things tried and true but also, most of
 all, to extemporize solutions to problems that no one had foreseen.

 Food shortages are episodes in the mythology of early Virginia that
 Jamestown's so-called starving time in the winter of 1609-1610 has

 made legendary. Less well known even to historians is another food
 story. Britons were not the only colonizers whose arrival on the
 Chesapeake scene soon altered the landscape they appropriated from
 the Indians. English farmers imported seeds and livestock in order to
 grow food crops and raise animals for milk and meat. The animals
 themselves were carriers of other aggressive immigrants, species of
 Old World grasses that over millennia had evolved symbiotically
 with Old World grazing animals. All four?farmers, food crops, live
 stock, and weed seeds?soon converted the regional ecology of the
 Chesapeake into a dynamic open-woodland agricultural system that
 was part English, part Indian, part raw nature, and part improvisation.
 This food story is best known to archaeologists.

 Animal bones recovered and studied by archaeologists are called

 faunal remains. They contain information that tells zooarchaeologists
 how domesticated animals played a central part in transforming the
 Chesapeake environment from the moment of their introduction. While
 conventional written records address many important aspects of agri
 culture and animal husbandry, documents tend to reflect the agendas of
 their authors and thus are always subject to interpretation. Faunal re
 mains are different. Being nothing more than leftover table scraps, they
 avoid a writer's biases. They simply record the diet and tastes of
 individual diners at the tables that produced the discarded material.
 Zooarchaeologists have assembled a broad dietary record pertaining to
 wealthy and middling planters and, frequently, enslaved Africans as
 well. The data provide an invaluable (but seldom used) independent
 source of information to test the truth of information from historical

 records. Furthermore, because faunal remains supply data of an alto
 gether different kind, they extend our knowledge of early foodways to
 subjects and regions that otherwise remain undocumented.6

 Zooarchaeological research carried out over the last thirty years by
 Historic St. Mary's City in Maryland and Colonial Williamsburg in
 Virginia has assembled data from more than a hundred sites. They date
 from 1607 through the early nineteenth century and include dozens of
 deposits from Jamestown Island and other lower Chesapeake locations.

 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY

 The faunal database is now sufficiently comprehensive to provide in
 formation essential to identifying regional trends and understanding
 long-term change. Where individual sites have produced insufficient
 numbers of bones to generate statistically reliable data, sites have been
 combined to form broader analytical groups: 1620-1660, 1660-1700,
 1700-1750, and the third and fourth quarters of the eighteenth cen
 tury.7 Written records have not been ignored in this work. Documents
 speak to archaeologists in some ways that bones cannot. They deepen
 our understanding of the faunal evidence by stating or implying peo
 ple's reasons for the behavior that created the archaeological record.
 The analysis offered here draws on the strengths of both kinds of
 evidence, letting each inform the other.

 Data derived from faunal collections provide primary evidence for
 studies of the living landscape. For this work zooarchaeologists use
 two analytical tools principally. One, the so-called dietary estimate,
 uses mathematical equations to convert bone counts to estimated meat
 weights for wild and domesticated species. Analysts can thereby com
 pare colonists' dependence on local fish and game as food sources with
 the domesticated animals they brought with them from home.8 Mea
 suring excavated assemblages of meat and fish bones consumed and
 thrown away by early settlers is one way to gauge their initial encoun
 ter with New World wildlife. Inferential information derived from the

 measurement of bones?the second useful analytical tool?reveals
 long-term changes in the environment in which domesticated animals
 were raised. Long bones (i.e., leg bones) are indicators of the size
 attained by mature cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.9 Growth in the
 mammalian skeleton is affected by many factors, including breeding

 8 Biomass measures the amount of flesh represented by the weight of the archaeological bone.
 See Elizabeth J. Reitz and Elizabeth S. Wing, Zooarchaeology (Cambridge, Eng., 1999), 225-31.
 9 Since no faunal assemblage recovered from North American sites contains sufficient num
 bers of measurable long bones to estimate size changes occurring on a single site, all fused
 epiphyseal ends of long bones from every site were used to assess regional patterns. In all,
 twenty-six different measurements from a sample of seventeen hundred individuals were taken
 using standard values published in Angela von den Driesch, A Guide to the Measurement of
 Animal Bones from Archaeological Sites (Cambridge, Mass., 1976). See also Benjamin Arbuckle,

 and to a large extent the environmental conditions in which animals
 grow up. Biologists agree that in circumstances where animals are
 turned loose to forage for food, as was the case in the Chesapeake
 colonies, nutrition trumps all other factors contributing to animal size.
 Those that eat well reproduce freely and achieve their full genetic
 potential. Alternatively, in situations where they are deprived of nu
 tritious foods owing to inferior forage or competition from other ani
 mals, growth is stunted, particularly in the developmental stages of
 young mammals.10 Together these two analytical techniques?
 consumption estimates and bone measurements?help archaeologists
 determine how early settlers from England tried to feed themselves on
 their first coming to the Chesapeake colonies and later how their suc
 cessors learned to adjust English herding and horticultural practices to
 take better advantage of the region's natural resources.

 The founders of Jamestown were astonished by the profusion of
 wildlife in America. Even so, their colony nearly starved to death. The
 reasons are many (and often recited), but the paradox owes much to the

 fact that the soldiers, artisans, and merchants sent over to garrison and
 operate a Virginia Company trading station expected others to supply
 them with provisions?either the investors back home or their intended

 Indian trading partners in the colony.11 The colonists themselves were
 well qualified for the jobs they came to do, which meant that most were
 not experienced farmers and few had hunting skills. Little wonder that
 they dragged their feet when ordered to start growing their own corn.
 Likewise, traders and artisans were reluctant to venture into the sur

 rounding forests to hunt game. To make matters worse, the entire mid
 Atlantic seaboard was locked in the grip of a severe, decade-long
 drought when the English expedition reached Virginia.12 A string of
 failed crops all but wiped out surplus food supplies, which the Powhatan
 Indians grudgingly traded to the English during the few interludes
 when the two were at peace. The terrible winter famine of 1609-1610

 had been a disaster waiting to happen. The wretched survivors, indeed

 the settlement itself, were rescued only when reinforcements arrived in

 the spring.13 The infamous starving time proceeded from a huge tac
 tical miscalculation involving the supply of essential foodstuffs.

 Faunal remains recovered from the Jamestown Fort site put hard

 numbers to the story that survivors told of their dependency on easy
 to-catch wildlife and dwindling food supplies imported from home (see
 Figure 2).14 Various fish, wild fowl, turtles, and small mammals
 counted for half of all meat remains in the fort assemblage and clearly
 were the mainstay of the colonists' diet. In the winter of 1609, when
 they could not or dared not leave the fort, they literally ate anything
 that moved. Faunal remains from those months include creatures sel

 dom if ever eaten by Europeans, including vipers, black rats, musk
 turtles, dogs, cats, and most poignantly horses. Normally horse bones
 are not found in garbage dumps; horse meat, usually taboo to all but
 very poor people, was eaten by others only in extremis. Furthermore,
 horses were too scarce and too valuable to put into a stew pot in
 ordinary times.15 The fact that heavily butchered horse bones taken
 from heads, feet, and carcasses account for 12.2 percent of the total
 biomass recovered from early deposits within the fort bears witness to
 the colonists' desperate straits. Apparently horses were the only large
 animals they had brought from England. Although Thomas Gates re
 putedly imported livestock in 1608, the faunal evidence strongly im
 plies that the animals he transported included no cows or steers. Cattle
 bones do number among the bone assemblages from the fort, fully 14
 percent of the biomass, but significantly they include no heads or feet.
 So, beef must have come from barreled provisions?as long as they
 lasted, which was not long enough.16

 Virginians overcame the food shortage crisis only when they rec
 ognized that the time and energy spent producing commodities for sale
 had to be balanced with food production. The trading station model
 was hard to scrap. After it became clear that the Powhatan Indians had

 no intention of keeping Jamestown's common store replenished, Sir

 Thomas Dale first tried to turn his artisans and agents into farmers by
 martial law and, when that did not work, by assigning each man a
 three-acre garden allotment.17 Although some settlers claimed that
 they could grow as much food as they needed by 1616, the turnaround
 came a few years later when Governor George Yeardley finally ac
 knowledged that agriculture was the colony's main chance. He set
 Virginia on a new course by granting headrights to investors who were
 willing to transport farmworkers to Virginia as indentured servants.
 Immediately planter-entrepreneurs set up independently owned and
 operated farmsteads where they began growing foodstuffs for them
 selves and a strain of tobacco popular on the European market. Only
 then was the colony able to provision itself.18

 But the colonists' methods were not what immigrant English farm
 ers had been accustomed to at home. To their eyes the landscape that
 greeted their arrival in Virginia in 1607 appeared to mimic nature itself
 despite the obvious presence of native cultivators. The resemblance
 was owing to the fact that Indian farmers were horticulturalists in the
 sense that anthropologists use that term, that is, agriculturalists who

 raise several crops simultaneously on a single patch of ground, using a
 canopy of taller plants to provide shade, conserve water, and inhibit the
 growth of weeds. Powhatan farmers cleared the forests by girdling
 trees and burning the undergrowth. They planted multiple crops on
 hills hoed up among the dying trees and decaying stumps?tall corn
 stalks shading lower-growing beans and squash. Slash-and-burn hor
 ticulture enriched the soil with ash for the first few years before its
 fertility began to decline. The Powhatan eventually abandoned the
 worn-out fields and cleared more forestland. Over time this practice
 created a mixed yet natural-looking landscape composed of hardwood
 and pine forests alternating with a patchwork of villages, fields under
 cultivation, and older ones abandoned.19

 Colonists were unacquainted with slash-and-burn agriculture. For
 millennia British farmers had mixed cultivation of plants with raising
 stock. They used plows to till fields and pastured livestock on grass
 lands and harvested fields in order to manure the ground.20 Neither
 practice was immediately practical in the Chesapeake colonies, a re
 gion without fences or natural barriers to corral grazing animals. So,
 making do, the earliest English farmers simply inserted themselves and
 their livestock into the native landscape. Slashing and burning in In
 dian fashion, they converted forestland into stump-studded fields to
 grow tobacco for the market and corn for themselves. Also like the
 Indians, they abandoned exhausted fields after yields declined and
 repeated the cycle by clearing more uncultivated land.

 Cattle were introduced into this new landscape as early as 1611. At
 first, planters built palisades across peninsulas from river to river to
 protect their herds from wolves and Indians. As the threat from preda
 tors gradually diminished, the English colonists discovered that it was
 more efficient to fence animals out, not in. Laws passed in 1632 and
 1646 required farmers to enclose fields and orchards against livestock
 that otherwise was left to forage freely in abandoned fields, woodlands,
 and marshes.21 Immigrant settlers remembered herding methods

 still practiced in wood-pasture regions of the British Isles. Some
 historians have supposed that this sensible solution transferred to the
 Chesapeake colonies amounted to no system at all, with the only con
 trol seeming to be the exclusion of animals from cultivated fields and
 orchards. Biologists suspect not. They know that farmers must have
 controlled foraging animals some other way, for when animals are
 allowed to run totally free, they turn feral.23 References to "heards of
 wilde cattle" tell us that feral animals were recognizably different and
 regarded as a nuisance when they kept "Company with their tame
 Cattle."24 But Chesapeake stockmen had practical ways of dealing
 with the problem and maintaining control over their foraging herds.
 They understood animal behavior from long experience.

 Domesticated animals are social by nature. Because, like humans,
 they live in hierarchical groups, they easily accept humans as their herd
 leaders. Early records leave no doubt that colonists understood the
 instinctive social behavior of both swine and cattle and used that

 knowledge to develop a herding system that protected and nourished
 their animals. When left on their own, cattle live in herds composed of

 females and their young.25 Colonists knew from experience that groups
 of cows and calves could be found and fairly easily rounded up if they
 prevented the animals from wandering too far afield by palisading
 necks of land. A traveler through the region in 1687 observed that

 planters' cattle grazed behind these barriers "in the woods or on the
 untilled portions of their plantations, where they seek shelter nightly
 rather by instinct than from any care given them."26

 Pigs are social animals no less than cows. Turned loose, they too

 live in herds of sows and piglets. Only adult boars roam solo (except
 during rut season).27 Chesapeake planters allowed swine to run in the
 woods more than any other species. They could be protected fairly
 easily from animal predators and Native American hunters by confin
 ing them on islands or corralling them on narrow peninsulas. There
 they swarmed "like Vermine upon the Earth." But they never strayed
 very far. Robert Beverley acknowledged this essential herd instinct
 when he remarked in 1705 that, if "the Proprietor can find and catch

 the Pigs, or any part of a Farrow," then he could claim ownership of all
 that ran together, because, Beverley noted, "they are bred in Company,
 so they continue to the End."28 Furthermore, because swine are sed
 entary as long as there are ample food supplies nearby, colonists could
 rest assured that their sows and yearlings were unlikely to wander long
 distances through the forest.29 The herding system based on these
 expectations closely resembled an older form of pig raising, known in
 England as pannage husbandry, where pigs were birthed at home,
 weaned, and then pastured in forests.30

 During the first few years of settlement, the Virginia Company
 periodically augmented the small inventory of cattle in the colony with
 additional animals transported from England. Those shipments ceased
 after 1624. From then on, herds grew by natural reproduction alone. A
 census taken in 1619 counted five hundred head of cattle and already
 more pigs than anyone could reckon. Thirty years later cattle had

 increased forty-fold, to twenty thousand, and other livestock flourished
 proportionately: five thousand goats, three thousand sheep, two hun

 dred horses, fifty asses, "innumerable" swine, and poultry "without
 number."31 Faunal remains corroborate the documentary evidence that
 the herd system that developed in the Chesapeake lessened planters'
 dependence on fish and game. Relative dietary estimates show that the
 consumption of meat from domesticated animals increased rapidly in
 the period 1620-1660 (see Figure 3). Beef consumption rose from 14
 percent to as much as 58 percent by the third quarter of the century,

 followed by pork and mutton.32 Englishmen returned to meat eating as
 soon as circumstances allowed.

 The landscape on which European immigrants settled in the
 Tidewater region provided rich feeding grounds for livestock. Wood
 lands were the original hog heaven, full of longleaf mast, tender roots,
 and carrion; pigs found roots and oysters in the salt marshes. Cattle
 gathered along streams and shorelines where marsh grasses flourished,
 especially in springtime when animals were undernourished.33 Wood
 lands, wetlands, and abandoned fields provided vines, broad-leaved
 trees, and the young shoots of hardwood trees. Cattle thrived in this
 environment. Unusually long leg bones recovered from archaeological
 sites located on the Lower Peninsula between the James and York

 Rivers prove that adult animals were routinely growing to larger sizes
 by the last quarter of the seventeenth century (see Figure 4). More
 abandoned fields in the longer-settled parts of the region meant more
 forage with high nutritive value. Whether farmers recognized the ben
 efits or not, the horticultural cycle they followed in the region?from
 tobacco to corn to fallow fields?created near-perfect foraging condi
 tions for cattle.34 And vice versa. Cattle were colonizers in their own

 seeds stowed away on their hooves and in their stomachs had co
 evolved with herbivores for thousands of years. When imported,

 European-born cattle dropped manure, they inadvertently spread the
 Old World grasses that contained certain essential proteins that New
 World grasses lacked.36 Little by little, herbivores and grazing
 resistant plants restarted the process of coevolving in the New World.
 This balance did not last. Something began to happen to the agri
 cultural environment in the region along the James River in the first

 they had during the first half of the seventeenth century. The expla

 cropping scrub fields and shortened fallow periods on their best soils.
 Other events further limited what had been the exceptionally plentiful
 and nutritious diet for cattle. A sustained fall in tobacco prices after
 1680 first encouraged planters to expand production, but, as the re
 sulting glut of inferior tobacco depressed prices still further, many
 growers diversified, adding small grains and expanding corn produc
 tion. As a market crop, corn required plowing, and plowed fields could
 be planted over and over again with wheat after corn yields dimin
 ished.37 Faunal evidence demonstrates that cows and steers no longer

 feeding corn shucks to free-ranging livestock as a fodder supplement
 from the 1690s onward.38

 Once planters began plowing fields and growing grains, the stubble
 fields that reapers left behind after each harvest produced an ideal
 environment for a relative newcomer to the Chesapeake scene?sheep.
 Again, planters adjusted their stock mix accordingly. Among his ob
 servations on Virginians' farming practices in 1687, Durand de
 Dauphine noted that they had recently begun running flocks of sheep
 on harvested wheat fields along with horses and cattle.39 Simulta
 neously, bounty hunters mounted an all-out attack on sheep-killing
 wolves.40 While mixed-species grazing can benefit pastures as well as
 animals in the short run, the presence of too many animals, or over
 grazing by a few, reduces the hardiness of plants and can lead even
 tually to their disappearance. The introduction of sheep, coming on top
 of growing populations of other grazing animals, hastened the wear
 and tear on pasturage on the Lower Peninsula, thereby reducing soil
 fertility and, with that, the health and weight gain of cattle.41

 Planters saw for themselves that overgrazing degraded their live

 stock even if they did not fully understand how it happened. Robert
 Beverley blamed careless farm management for the sickly condition of
 herds in Virginia as early as 1705: "by which means," he wrote, "they
 starve their young Cattle, or at least stint their growth; so that they
 seldom or never grow so large as they would do, if they were well
 manag'd." Landon Carter made the same connection between poorly
 managed rangeland and undernourished animals after inspecting his
 land and livestock in 1770: "I ha[ve] seen every patch but the
 meadow .... But nothing grows and creatures are yet poor. The lambs
 not filled, the Ewes very spindly, and the Cows with young calves [are
 pitifully] thin."42 Over time, mixed-species grazing intensified the
 damage to woodlands and marshland no less than it did to fallow fields.
 Cattle in large numbers could effectively defoliate hardwood forests

 during the summer months, and in wintertime, it was observed, they
 "delight much to feed" in the luxuriant salt marshes.43 Pigs wreaked
 another kind of havoc. A single animal could consume thirteen hun
 dred pounds of acorns in just six months. Feeding like rototillers, pigs
 destroyed tree roots, seedlings, and underground tubers. Hungry swine
 stripped bark from trees in search of insects.44 Little by little, a herding
 system that had flourished as long as planters maintained a balance
 between animals and resources began breaking down as that equilib
 rium was upset.

 The faunal evidence leaves no room for doubt: the era of freewheel

 ing innovation was nearing an end, and the transformation of the
 Chesapeake landscape was entering a new age. By 1700 horticultural
 practices that immigrant farmers had adopted to cope with the frontier
 environment had so altered the condition of the soil that their descen

 dants had no choice but to make further adjustments. Pigs still roamed
 freely through the woodlands, as did many cattle and horses, but in
 ever-smaller numbers. Planters' use of plows carved up the older,
 informal, tobacco landscape into well-defined fields for grain crops,
 which stood separate from enclosed pastures where herds of horses and
 cattle and flocks of sheep grazed together, no longer free to forage
 abroad. In the matter of food production, the learning curve had gradu
 ally spiraled back on itself over the course of a hundred years. In the
 next case study, it did not.

 Crops, animals, and the labor to grow and care for them were more
 or less fixed expenses for a start-up planter in Virginia, but not so his
 farm buildings and his farmhouse. Back home, the necessary structures
 to store crops, shelter livestock, quarter servants and farmhands, and
 house a husbandman's family often passed from generation to genera
 tion by inheritance. In the colonies, every new settler on every new
 frontier had to start from scratch. Fencing, housing, and barn raising
 required significant out-of-pocket expenditures, but there were short
 cuts that beginners could take to hold these discretionary costs down
 and so save precious resources for land, labor, and other necessities.

 pentry methods that immigrants brought with them from whatever

 region had been home, newcomers replicated those, borrowed new
 ideas from each other, or learned to use the country's prodigious timber
 supplies to invent still other half-measures, always to the same pur
 pose?to save time and money until they got their plantations up and
 running. Eventually most farmhouses and work buildings were rebuilt
 using longer-lasting materials and more workmanlike construction
 techniques. By then, though, the much improvised "Virginia house"
 had so thoroughly altered prevailing carpentry practices in the region
 that vernacular buildings never again resembled their British progeni
 tors or functioned in quite the same way. Architectural historians have
 pieced together this lost account of Virginia's earliest homesteads
 largely from evidence supplied by archaeologists.

 Excavators have recovered information about more than three hun

 dred structures from seventeenth-century sites in Maryland and Vir
 ginia. Historians can now use this large dataset to ask how and when
 Britons adapted imported technologies to the unfamiliar circumstances
 they encountered in the Chesapeake colonies and how they eventually
 solved their everyday needs for serviceable, affordable dwellings and
 farm buildings.45

 Excavations still in progress at the original 1607 fort on Jamestown
 Island have brought to light structures that literally open the story of
 building technology in British North America. Three buildings con
 structed on skimpy frames encased inside earthen walls were erected in
 the first one or two years following the initial landing; a fourth build
 ing, a rowhouse, also timber framed but standing on light masonry
 footings, was very likely one of the new houses built "in and about
 James Town" in 1610-1611 (see Figure 5).46 These four present-at
 the-creation buildings establish beyond reasonable doubt that the
 technology used in their making represents contemporary English prac
 tice transplanted directly to the New World. Too little time had passed
 for experimentation to produce new forms.47 Yet, easy as it is to
 assume that these earliest of all structures were English born and bred,

 their antecedents have been hard to locate. Generally speaking, their
 ancestry appears to claim kinship to the lightly framed dwellings that
 were common to medieval peasants' dwellings, structures frequently
 raised on slight frames sandwiched inside clay or earthen walls.48 No
 less an authority than Captain John Smith recorded that the first semi
 permanent church at Jamestown, built in 1608, was "a homely thing
 like a barne, set upon Cratchets [forked poles], covered with raft[ers],
 sedge [reeds], and earth; so was also the walls."49 Smith's description
 applies just as accurately to the three buildings along the outer walls,
 buildings whose structural posts were so haphazardly aligned that they
 could not have been covered with boards. Instead, as excavated lumps
 of clay suggest, they too were earth walled.50

 The salient feature of the three earliest structures inside James Fort

 is the subsurface remains that archaeologists find when they excavate
 the sites of such buildings: soil stains left by upright posts that were set
 into postholes to give the frame rigidity. Post-in-the-ground or "earth
 fast" buildings (as they have come to be called) have been discovered
 throughout the Chesapeake region. Variations on this economical con
 struction technique remained in common use into the eighteenth cen
 tury. Over the course of the seventeenth century, newcomers and
 seasoned colonists alike relied on one or another earthfast construction

 method for houses, barns, and frequently even public buildings.51 The
 earliest buildings resembled those that immigrant carpenters remem
 bered from home. Later a process of trial and error produced brand
 new variations inspired by the abundance of American timber.

 Archaeologists working in Maryland and Virginia have recorded
 evidence of both types?both the trials and the hybrids. Often it is
 difficult to tell which methods carried over from traditional practice
 and which were experiments. Excavators have found examples of pit
 houses, houses with earthfast wall posts standing on subsurface floors,

 clay-walled structures with no supporting framework below the eaves,

 New World invention. The fort buildings at Jamestown, dating a decade earlier, now turn an
 educated guess into solid fact.

 raftered buildings that were literally all roof and no walls, mud-clad
 cottages variously infilled with wattle-and-daub applied to wickerwork
 panels or a mixture of clay and plaster laid up on vertical staves
 mud-and-stud style, and, at the other extreme, carefully carpentered,
 timber-frame structures with sills laid directly on the ground or even
 with masonry footings used in combination with earthfast posts.52
 After preparing the timbers on the ground, some builders raised a
 post-in-the-ground house or barn frame starting at one end and working

 to the other, pairs of posts set up in sequence one after another; others

 preferred to assemble an entire side wall lying flat and then lift it into

 place all at once. Each of these techniques left traces in the ground that
 skilled excavators can recognize and differentiate three centuries later
 (see Figure 6). While none was to become the perfect answer to every
 Chesapeake builder's needs, the sheer number and variety of tech
 niques employed in the first fifty years testify to homesteaders' deter
 mination to learn by trial and error which methods and materials
 worked better than others.53

 On occasion newly arrived colonists bypassed the usual shortcuts in

 favor of a proper "English framed house" with full masonry founda
 tions, continuous sills, and an expensively carpentered timber frame.
 Thomas Cornwaleys, a prominent leader in the Maryland colony, had
 such a house in mind when he explained in 1638 that "/ am building

 hygh, with A sellar and Chimnies of brick, toe Encourage others toe

 quantity made no practical sense in a place where the forests held
 inexhaustible supplies of framing timbers and rivable clapboards. Raw
 materials were cheap. It was the skilled labor?to burn bricks, saw

 higher in Virginia. To most newcomers, therefore, it stood to reason
 to build as inexpensively as possible at first, until they could get their
 feet on the ground. Anything more lavish, even by those who could
 afford more, was deemed "sillie" and "vnnecessarie." Those were the

 carefully chosen words that John Smith used to describe a "pallas in
 the woodes" that no less a person than John Ratcliffe, president of the
 Council of Virginia, set about building at Jamestown?"to fulfill his
 follies," Smith added?after having squandered the colony's precious
 stores.57 Smith's reproach went to the heart of the lesson that every
 new arrival needed to learn: that extravagance, particularly extravagant
 building, put an entire enterprise at risk, be it a brand-new plantation
 or, as at Jamestown in 1608, the colony itself. A later pamphleteer
 distilled the wisdom of what was by then long experience: "ordinary
 beginners," he wrote, are strongly advised that "a mean way of
 Building" is "sufficient and safest" at the start.58

 What mean ways of building eventually proved to be sufficient for
 beginners? Archaeologists and architectural historians have concluded
 that Chesapeake carpenters ultimately selected for further development

 two strands from the many English building traditions they tested in the
 first three or four decades of settlement. They combined them to create
 what thereafter became known as the Virginia house, a shorthand term

 for a highly successful, hybrid building system that spread throughout
 the region (see Figure 7).

 The two starting points were the close-studded box frame and a
 system of ephemeral timberwork that British architectural historians
 now call "slight framing." The English box frame was a construction
 of vertical and horizontal timbers?posts, sills, plates, and beams?
 jointed and pegged together and often braced at the corners. This
 self-supporting structure, usually raised high and dry on a masonry
 foundation, was strong enough to hold up a framework of roof trusses
 that rested on top of it but that was not integral to the house frame
 underneath. There were many ways to assemble a box-frame building.
 One?close-studding?seems to have developed as the standard way
 of structuring buildings in those parts of Britain where the practice of

 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY

 timber framing remained dominant into the seventeenth century.
 Close-studding began as a conspicuously expensive way to embellish
 a half-timbered house by installing closely spaced (and structurally
 redundant) vertical studs between heavier wall posts. By the
 seventeenth century, carpenters tended to spread the studs farther apart,

 use smaller scantling, beef up the corner bracing, and increasingly hide
 the building's skeleton underneath cladding of one kind or another.59
 The box-frame model with secondary studs offered Chesapeake

 builders two advantages. First, it was made to order for a region rich
 in timber; and, second, by treating the carcass and the roof separately,
 one frame placed on top of the other, it was ripe for further develop
 ments that soon followed from this abundant wood supply. That said,
 box frames also came with two disadvantages: their many pieces re
 quired complicated joinery to put them together and were therefore
 time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, heavily carpentered
 frames had to be raised off the ground, usually on masonry footings, to
 prevent rotting. Brickmason-work was never cheap. That is where the
 second technology?slight framing?came into play. Builders of
 wattle-and-daub and mud-clad cottages (such as those at James Fort)
 treated light scantling more as a scaffold than as a load-bearing frame.
 Uprights embedded inside clay walls acted as fasteners for the wattles
 or staves to which the wall covering itself, mud or plaster, was then
 applied. Additionally, the uprights in slight-frame buildings were often
 earthfast and, therefore, required no foundation.60

 Colonists soon learned that slight framing, besides being quick and
 easy, saved money, especially if, by borrowing and adding elements
 from the box-frame tradition, they could replace clay walls with a
 substitute wall covering made of wooden boards. By midcentury,
 Chesapeake carpenters merged the two technologies into an amalgam
 ated system that combined simplified joinery, earthfast construction,
 and cladding for roofs and walls made from short lengths of split oak
 or chestnut clapboards, sometimes weatherproofed with a coating of
 pine tar. The resulting Virginia house answered most colonists'

 other ornamental framing styles often relied on middle rails to break the lengths of studs, in part
 because timbers of long lengths were increasingly becoming difficult to obtain. Conventional
 close-studding did not. Common seventeenth-century framing of the type that inspired that in the
 Chesapeake omitted horizontal rails as principal framing members.

 requirements for dwellings, outbuildings, tobacco barns, warehouses,
 courthouses, and even churches. Its design was a masterful solution to
 the typical homesteader's?the "ordinary beginner's"?need to man
 age his risks. It was indeed "a mean way" to fabricate and assemble the
 parts of a timber frame, skin the skeleton quickly and cheaply, and
 provide hearth and heat for a dwelling house at considerably less
 expense than making and burning a kiln-load of bricks for a chimney.
 Chimneys, too, were wooden affairs?timber framed, parged with clay
 for fireproofing, and weatherized with the same riven boards used to
 cover walls and roofs. Clay became a vestigial material relegated to
 chimney linings and floor surfaces and occasionally packed into walls
 behind clapboards and under eaves, crannies that needed protection
 from the weather. The framing timbers in the Virginia house were
 minimally prepared, either by hewing or splitting or by simply peeling
 the bark off logs. Box-frame joinery was reduced to basics. Simple lap
 joints, secured with nails, saved time and money compared with
 mortise-and-tenon joints, which required laying out, pr?fabrication,
 and careful fitting together. Raising frames in sidewall units became
 the preferred assembly method because it helped simplify joints at
 plate level (see Figure 6B).61 With no bricks to fire or boards to saw
 and less effort required to dress a timber frame and split clapboards to
 sheathe it, a Virginia house could be erected in a matter of weeks,
 leaving sodbuster-planters more time and resources to spend on other
 pressing needs.

 More than anything else, the use of riven clapboards triggered the
 rapid development of building technology in the Chesapeake colonies.
 The clapboard was a strong, lightweight, tapered slat, which was split
 (rived) quickly and easily from straight-grained white oak or chestnut
 timbers that had been precut into standard lengths (see Figure 8). The
 board's thin upper edge and feathered ends (cut with two strokes of
 a drawknife) made it easy to overlap with adjoining clapboards to
 form a tight, light, durable surface, which was nailed to the framing
 members underneath. The costs for imported nails and semiskilled
 American labor were not negligible, but clapboards?like plywood
 today?opened carpenters' eyes to other economizing innovations.
 Clapboard work superseded mud walls, half-timbering, and other tra
 ditional walling materials used to enclose and weatherproof buildings

 on the exterior, and it also became the preferred alternative to thatch
 and tiles as an economical roof covering. The full potential of clap
 boards took several decades to recognize and develop. Eventually
 planters also used them to sheathe interior partitions, lay attic floors,
 encase wooden chimney frames, and nail up as fence pales. Documents
 mention them frequently only after midcentury, although archaeologi
 cal evidence of ever more regular building frames in the 1640s and
 1650s suggests a growing acceptance that appears to coincide with the
 emergence of the Virginia house.

 Indeed, the two more than just coincide. Clapboards were the com
 ponent that defined the Virginia house and made it affordable. The
 standard five-foot clapboard was the inspiration for a modular framing
 system that builders could expand or contract to suit their needs. Re
 gardless of the intended function, buildings were generally laid out in
 a series of ten-foot bays, each two boards long. Ranks of overlapping
 clapboards were nailed to lightweight riven studs (borrowed from the
 slight-frame tradition), which were set out on two-and-a-half-foot cen
 ters between heavier, load-bearing posts (from box-frame work) that
 formed each bay. The secondary studs were, in essence, scaffold
 needed simply to carry the clapboard sheathing.

 As a matter of fact, clapboards gave buildings more rigidity than the
 studs did. That function is seen most clearly in the Chesapeake roof
 frame, specifically the development of a distinctive truss design. Roofs
 in England were variously raised on a framework of principal and
 secondary rafters, heavy, lengthwise-running, connecting beams called
 purlins, and braces?all fitted together often using complex and so
 phisticated carpentry joints. Roof coverings of clay tiles, stone and
 slate shingles, and even thatch were tremendously heavy and thus
 required strongly built roof trusses for support. By contrast, lightweight
 clapboards made the problem go away. They freed Chesapeake build
 ers to invent an inexpensive roof frame constructed entirely of common
 rafters, paired into trusses and joined by a collar beam that was simply
 lapped and nailed in place. The rafters themselves could be very small
 dimensioned timbers, sometimes no more than two inches square in
 cross section. Still they adequately spanned buildings sixteen or eigh
 teen feet wide. Without braces or connecting purlins, such rafter pairs
 were not stable enough to stand upright by themselves. Only the clap
 board covering provided the diaphragm action that gave a finished roof
 frame its structural rigidity. In other words, clapboards did double duty
 both as the roof covering and as the bracing system that held the roof
 aloft, all at a fraction of the cost of roofs in England that relied on
 heavy timbers, complex joints, and sawn lumber applied as underlay
 ment on which to hang tiles or slates. Clapboard work in the southern
 colonies was the ingenious matchmaker that arranged a marriage be
 tween earthfast slight framing and box construction, a union so close
 that the terms Virginia house and clapboard work were soon used
 synonymously.62

 Chesapeake builders borrowed one more element?the false plate?

 from English carpentry practice to round out their invention. Carpen
 ters working in the box-frame tradition, the one that required
 sophisticated joinery, had to perfectly align the heavy, load-bearing,
 principal rafters with the associated tie-beams (the spanning timbers
 that held the front and back walls together) in order to mortise-and
 tenon the one to the other. Typically, then, the major wall posts

 underpinned these rafter pairs in an orderly transfer of loads from roof
 to foundation. Builders of slight frames, by contrast, employed a va
 riety of clever methods to stand roofs on top of walls without regard to
 the structure underneath, thereby greatly simplifying the assembly pro
 cess yet again. Every building must have cross-beams that span the
 distance between the front and back walls for the purpose of holding
 them together against the outward thrusting pressure exerted by the
 weight of the roof. Builders of slight frames knew that these tie-beams,
 or "joists" as they came to be called in common work, could be ex
 tended a few inches beyond the wall line, front and back, and could
 carry along the upper ends of these extensions a horizontal timber
 called a false plate ("false" because, suspended in midair, it was not
 strictly a wall plate). The false plate, not the walls, became the seat for
 the rafter feet (see Figure 7). Carpenters from the West of England
 packed a false-plate prototype in the bag of tricks they brought to the
 Chesapeake. There they developed it further as a complement to the
 common rafter roof. Throughout the second half of the seventeenth
 century, the plate was a thick board, typically lapped across and se
 cured to the joist ends with wooden pegs. Its upper face was notched
 to receive the feet of the rafters, thereby eliminating any need for
 complicated tenon joinery. The labor-saving false plate became a hall
 mark of Chesapeake framing. It continued in use in various forms until
 the early twentieth century.

 Many factors conspired to perpetuate building, repairing, and re
 building inexpensive and short-lived structures in the Tidewater
 South?the relentless demands of a volatile tobacco market, a high
 male-to-female sex ratio that forestalled normal family formation, a
 disease environment that broke up families prematurely and frustrated
 the orderly transfer of wealth and property from one generation to the
 next, and the influx of immigrants who continually renewed English
 customs and practices, to name a few. Toward the end of the seven
 teenth century, Chesapeake society grew more stable and predictable
 as the trade in African slaves increased, the flow of indentured servants
 declined, and the economy became more diversified. Planters re
 sponded by investing in better-built, longer-lasting structures. Across
 the region the earliest surviving dwellings and farm buildings consis
 tently date from the decades when farmers began growing and mar
 keting grains as well as tobacco.63 By then, though, the incessant repair

 and replacement of impermanent buildings going back two or three
 generations had turned what once had been experiments and novel
 ties into standard building practices everywhere from the upper
 Chesapeake Bay to the Albemarle Sound. No longer was slight framing
 always synonymous with poverty. A party of nonconformist Virginians
 who founded a settlement at Providence on the Severn River in

 Maryland built frontier houses with the homesteader's conventional
 mud walls, but they were not without the means to glaze the windows,
 tile the roofs, cover the floors with green and yellow pavers, and
 decorate the best rooms with fireplace tiles of blue-and-white delftware
 (see Figure 9).64 Eventually even earthfast technologies passed into
 mainstream carpentry culture. Two very wealthy and well-established
 Maryland planters built substantial timber-frame dwellings as late as
 1702 and 1703. Notwithstanding, Cedar Park (see Figure 10) and
 Sotterley originally employed post-in-the-ground construction, with
 both houses surviving 300 years only because later owners retrofitted
 them with brick foundations.65 These examples are merely the most
 extreme holdovers. Everywhere throughout the region the legacy of a
 clapboard-inspired framing system held sway for another 150 years or
 more. Behind the sawn and painted weatherboard siding that dressed
 up the appearance of merchants' houses in prim and proper
 Williamsburg, and underneath the round-butt shingles that roofed
 pretty plantation houses in the countryside, were the descendants of the
 box frame, the slight frame, and the common rafter roof. Generations
 of experimenting carpenters had learned lessons that Chesapeake
 builders never forgot. Building successful towns, our next case study,
 depended less on individual innovators than on lessons learned mutu
 ally by a group of risk takers.

 While archaeologists in modern times have mainly investigated
 plantation sites, they have also made important discoveries at
 Wolstenholme Town in Virginia; St. Mary's City, the seventeenth
 century capital of Maryland; Providence Town on the upper
 Chesapeake Bay; and, recently with much fanfare, the earliest fort site
 at Jamestown, which conventional wisdom had written off as lost to

 Colonial National Historical Park at Jamestown, principally that por
 tion of the island that came to be known as "New Towne" when settlers

 began leaving James Fort in the 1610s. This reanalysis of previous
 work was done in the 1990s by Colonial Williamsburg and the College
 of William and Mary on contract for the National Park Service.67
 Strictly speaking, the project archaeologists undertook no new exca
 vations, limiting themselves to testing earlier features that had been left
 unfinished or poorly recorded by excavators in the 1930s, 1940s, and
 1950s. The reassessment made its most original contribution to schol
 arship in two other ways: first, by reinterpreting the New Towne col
 lections in light of everything that archaeologists and students of
 material culture had learned in the intervening fifty years and, second,
 by creating a tract map as complete as the island's fragmentary land
 records would allow (see Figure 11). The map puts identified owners
 and tenants on plotted properties at known times in the seventeenth
 century. When the tracts are overlaid on the archaeological site plan,

 Jamestown jumps off the page.68 It emerges for the first time as a real
 place inhabited by people who were busy trying to find a winning
 combination of urban activities befitting their idea of a capital city.

 Jamestown's flops are famous.69 Even at the time, its failure to live
 up to boosters' expectations was taken as proof that towns and urban
 culture had no future in a region dominated by a market crop that
 growers raised on remote plantations and traded directly from conve
 nient landings. There is no denying that Jamestown developed by fits
 and starts. All the same, the town's many misadventures can be better
 understood as a series of experiments. Each was a deliberate attempt
 to create an urban settlement that would accomplish something

 ment to a place they renamed Williamsburg. By a process of trial and
 error, residents of Jamestown had finally discovered?alas, too late!?
 an urban formula that promised to work as well there on the island as it
 did later at Williamsburg and other urban places throughout the South.
 Together the archaeological and historical evidence documents three
 Jamestown incarnations. The first two were mistakes, but instructive

 nevertheless, as failed experiments often are. Urban planners learned
 valuable lessons that eventually led to the promising redevelopment of
 the town after 1662.

 The first trial took the form and function of a trading post. The

 expeditionary force that sailed up the James River in 1607 was search
 ing for a defensible site on which to build a trade castle similar to those
 run by the Portuguese in West Africa and Mombasa.70 The earliest
 English entrepreneurs came to North America as middlemen, not set
 tlers; they counted on meeting native peoples willing to supply them
 with gold, furs, and skins from the interior just as Africans supplied the
 Portuguese with gold, slaves, and ivory. The island fastness the English
 built at Jamestown enclosed warehouses, barracks, and workshops for
 the small staff of merchants, soldiers, and artisans who were expected
 to manage the Indian trade and prospect for valuable mineral resources.
 Archaeologists have begun finding these long, multipurpose buildings
 lined up inside the triangular fort and enclosed in a somewhat later
 extension to the palisade (see Figure 5). They have unearthed furnaces,
 crucibles, and imported scrap metal used to assay minerals needed for
 making brass. The excavations have also turned up caches of Indian
 trade goods?"truckinge stuffs"?such as tubular beads, coins, jettons,
 and other prestige goods, including scraps of the red copper that Ralph
 Lane said were especially prized by the Indians.71

 They were prized, yes, but not enough to induce the natives to play

 the part scripted for them. The Powhatan Indians had their own agenda,
 namely, to tolerate the newcomers but subordinate them to their chief -
 doms.72 The directors of the Virginia Company, once informed of their
 miscalculation by Captain John Smith, cast about for alternative
 schemes to repay their investment.73 Those led to the second experi
 ment in urbanizing Jamestown, its redevelopment as a base of opera
 tions for extractive industries and commercial agriculture. Both
 capitalized on the colony's natural resources. Henceforth, Virginia
 would pay back the company's investors by exporting raw materials,
 by processing commodities that required large amounts of fuel, and by
 recruiting settlers and servants (and eventually importing Africans) to
 grow cash crops, notably, high-yield Orinoco tobacco after 1619. Re
 envisioned as the capital of a territorial settlement, Jamestown would
 become a commercial, manufacturing, and transshipment center. A
 larger population of settlers engaged in those activities soon outgrew
 the confines of the fort and spilled into a "New Towne" outside the
 gates.

 Where first? Distribution maps of datable artifacts collected over the
 entire site show that occupation in the late 1610s and 1620s was
 concentrated along the waterfront and on three industrial sites. One lay
 along Back River behind the fort, another at the far eastern end of the
 town lands, and the third at Glasshouse Point across the tidal isthmus

 (see Figure 1). Merchants built warehouses on the riverbank, and ven
 ture capitalists, encouraged by several governors, launched numerous
 speculative "projects," as such ventures were called in England.74 At
 Jamestown they were aimed at setting up glassblowers, potters, pipe
 makers, brewers, distillers, apothecaries, vintners, sawmillers, silk
 worm breeders, fish driers, shipwrights, and mining prospectors
 (searching less for gold than for zinc for brass making)?all eager to
 tap Virginia's natural resources and harness its abundant fuel supplies.
 The tract map reveals further that the government officials who were
 needed to staff the growing colony preferred to live at Jamestown even
 though many built country estates off the island as well.

 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY

 The great London merchants who founded the Virginia Company
 and had followed the planners' original playbook for the first ten years
 had not waxed as rich as they expected. Their failure, especially when
 compared with the success enjoyed by private investors in the Bermuda
 Company, led to the first major overhaul that drew practical lessons
 from real-world experience. Gentlemen, rather than merchants, became
 the colony's prime investors going forward. Being "greived to see this
 great Action fall to nothinge," they offered "to take the matter a new
 in hand and at their pryvate charges (ioyninge themselvs into Societies)

 to sett vpp divers pticularr Plantacons" that would be free of debts and
 unencumbered by restrictions that hobbled the parent company.75
 More than thirty particular plantations registered land grants between
 1617 and 1623. The stay-at-home gentry investors had learned by then
 to stake their hopes on two fairly reliable moneymakers, tobacco and
 rents. The exploitation of other commodities?pitch, tar, clapboards,
 potash, and the like?was useful to defray start-up costs, but the joint
 stock company investors already understood that agriculture, not min
 ing or manufacturing, was the principal way to wealth in Virginia.76
 "Tobacco onely was the business," it was plain to see. "[E]very man
 madded [went crazy] upon that, and [gave] lyttle thought or looked for
 any thinge else."77

 That choice pushed Jamestown to the sidelines. The "chief seat," as
 it came to be known, was left to develop as a conventional company
 town?a headquarters for Virginia Company agents and later Crown
 officials, a garrison for their soldiers, and a so-called factory for resi
 dent merchants who managed the tobacco trade. To funnel commerce
 through the warehouses they built along the riverfront, repeated at
 tempts were made from 1624 until the 1660s to make Jamestown the
 exclusive port of entry to the colony and require freighters to break
 cargo there before proceeding to other landings.78 The ruling was hard

 to enforce; furthermore, it was countermanded more than once by
 officials in London who considered it a hindrance to trade and an

 annoyance to planters. Even so, conventional wisdom persisted among
 many traders who believed that anyone doing business in Virginia
 "must keep a house here [at Jamestown] and continue all the year [in
 order] that he may be prepared, when the tobacco comes from the field,
 to seize it."79 Some did. On one hand, the reconstructed tract map
 confirms Governor John Harvey's claim in 1638 that "[t]here was not

 one foote of ground for half a mile together by the Rivers syde in James
 Towne but was taken up and undertaken to be built" on.80 On the other
 hand, archaeological investigations along the same shore prove that
 many patented lots were never improved, at least not until later. Well
 into the 1640s and 1650s wharves, warehouses, stores, and merchants'

 dwellings?many already neglected?shared waterfront locations with
 workshops, kilns, rubbish tips, and stockpiled oyster shells, lime, and
 charcoal.81 The marketplace?such as it was?was still located inside
 the dilapidated palisade as late as 1627 or later.82 The town's economy
 followed the planters' calendar. The place boomed when the tobacco
 fleet lay at anchor, sometimes thirty ships at once.83 Most other times,
 though, the reputed metropolis fulfilled its reputation as "this unhappy
 Town."84

 That had not been anyone's intention. Several governors prevailed
 on the colony's legislators to pass bills "for laying out ground for
 merchants, handicraftsmen and tradesmen . . . whereby the Towne may
 be peopled."85 For a few years in the 1630s and 1640s the fledgling

 town seemed destined to fulfill that promise. A Back Street opened up
 behind warehouse row. Platted lots became building sites.86 On one the
 colony's secretary, Richard Kemp, built the first brick dwelling in town
 in 1638, "the fairest that ever was knowen in this countrye for sub

 stance and uniformity."87 A few others followed his example.88 The
 growing town provided good livings for skilled artisans whom three
 governors?Sir John Harvey, Sir Francis Wyatt, and Sir William
 Berkeley?had been instructed to settle in newly founded towns.89
 Archaeological excavations confirm that the market for most of the
 trades known to have been practiced at Jamestown was mainly local?
 brick and tile making, lime burning, coarse pottery making, brewing,
 blacksmithing, repairing guns, and casting shot.90

 More ambitious projects aimed at overseas markets?glassmaking,
 for instance, and possibly pharmaceutical production?had little
 chance of success.91 Specialized labor was always scarce, and already
 Virginians had learned that their energies and resources were better
 spent growing tobacco for export and importing whatever manufac
 tured goods they needed. Jamestown's growth and development re
 flected those choices by midcentury. While opportunities for various
 light industries won praise from a foreigner who wintered over at
 Jamestown in 1649, he and others were impressed most of all by the
 tobacco fleet riding at anchor and the seven hundred to eight hundred

 mariners who came ashore annually to carouse at no fewer than six
 "publike Brewhouses."92

 Jamestown's bubble?such as it was?burst the very next year.
 Parliament beheaded Charles I, passed the Navigation Act in 1651, and
 went to war with Holland the year after that. The prohibition against all
 non-British shipping and England's preoccupation with affairs at home
 during the decade of Commonwealth rule brought Jamestown to its
 knees. Three of the six brewhouses went bankrupt immediately.93
 Warehouses handled fewer and fewer goods. And all attempts at in
 dustry withered to extinction if the silence of written records and the
 absence of archaeological evidence bear witness to their failure. The
 second coming of Jamestown had run its course in less than twenty
 five years.

 The trading post experiment had failed for want of gold and silver
 and too little cooperation from native inhabitants "unaccustom'd to
 barter."94 Opposition from planters in Virginia, merchants in London,
 and officials at Whitehall eventually defeated the attempt to reinvent
 Jamestown as a trade center and a workshop to the empire. The third
 experiment came to terms with these powerful interest groups and, in
 so doing, arrived at an urban formula that would be successfully rep
 licated throughout the Chesapeake region for the next 150 years.

 The restoration of royal government did not herald a new policy

 toward Virginia so much as it renewed Britain's attention to the colo
 ny's economy. Governor Berkeley resumed his post in 1660, and the
 next year the burgesses dispatched him to London to lobby for free
 trade, curbs on runaway tobacco production, incentives to encourage
 agricultural and industrial diversification, and a royal mandate to re
 vitalize Jamestown and found other urban centers throughout the re
 gion. They were not new ideas, but now, Berkeley discovered, the
 context had changed dramatically. The measures he advocated folded
 into a much larger conversation about managing Britain's overseas
 colonies to finance a growing empire, rebuild the navy, and wage

 foreign wars. Industrious towns were key, at least in Virginia. Or so
 argued Berkeley's most powerful allies in London. Pragmatism was
 their watchword: if the government settled skilled artisans in a few port
 towns located on the principal rivers in the region and restricted trade
 to those places, commerce would expand, tobacco would loosen its
 stranglehold on the economy, a multiplicity of exports would increase
 revenues, and the need to ban foreign shippers would simply go
 away.

 96

 In the end, the Council for Foreign Plantations neither repealed the
 Navigation Acts nor restored Jamestown's exclusive trading privileges,
 Berkeley's two fallback positions. But the king did not send the gov
 ernor home empty-handed. His orders authorized two measures that
 Berkeley could pursue on his own initiative.97 One?rejuvenating
 Jamestown?was a priority for the Crown; the other was Berkeley's?
 supplementing tobacco cultivation with the production of flax, hemp,
 silk, potash, pitch and tar, and pig iron. Berkeley envisioned a day
 when colony and capital together might become "the Fortresse; Mart
 and Magazin of all the West Indies."9* It was the old dream, now
 revived and writ large.

 And for a while a thorough makeover seemed achievable. Within
 weeks of the governor's return, the burgesses passed "An act for build
 ing a towne," the capital city first but afterward additional settlements
 on the principal rivers that flowed into the bay. The act mandated that
 no new wooden houses be erected within the city limits of Jamestown.
 Further, it called for thirty-two new, two-story, brick houses, all with
 fireproof roofs of tile or slate. A special head tax was levied to pay for
 seventeen government-built units, and the legislation authorized each
 county court to impress the artisans and building materials it needed.
 Berkeley's instructions from the king anticipated that councillors and
 other big men in the colony would set "good Examples" by building
 the remaining fifteen houses with private funds. The bill gave the

 governor broad powers as chief city planner to select a site, hire a
 surveyor, and direct that all new buildings be "regularly placed one by
 another in a square or such other forme" as he thought best. It was a
 typical government crash program. Even the due date was prescribed
 by law?March 1665, two years from start to finish.99

 Berkeley threw himself into the task with great energy at first, and
 indeed his self-styled "brave Towne" made a brave start.100 As the
 deadline drew near, and despite inevitable slippage, the colony's sec
 retary could report to Whitehall that "we have begun a town of brick
 and have allreddy built enough to accommodate both the publique
 affairs of ye country and to begin a factory for merchants."101 True it
 was. Excavations in New Towne since the 1930s have discovered

 numerous brick structures, public and private, that the recent reassess
 ment verifies were constructed in response to the town building act of
 1662. Most unexpected were three rows of party-wall houses, as up
 to-the-minute as any speculative terrace housing to be found in the
 sprawling suburbs of London (see Figure 12). The smallest of them
 incorporated two units, soon expanded to three; the two largest com
 prised four units each, one of them later doubled to eight. All con
 formed to dimensions set out in the legislation: two ground-floor
 rooms, in essence a hall and a parlor, dividing a 20 by 40 foot floor
 plan, shared chimney stacks in each house, brick walls two stories
 high, and a roof covered with pantiles or slates. A purpose-built state
 house was to be attached to the largest row, extending its length to 158
 feet. An abandoned cellar hole facing the backside of the three-house

 row was probably intended for its twin. It is the most suggestive evidence
 of a civic square produced so far, although many parts of New Towne
 remain unexcavated and unexplored. An extensive brickyard on the out
 skirts of town produced hundreds of thousands of bricks and tiles as the
 work got underway in the spring of 1663 (see Figure l).102

 fire-resistant building materials?represented conventional top-down
 planning by fiat from London, rubber-stamped by the General
 Assembly in Virginia. The stipulated formalities of the new program
 combined at Jamestown the image and expectations of the metropolis
 with local boosters' own English-born cultural ambitions. To appreci
 ate the strictly homegrown element in this legislated town?the im
 provised part?we must learn from archaeology what functions the
 new buildings served and from the tract map who owned and occupied
 them or leased them to tenants.

 Jamestown had, of course, long been a seasonal meeting place for
 the courts, council, and assembly. Always previously they had con
 vened in taverns and rented rooms, much to the disgrace of the justices
 and lawmakers. Berkeley and the burgesses set out to create a dignified
 capital. The centerpiece was a custom-made statehouse, completed by
 1665 (see Figure 12).103 In addition, the seventeen brick dwellings
 erected at public expense were supposed to provide comfortable lodg
 ings for burgesses and officials, while the fifteen privately financed
 townhouses were owned or leased by wealthy councillors, judges, and
 merchants. Thus would the orderly, newly made capital accommodate
 both the civic and the commercial needs of the colony. That was the
 plan, but, even as the first buildings began to take shape in the spring
 following passage of the bill, Berkeley watched the work proceed in a
 manner that he had not foreseen. Most of the councillors?the "rich

 men," he called them?hung back. They "expend no more," he com
 plained, "than what is usefull to them in order to [hasten] their return
 for England." The merchants were even stingier, offering Berkeley
 mere "Alms," which he spurned. The strongest supporters of his re
 building program were, he said, "the poorer sort [who] see that want
 and misery will sooner Come upon them for want of a Town then on
 the rich men; and that makes them more willing to Contribute for their

 further good."104 Yet even that was not the whole truth. The head tax
 was widely resented by ordinary planters in the countryside, who bit
 terly complained that rebuilding Jamestown held nothing for them.105

 So who did gain? Who were "the poorer sort" who invested their
 own money in the new rows of terrace houses and the upscale taverns?
 Whose involvement in the redevelopment of Jamestown transformed a
 monarch's instructions and a governor's dreams into the first durable
 urban experiment in Virginia? The archaeological reassessment team
 found that the developers were generally locals; many were longtime
 residents of the colony; and not a few owned property, married wives,
 or sued neighbors in Surry County across the river. When their back
 grounds can be checked at all, they appear to have dabbled in real
 estate on the island and elsewhere for many years prior to 1662. The
 Jamestown project came as a bolt out of the blue. The town act opened
 a honeypot that small-time entrepreneurs could not resist.106

 Thomas Woodhouse was one. Although he resided in Surry County
 for a number of years, he speculated in properties as far away as the
 Potomac River. He moved to Jamestown by 1655 to play the rental
 market by buying one of three units in a row of houses that Berkeley
 had built ten years earlier. Woodhouse promptly leased it as meeting
 rooms for the Governor's Council, the Quarter Sessions Court, and the

 General Assembly.107 Under the counter he may also have operated a
 tavern, for this was the time when the burgesses bemoaned "the dis
 honour of our Lawes being made and Judgments given in
 Ale-houses."108 Woodhouse picked up other parcels on the island.
 Some he turned over quickly, for example a prime lot along the shore
 that he probably unloaded too quickly in February 1662, for the two
 developers (also with Surry County connections) who owned the prop
 erty ten months later when the assembly passed the town bill seized
 that golden opportunity to build an impressive rowhouse facing the
 harbor, Structure 17. No matter. Woodhouse put his money into an
 other terrace project going up on Back Street, two houses in the
 Structure 115 row that shared a party wall with a pair of so-called
 country houses built at public expense.

 Careful study of speculators like Thomas Woodhouse and their
 activities immediately following Berkeley's return from London
 identifies these months as the turning point in Jamestown's develop

 ment as an urban place and the real starting point for the town-building
 model that afterward spread throughout the region. "The act for build

 ing a towne," unexpected as it was, produced an overnight windfall for
 a number of canny local capitalists who did not hesitate to jump in with
 both feet. Not all were small-time operators. Two Berkeley confidants,

 Francis Moryson and Thomas Ludwell, stood apart from the otherwise
 "universall backwardness of the Councill." Both lent "their Councills,

 Encouragements, and Purses" to the effort.109 As did Colonel Thomas
 Swann?another councillor, Surryman, and publican. He clearly saw
 opportunity beckoning and accordingly built a fine brick tavern posi
 tioned on the high street halfway between the statehouse and the law
 makers' smart new lodgings.

 Swann's entrepreneurship illustrates the larger point: A few coun
 cillors and many more petty capitalists saw the rebuilding of
 Jamestown as a personal investment opportunity, not the first step in
 creating the seat of a mighty West Indian empire. The Ludwells and
 Swanns no less than the Woodhouses bought and sold real estate with
 no loftier aim than an ambition to rent lodgings during court season,
 lease office space, hire out meeting rooms, collect compensation for
 boarding the colony's official guests (frequently including delegations
 of Indians), and always and everywhere supply their patrons with food
 and drink. Their endeavors built no fewer than twelve brick houses in

 the town by the mid-1670s and, despite the prohibition, a number of
 frame dwellings as well. Some observers put the total nearer twenty.110
 That part was according to plan, more or less. The use these structures
 were put to was not, for as Robert Beverley ruefully observed many
 years later, "most of the Buildings were soon converted into Houses
 of Entertainment."111 That was the homegrown dimension to
 Jamestown's redevelopment, that and the general failure to rebuild the
 town's commercial center. Rickety wharves were not repaired, old
 warehouses not replaced, and, behind it all, the town's trading mo
 nopoly not restored. Planters agitated against the "Inconvenient and

 prejudiciall" requirement that their tobacco be collected at Jamestown
 for shipment overseas.112 Rather than accept this key element in
 Berkeley's renovation plan, they argued that their interests were better
 served "by every man keepinge his owne comodity and deliveringe it
 from his [own] howse." "By this Means," the top-down planners
 fumed, "the Design of Towns was totally baulk'd."113

 Idealized towns, yes, but, short-lived as Jamestown's boom time
 proved to be, the rudiments of an indigenous approach to urban de
 velopment put down hardy roots that flourished even after Berkeley's
 interest in the town's renewal flagged in the 1670s.114 They withstood
 a greater test in 1676 when the rebel Nathaniel Bacon stormed the town

 and burned many public buildings and private residences to the ground,
 including the almost-new statehouse. The calamity was a huge setback
 to official Jamestown. Six years later the British government's Colo
 nial Office was still issuing instructions to rebuild the town "as soon as
 possible." Regardless, the General Assembly took almost ten years to
 replace its meetinghouse. Playing politics, the "Gentlemen of the
 Country" deftly blunted the Crown's efforts to levy new taxes to re
 build the seat of empire.115 In contrast, the ashes were barely cold
 before local profiteers swarmed in to fill the void. Some bought and
 renovated damaged properties; others built new ones from the ground
 up, sometimes more splendidly than the capital had seen previously;
 and all raced to provide interim accommodations for the officials and
 branches of government desperate for office space and meeting
 rooms.116

 This second rebuilding of Jamestown brought forward a younger
 generation of developers, men like William Sherwood. An attorney,
 merchant, slave trader, and speculator, Sherwood had settled in
 Virginia (first in Surry County) just as the last urban renewal program
 was winding down. A young man in his twenties, he married a
 Jamestown property owner, acquired half-interests in other parcels
 through partnerships, and bought still other tracts outright.117 Two of

 turned a burned-out shell of a house next door into a blue-chip rental

 property.119

 This last building, a rebuilt, refaced, one- or two-story, brick struc
 ture, deserves a closer look. It, more than several haphazardly repaired
 rowhouses or even the new statehouse, exemplifies the manner in
 which Jamestown became a successful urban place in the final decades
 of the century and a true precursor to Williamsburg and many eigh
 teenth-century courthouse towns across Virginia. Bacon's Rebellion
 had come as a wake-up call to the Lords of Trade and Plantations, the
 Crown's group of ministers giving advice on colonial issues. In its
 aftermath, they resolved to bring Virginia under much tighter control.
 Berkeley was replaced by a series of governors-general who were
 issued orders to force the wayward colony back into Britain's imperial
 fold. None was more resolute than Francis Howard, fifth baron Howard

 of Effingham.120 He took up the post in 1684 fully cognizant that,
 despite his sovereign's oft-repeated opinion that Jamestown was the
 "most convenient place for the Metropolis of Our said Colony," there
 had not "till now of late been Any Great Advance therein."121
 Effingham meant to change that. William Sherwood was happy to
 oblige. Even after the half-finished statehouse opened for occupancy in
 December 1685, the governor asked the burgesses to lease from
 Sherwood "his Hall, small back room, and Cellar, for ye use of his
 Majesties Governor and Councel." His reason was partly convenience,
 "his Excellency having lodgings in ye same house," and owed partly to
 a spat with the assembly over office space in the new building.122 He
 may also have been pulling rank. According to Robert Beverley, a

 fierce critic of the viceroy's attempt to use the council as a powerful,
 chancery-like court of equity, the governor had "erected himself into a
 Lord Chancellor" and set out to find a suitable meeting place for that
 use, "a private House" that "might have more the Air of a new Court."
 His Excellency would not deign, Beverley sneered, to "so much as sit
 in the State-House, where all the other publick Business was
 dispatch'd."123 Sherwood, however, consummate government contrac
 tor that he was, fully understood the premium Effingham attached to
 his "privacy and dignity."124 Sherwood was eager to offer his humble
 service. As it so happened he had recently remodeled a property that
 would, he begged leave to suggest, answer his lordship's every expec
 tation. Until National Park Service archaeologists excavated the site of
 Structure 138/53, the best description of Effingham's elegant meeting
 rooms was Beverley's report that the governor "took the Dining
 Room" in a house that also contained a "great Hall" and other rooms
 besides.125 Rental property though it was, its amenities included a
 specifically designated dining room, marking it as an exceptionally
 fashionable accommodation for the 1680s. How exceptional was only
 revealed when archaeologists unearthed thousands of fragments of
 ornamental plasterwork. Some had formed a chimneypiece sculpted
 with three-dimensional, half-size animals and human figures flanking
 an official coat of arms; others came from one or more ceilings framed

 round with heavy classical cornices and richly decorated with rosettes,
 volutes, and acanthus leaf sprays in a high-style Baroque composition
 not even seen in English interiors before the 1670s. In other words,
 Sherwood had somehow found the men and the means to rehabilitate

 a fire-sale wreck into a high-end executive boardroom for the coun
 cillors sitting in chancery and a posh pied-?-terre for the governor
 when affairs of state or ill health kept him in town overnight.

 The juxtaposition of sophisticated accommodations alongside others
 described as "rotten & decayed" is a clue to understanding the dynam
 ics that finally led to a successful formula for urban development in the
 tobacco South. It makes perfect sense of Governor Thomas Culpeper's
 offhand observation that, while building townhouses had "been once
 attempted in vaine," in the real world of seventeenth-century Virginia,
 "nothing but profitt and advantage can doe it, and then there will be

 noe need of Anything else." The rebirth of Jamestown after 1662
 did not revive the busy port that it was promising to become by the end
 of the 1640s, nor did it rekindle any serious attempt to make the town

 a production center. The purely local response to Berkeley's town act
 and then to the devastation that Bacon's army left behind produced a
 peculiar on-and-off sort of place by the 1670s and 1680s. Half the year
 the capital appeared abandoned and neglected. One eyewitness counted
 approximately eighteen brick houses, all "faire and large; and in them
 about a dozen Families (for all the howses are not inhabited)," but,
 when they were, they got their "liveings by keepeing of ordnaries, at
 exstreordnary rates." Exactly. During court season Jamestown filled up
 to overflowing. The uninhabited houses came to life as rented lodg
 ings; year-round residents sublet back rooms and upstairs chambers;
 clerks and secretaries squeezed into makeshift office space; courts and
 committees doubled up in great rooms and dining chambers; and store
 keepers and alehouse operators made up in a few short weeks what
 they did not sell during the off-season doldrums.127 Not only did
 complaints about "the excessive rates set by ordinary keepers about
 James City at Assembly times" go unheeded, but the burgesses also
 took care to exempt Jamestown's tavern-keepers from restrictive leg
 islation that might discourage business. Furthermore, the lawmakers
 allowed publicans to extend credit to anyone visiting the capital while
 the assembly or General Court was in session.128

 In their own un-English way, "publick times" in the Virginia capital
 came to resemble the social seasons that had begun to attract country
 gentlemen to pleasure towns in provincial Britain.129 Only in its ex
 ecution and use was this newfangled urban ideal transformed by reality
 in North America. The combination of public buildings, boarding
 houses, taverns, and retail stores first came together successfully on
 Jamestown Island. Eventually it became the standard mix of facilities

 and activities found at every courthouse crossroads in the colony. All
 too soon, upstart Williamsburg absconded with Jamestown's capitol,
 commerce, and even its culture. The justification given was the old
 town's manifest failures. In truth, archaeologists now tell us, the
 Jamestown formula was worth kidnapping to Williamsburg because it
 finally had proved to be a prescription that worked.

 The farmers, carpenters, and townspeople who migrated to the
 southern American colonies came from different regions in the British
 Isles and from different backgrounds. Why, then, does their New

 World experience appear so uniform in the three case studies we have
 just considered? Granted, here and there a few affluent individuals
 stand out from the rest?for instance, Sir Thomas Cornwaleys, who
 skipped the efficiencies of homesteading and built an expensive
 English framed house right away, or, to take an example from
 Jamestown, the "rich men" among William Berkeley's councillors who
 chose not to hazard their fortunes on urban renewal. These individuals

 were exceptions. Different, too, must have been the lives of unfree
 settlers in the region, servants and slaves who had no say in the choices
 that freeholders made. Other than these, though, and try as we might,
 we have found in the archaeological evidence few deviations from the
 more or less common experience described in these case studies, de
 partures that we might have attributed to known differences in people's
 social standing, wealth, or place of origin. Immigration and coloniza
 tion leveled the playing field for almost everybody.

 Some of the reasons are obvious and predictable. Emigrants from

 England necessarily left behind fixed assets that had given advantages
 to some that were denied to others, assets such as inherited farms and

 agricultural improvements, well-established herds and flocks, and ac
 cess to affordable labor. In the colonies every newcomer was a fresh

 man. Almost always that meant that settlers focused first on setting
 themselves up to earn a living as quickly and cheaply as possible. They
 grasped at shortcuts, went for the easy money, and made plans for the
 here and now rather than for some faraway future. No matter who they
 were, their choices were tempered by conditions that applied to all?
 expensive labor, cheap land, plentiful natural resources, scattered
 settlements along navigable waterways, and for many years a killer
 disease environment. No wonder the planters, craftsmen, and urban
 boosters who feature in the foregoing studies all seem to have behaved
 in much the same way.

 That much is fairly unremarkable. But we can learn a little more

 from the archaeological evidence assembled in these studies. Not only
 have excavators explored enough sites in the region to chart long-term
 changes in husbandry practices, building traditions, and the develop
 ment of Jamestown over the entire seventeenth century, but they also
 have documented false starts, dead ends, and experiments that went
 nowhere. Archaeological evidence lets us see people's trials and errors
 up close. At that range we become aware of a learning process that
 almost all new arrivals to Virginia and Maryland underwent, as did
 newcomers to any colony. Abandoned experiments are a fossil record
 of older customs and practices that colonists tested against the unfa
 miliar circumstances they encountered in their new homes or against
 the no less unfamiliar solutions that earlier colonists had devised in

 their own attempts to cope with life's new imperatives.

 Archaeologists sometimes find it is useful to think about culture as
 a continually evolving system of transmitting knowledge from one
 generation or one individual to another. Cultural change occurs slowly
 where the future seems more or less predictable and when know-how
 that passes from parents to children or from masters to apprentices
 appears to be as serviceable to the young as it has been to the old. But

 when people find themselves in stressful situations where their cultural
 inheritance does them no good, learning takes place quickly and fol
 lows two very different paths. At first, people try anything, hit or miss.
 Certain eccentric carpentry practices detected by Chesapeake archae
 ologists may represent just such stabs in the dark. Soon, though, ex
 perimenters hit upon alternatives that strike a promising balance
 between the costs and the perceived benefits. These apparent solutions
 quickly turn into a form of social learning as imitators copy the inno
 vators?the second learning strategy.130 As we saw in the first study,
 early Chesapeake farmers, unaccustomed to slash-and-burn agricul
 ture, nevertheless soon discovered the wisdom of adopting Indian
 farming methods as a way to put crops in the ground immediately. The
 radically different environment of Virginia and Maryland did not in
 validate all inherited knowledge by any means. Generations of English
 farmers had learned from their elders about the herding instincts of
 cows and pigs, just as generations of carpenters had passed along
 building techniques that became useful starting points for experiments
 with earthfast technologies in the colonies.

 Objects are a physical record of people's choices. Whether bones,
 tools, buildings, or entire towns, these three-dimensional things left

 evidence that measures how well they performed their intended tasks
 in the Chesapeake colonies. The successful ones persisted?for ex
 ample, the seasonal seat of government that Jamestown became after
 1662. Unsuccessful artifacts, having no lasting consequences, fizzled
 out as surely as had Jamestown the trading post or Jamestown the
 transshipment center. Thus, by tracking the evolution of artifacts in
 much the same way that geneticists trace the lineage of genes, archae
 ologists can show how the process of inheritance through social learn
 ing worked as the mechanism that created new cultural traditions.
 Social learning?essentially learning from successful neighbors?had
 the practical effect of narrowing the selection of alternatives.131 Little
 by little, repeated practice produced new vocabularies ("the Virginia
 house"), a new knowledge of materials (oak and chestnut clapboards),
 new skills (splitting and riving), new recipes ("clapboard work"), new
 trades ("the art and science of [the] clap board carpenter"), and even
 tually entirely new traditions.132 At first, innovations moved very
 quickly and directly to workmates, new arrivals, and neighbors but
 then went mainly sideways from one individual to another. Later, as
 new practices proved their worth, inheritance gradually became gen
 erational, as it had been back home. Parents began teaching accepted
 innovations to children as objective truth; masters presented them to
 journeymen as the ancient mysteries of their trade; and in due course
 they simply became the new subjective reality for everyone.

 This description of the social learning path by which Old World
 cultures assumed new dimensions in overseas colonies sounds more

 streamlined in the telling than it ever was in fact. Colonizers always
 included a fair share of "old sticks," people wedded to inherited tra
 ditions no matter what. Furthermore, the continuing flow of immi
 grants to the southern colonies repeatedly reintroduced older customs
 and practices even after people longer settled in the region had altered
 or discarded them. Now and then, archaeologists discover traces of
 these throwbacks, particularly in house plans where domestic habits
 were deeply ingrained. All the same, they remain outliers. They remind
 us that cultural change was a complex, messy, back-and-forth process.
 Yet, because they occur as ever-rarer exceptions to an ever-larger body
 of normative evidence that archaeologists continue to assemble, the
 anomalies testify even more strongly to the steady formation of a new

 dominant cultural inheritance as the seventeenth century drew to a
 close. One thing is certain. Understanding the dynamics of learned
 culture overturns any notion that the earliest English settlers implanted
 their own particular regional lifeways on virgin ground, as it were, and

 that their "seed," being first to germinate, left little or no room for later
 transplants to take root. Not only does that view not square with the
 preponderance of archaeological evidence, but it also fails to take
 account of the fact that the FFV?the legendary First Families of
 Virginia, like first-generation newcomers anywhere?experienced the
 full force of prevailing conditions in their strange new world. They
 responded with the same inventiveness that is the natural reaction of
 any people who find they must accept change or fail.

 That experience, common to colonists everywhere, is one answer to
 historians who ask, how can we "make sense of America" if every
 region developed differently? On one hand, while recent scholarship
 has deepened our appreciation for the tangled circumstances that pro
 duced a gaudy patchwork of sectional cultures throughout the colonies,
 it reduces our ability to explain or even to believe in the possibility of
 a coherent nation.133 On the other hand, all peoples, without exception,
 share the two-way experience of receiving and transmitting ideas, cus
 toms, and practices to and from others in their group. Cultural inher
 itance through social learning in settled societies follows rules that tend
 to reinforce tradition. Uprooted peoples experience something very dif
 ferent. Is it too much to suppose that a nation of migrants?colonists,
 servants, and slaves in the beginning and, after them, newcomers to
 many expanding frontiers, including America's rapidly growing cities

 in the eighteenth century?all shared four things in common at the very
 least? Shattered expectations came first. Then coping. Then mimicking
 the success of people with whom the imitators often had nothing else
 in common except present necessity. And finally, by making a virtue
 of those necessities, creating a heritage better suited to their newly
 adopted home.

 As we began by saying, culture is indivisible from place. To which
 we now can add that circumstances born of place give cultural change
 a hefty push.
