 FROM ORGANIZATION TO SOCIETY: VIRGINIA IN

 THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

 SIGMUND DIAMOND

 ABSTRACT

 Virginia in the early seventeenth century may be taken as an example of a social system established in
 accordance with the model of a commercial organization, in which the behavior of the members was ex-
 pected to be entirely determined by their positions within the organization. The concessions that were of-
 fered to induce them to accept positions within the organization so multiplied the number of statuses they
 held as to alter decisively their behavior and to transform Virginia from a formal organization into a so-
 ciety. The analysis of the early history of Virginia is an illustration of the way in which historical knowl-
 edge may be used to suggest problems of interest to sociological theory.

 Fad and fashion play their roles in the

 spite the fact that the Company had sent

 more than 5,000 emigrants during that

 seventeen-year period.' But, just as a lim-

 ited duration of time is no necessary detri-

 ment to a study of this kind, because there

 are periods of history wlhen the rate of

 change is accelerated, so, too, the limited

 size of the group affords no accurate meas-

 ure of the importance of the enterprise.

 Judged in terms of its outcome, its impor-

 tance is self-evident. But, judged even in

 terms of the criteria of importance imposed

 by contemporaries, the verdict must be the

 same. The articles on the Virginia settle-

 mony of the position of Virginia in the in-

 ternational relations of the seventeenth cen-

 tury and of the concern felt in the capitals

 of Europe in the Virginia Company's un-
 dertaking. Nor was the expression of this

 concern merely verbal. In August, 1613,

 when the population of Virgina barely ex-

 ceeded 200, the settlement at Jamestown
 had a decidedly cosmopolitan cast, for
 it contained eighteen prisoners-fifteen

 Frenchmen, including two Jesuits and sev-

 eral members of the nobility; a Spanish
 spy, Don Diego de Molina; a renegade
 Englishman in the pay of Spain; and an
 Indian princess, Pocahontas.3

 reports from the Venetian ambassadors in

 London to the Doge and Senate; the letters

 archives; the continuing stream of dis-

 patches from the Spanish ambassadors to
 King Philip III, pressing him to attack

 Jamestown, advising him of the latest deci-
 sions of the Virginia Company, and relat-
 ing their efforts to recruit English spies;

 and the existence in the royal archives at
 Simancas of a description of the layout of
 Jamestown and the earliest known map of
 the town, the work of an Irish spy in the
 service of Spain2-all this is eloquent testi-

 student orators-who must have been a

 sophomore-exclaimed:

 Methinks we see already that happy time
 when we shall surpass the Asiaticians in civil-
 ity, the Jews in religion, the Greeks in philoso-
 phy, the Egyptians in geometry, the Phoenicians
 in arithmetic, and the Chaldeans in astrology.
 O happy Virginia.4

 We may be intrigued by the ingenuous-
 ness of the student, but we are interested in
 the statement as evidence of the fact that
 in 1699-and for some time earlier-Vir-

 ginia was a society and Virginians were
 nothing if not ebullient about its prospects.

 For it had not always been so.

 At its inception-and for a number of

 years thereafter-it had been a formal or-
 ganization, and, if the joyous outburst of
 the student reflects its character at a later
 date, its earlier character is better revealed
 by the instructions given by the Virginia
 Company to Sir Thomas Gates on the eve
 of his departure for Jamestown in May,

 1609:

 erned by the British crown; it was not a
 state, and, properly speaking, it was not
 a political unit at all. It was property, the
 property of the Virginia Company of Lon-
 don, and it was established to return a
 profit to the stockholders of that company.
 Under the political and economic condi-
 tions of seventeenth-century England, spec-
 ulators in overseas expansion could count
 on no support from the government except
 verbal encouragement and some legal pro-
 tection-and sometimes precious little of
 these. Under the circumstances, therefore,
 colonization had to be undertaken as a pri-
 vate business venture, and the first charge
 imposed on the property was the return on
 the shareholder's investment. Traditionally,
 this episode has been dealt with primarily
 in terms of the motivation of participants
 -did they come to establish religious free-
 dom, to seek a haven for the politically per-
 secuted, or to found a "First Republic"?-
 and it is true that those who joined the Vir-
 ginia enterprise did so for many reasons.
 Some, like Richard Norwood, were foot-
 loose and fancy-free after having completed
 their apprenticeships. Robert Evelin wrote
 his mother that he was "going to the sea,
 a long and dangerous voyage with other
 men, to make me to be able to pay my
 debts, and to restore my decayed estate
 again . . . and I beseech you, if I do die,
 that you would be good unto my poor wife
 and children, which God knows, I shall
 leave very poor and very mean, if my
 friends be not good unto them." In its pro-
 motional literature the Virginia Company
 took advantage of this broad spectrum of
 motives and cast its net wide to snare the
 purses and bodies of all sorts and condi-
 tions of persons in support of a venture in
 which

 And, if in later years "O happy Virginia"
 could be a spontaneous outcry of its citi-
 zens, it could not have been earlier. Testi-
 fying in 1625 about conditions under the
 administration of Sir Thomas Dale in
 1614-16, Mrs. Perry, one of the fortunates

 who survived more than a few years in the
 first quarter-century of Virginia's history,

 revealed that

 Our first inquiry, then, must be into the

 characteristics of the original settlement at
 Jamestown-characteristics which changed
 so markedly during the course of the next
 quarter-century.

 It must be understood, therefore, that,

 izational form, the establishment planted

 ground with that providence that it afforded

 by the Virginia Company at Jamestown

 victuall at all times; and time had brought them
 to that perfection they had the use of gold and
 silver, and the most of such commodities as
 their countries affoorded; so that what the
 Spaniard got was only the spoile and pillage of
 those countries people, and not the labours of
 their owne hands. But had those fruitfull Coun-
 tries been as Salvage, as barbarous, as ill-peo-
 pled, as little planted laboured and manured, as
 Virginia; their proper labours, it is likely would
 have produced as small profit as ours....

 But we chanced in a land, even as God made
 it.... Which ere wee could bring to recompence
 our paines, defray our charges, and satisfie our
 adventurers; wee were to discover the country,
 subdue the people, bring them to be tractable
 civil and industrious, and teach them trades
 that the fruits of their labours might make us
 recompence, or plant such colonies of our owne
 that must first make provision how to live of
 themselves ere they can bring to perfection the
 commodities of the countrie.1"

 But though the error in conception made
 by the leaders of the Virginia Company
 was, from their viewpoint, a grievous one,

 it is also thoroughly understandable. It is

 true that the late sixteenth and early sev-

 enteenth century was a period of rapid ex-
 pansion in the organization of trading com-

 panies; no less than thirty-four were char-
 tered during that time. But the significant

 point is that the Virginia Company was the
 eighteenth to be founded, and, of the pre-
 vious seventeen, whose experience could be
 taken as models, all dealt with countries
 within the European seas, with settled

 communities along the African coast, or
 with the advanced societies of Asia. For

 them, the problem was to exploit the al-

 ready existing labor force of a settled so-
 ciety.12 For the Virginia Company, the
 problem-and it is in this that the crucial

 Basic policies were laid down in London

 by the General Court of the Company, the

 body of those who had purchased the

 for favors in the Company's behalf; the

 management and direction of affairs were

 intrusted to agents of the shareholders;

 and the supervision of those whose labor

 Company's estimate of the cost of trans-

 among the investors in proportion to the
 number of shares they held, and grants of
 land would be made to them on the same

 basis. But what were to be the inducements
 to become the labor force of a company

 It should be noted at once that the Eng-

 lish imitated the Spaniards in attempting
 to mobilize native labor. For the Company

 heavy work of axing timber, they cursed so

 much at their blisters that the president of

 the council ordered that at the end of the

 day's work a can of cold water be poured

 down the sleeve of each offender for every

 curse he had uttered. To Captain John

 Smith, the problem was the presence of

 too many gentlemen: "For some small
 number of adventrous Gentlemen . . . noth-

 ing were more requisite; but to have more

 to wait and play than worke, or more com-

 manders and officers than industrious la-

 bourers was not so necessarie. For in Vir-

 ginia, a plaine Souldier that can use a Pick-

 axe and spade, is better than five
 Knights."'6

 Clearly, even if the mortality figures had

 been less gruesome than they were-in

 July, 1609, between 80 and 100 were alive

 of the 320 who had been sent since 160717

 As early as 1609, a letter from Lisbon

 revealed that the Portuguese were trans-

 porting fifteen hundred children over the

 age of ten to the East Indies and suggested

 that the same be done in the case of Vir-

 ginia. Shortly thereafter the Privy Council

 notifified the mayor of London that the

 plagues of the city were due mainly to the

 presence of so many poor persons and rec-

 ommended that a fund be raised, with the

 help of the commercial companies, to send

 as many of these as possible to Virginia.

 The Virginia Company promptly gave an

 estimate of the expenses involved and of

 the terms that would be offered to the emi-

 grants; but, though a large sum of money

 was raised, no persons were actually trans-

 ported at that time. In 1617, however, the

 City of London raised ?500 to pay the cost

 of shipping one hundred children to Vir-

 ginia, where they were to be apprenticed

 until the age of twenty-one, thereafter to

 be the fee-simple owners of fifty acres of

 land each. So delighted were the Company

 and the Virginia planters that they contin-

 ued the practice, but it is evident that not

 But throughout its history the Company

 voluntary labor, and especially was this

 true when it realized that profits would

 have to be made from agricultural staples

 and not minerals. The change in objective

 of such persons, and, in any case, convict-

 characteristic of the colonial scene until the
 second half of the seventeenth century.19
 So, too, was the Company antagonistic to
 the importation of rogues, possibly because,
 unlike the case of the London children, it
 was forced to assume the cost of transpor-
 tation. It engaged in the practice under
 pressure from King James I. For one group
 of fifty boys sent out in 1619, the Company
 expected to receive ?500 in tobacco from
 the planters to whom they were inden-
 tured; but as late as October, 1622, it had
 received only ?275.15.6, and Governor
 Yeardley was told that the planters "should

 persons to come to Virginia, especially

 when-as the evidence indicates-enthusi-

 hardly likely to exchange the comforts of

 life in England for the dangers of life in
 Virginia?22 The difficulties the Company
 faced in this respect were exacerbated by
 the whispering campaign started by set-

 It was conceded that some "base and dis-

 ordered men" might inveigle themselves

 into the body of settlers, but they could

 not do too much harm, for, as the Reverend

 William Crashaw said on the departure of
 Governor de la Warr to Virginia, "the

 shares according to the value of his person.

 The Company expected, in return for as-

 suming all the costs of maintaining the

 plantation and providing supplies to the

 emigrants, that each settler would work at

 tasks assigned him under the direction of

 Company-appointed officers. For a period

 of seven years, all supplies were to be dis-

 tributed through the Company store, all

 exports were to be shipped through the

 Company magazine, and all land was to be
 held by the Company.26 In effect, the Com-

 renew our Letters Pattents, and to procure

 to ourselves, such ample and large privi-
 ledges and powers by which we were at lib-

 quite clear; sufficient numbers of workmen
 would be induced to emigrate to Virginia
 and, having arrived, would be motivated to
 do the work that was essential to the Com-
 pany's success. Virginia planter and Lon-
 don adventurer were to be united in a sin-
 gle relationship. Do not discourage the
 planters, the London stockholders were ad-
 monished, "in growing religious, nor in
 gathering riches, two especiall bonds
 (whether severed or cojoined) to keepe
 them in obedience, the one for conscience
 sake, the other for fear of losing what they
 have gotten." How the planter's concern
 for his own interests was to benefit the
 Company was quite clear. "The Planters,"
 wrote Alderman Johnson, "will be in such
 hope to have their owne shares and habita-
 tions in those lands, which they have so
 husbanded, that it will cause contending
 and emulation among them, which shall
 bring foorth the most profitable and bene-
 ficiall fruites for their ioynt stock."27

 But land for the settlers and profits for
 the stockholders were affairs of the future,
 and both were dependent upon the skill
 and speed with which the planters could be
 molded into an efficient labor force. It was
 of the utmost importance, therefore, that
 the Company establish its authority in Vir-
 ginia and maintain discipline, and for the
 achievement of these purposes the Com-
 pany was not content to rely simply on the
 self-discipline it hoped would be the by-
 product of the effort to obtain profits. The
 first step was taken with the issuance of
 the new charter of 1609. During its first
 three years in Virginia, the Company felt,
 'experience of error in the equality of Gov-
 ernors, and some out-rages, and follies com-
 mitted by them, had a little shaken so ten-
 der a body." To avoid the evils of divided

 erty to reforme and correct those already
 discovered, and to prevent such as in the
 future might threaten us . . . under the

 conduct of one able and absolute Gover-
 nor."28 But changes in the formal structure

 of authority were not sufficient.

 Religion, too, was counted upon to do its
 part in maintaining order. Doctrinal con-
 flict was minimized from the start by the
 ban on Catholics, but what really distin-
 guishes the role of religion under the Vir-
 ginia Company was its conscious utilization

 for disciplinary purposes. No less an au-
 thority on colonization than Richard Hak-
 luyt had pointed to the advisability of tak-
 ing along "one or two preachers that God

 may be honoured, the people instructed,
 mutinies better avoided, and obedience the
 better used."29 The Company was quick to
 take the hint. Religion was used to screen
 prospective planters before their arrival in
 Virginia, and it was used to discipline them
 after their arrival. "We have thought it
 convenient to pronounce," stated the Com-
 pany in a broadside of 1609, "that . . . we
 will receive no man that cannot bring or
 render some good testimony of his religion
 to God. "30 And during the time that Sir
 Thomas Dale's code of laws was sovereign
 in Virginia-from May, 1610, to April,
 1619-the settlers were marched to church
 twice each day to pray for relief from dis-
 sension and for the showering of blessings
 upon the shareholders:

 O Lord. . . defend us from the delusion of the
 devil, the malice of the heathen, the invasions
 of our enemies, & mutinies & dissentions of our

 In a society of ranks and orders, defer-

 ence is owed to certain persons by virtue of

 their social position, and the Company at-
 tempted to maximize the potentiality for

 discipline in such an arrangement by ap-

 pointing to leading posts in Virginia those

 persons to whom obedience was due be-

 cause of their high status. Insofar as it was

 possible, the Company selected only per-

 sons of high birth to be governor; when it

 was not possible, as in the case of Governor
 Yeardley, it quickly, and it seems surrep-

 titiously, secured for him a knighthood.32

 And at all times the governors were urged

 to surround themselves with the pomp and

 circumstance of high office, the better to

 impress the governed. "You shall for the
 more regard and respect of yor place," read
 the Company's instructions to Sir Thomas
 Gates,

 fresh their mindes that obey the gravity of those
 lawes under wch they were borne at yor dis-
 crecon use such formes and Ensignes of govern-
 ment as by our letters Pattents wee are enabled
 to grant unto you, as also the attendance of a
 guarde uppon your pson.33

 Ultimately, however, the Company re-

 lied upon a military regimen and upon the

 imposition of force to obtain labor disci-
 pline. Governor de la Warr had been in-
 structed that his men were to be divided
 into groups and placed under the charge of

 officers "to be exercised and trayned up in
 Martiall manner and warlike Discipline."34
 Settlers were forbidden to return to Eng-

 land without permission, and their letters
 were sealed and sent first to the Company
 in London before being forwarded.35 But

 army at the behest of the Company. Dale

 supplemented the usual list of religious of-

 fenses and crimes against the state and the

 person with a series of enactments designed

 to protect the Company's interests. Slander

 against the Company, its officers, or any of
 its publications; unauthorized trading with

 the Indians; escaping to the Indians;

 theft; the killing of any domestic animal

 without consent; false accounting by any

 keeper of supplies-all were punishable by

 service in the galleys or death. Failure to
 keep regular hours of work subjected the
 offender to the pain of being forced to lie

 neck and heels together all night for the

 first offense, whipping for the second, and

 one year's service in the galleys for the
 third.36

 Moreover, Dale created a military rank

 for every person in Virginia and specified
 the duties of each in such a way as to pro-

 vide us with important clues into the na-
 ture of labor discipline and what was ex-

 pected to provide the motivation to work.

 degrees of freedom now affected the rights

 and obligations of persons. No longer could

 relations be determined exclusively by the

 positions persons held within a single sys-

 depended on their position within the or-

 ganization. In this respect, the contrast be-
 tween Dale's Code and the first set of laws

 the settlers were able to enact for them-

 selves at the General Assembly of 1619 is

 startling. For then, considerations other
 than status within an organization were

 fundamental:

 both forenoon and afternoone.... And every-
 one that shall transgresse this lawe shall for-
 feicte three shillinges a time to the use of the

 The fact is that the reforms the Com-

 pany instituted in 1609 were not sufficient

 either to swell the supply of labor migrat-
 ing to Virginia or to motivate the planters

 who were there to work with the will the

 Company expected. The Company had

 hoped that by its reforms it would be able

 to obtain not "idle and wicked persons;

 and husbandmen."40 And so dissatisfied
 had the settlers become with their situation

 that, in a letter smuggled to the Spanish

 ambassador in London with the connivance
 of English sailors, Don Diego de Molina,

 the prisoner in Jamestown, reported that

 "a good many have gone to the Indians

 . . . and others have gone out to sea . . .

 and those who remain do so by force and

 are anxious to see a fleet come from Spain
 to release them from this misery."'41 The

 hope that Don Diego attributed to the col-

 onists was, no doubt, the wish of a patriotic

 Spaniard; but it is nevertheless true that

 some settlers did flee to the Indians, that
 the Company did succeed in obtaining au-

 thority to deport to Virginia those settlers

 who had escaped back to England, and that
 Coles and Kitchins, who had been Don Di-
 ego's guards, were executed in 1614 for or-
 ganizing a plot to escape to Florida.42

 Nor did the concessions granted to su-

 perior colonists in 1614, including a kind of
 modified right to private property and some

 ment, the Company decided to pin its hopes
 on a quick return. The key to profits, it
 felt, lay in raising the value of the Com-
 pany lands through increasing population
 and in diversifying products through the
 importation of labor skilled in many trades.
 The success of the effort, obviously, rested
 upon the strength of the additional induce-
 ments that could be offered to both inves-
 tors and potential emigrants.45

 As always, one of the principal devices
 used by the Company to attract labor and
 to increase productivity was that of easing

 the terms on which land could be acquired.
 The effect of the reform was to create with-
 in the Company a new group of statuses

 differentiated from one another in terms of
 the amount of property attached to each or
 the length of time required to obtain land
 on the part of those who were not yet en-

 titled to it:

 1619 to make a final effort to create of Vir-
 ginia the profitable investment it had al-
 ways hoped it would be, took his advice to
 heart. Though it was faced with declining
 financial resources, with internal bickering,

 No doubt the chasm between expecta-

 tion and reality contributed to the planters'

 alienation from the organizational relation-

 ship into which they had been lured by the

 Company's promises. But that relationship

 was affected even more by the development

 of a network of relations that followed in-

 evitably from the inducements to get men

 into the Company.

 taneous possession of these statuses in-

 volved the holder in a network of relation-

 ships, some congruent and some incompati-

 ble, with his organizational relationship.

 Once the men in Virginia had been bach-

 elors who lived in Company-provided bar-

 racks. Now they lived in private houses

 with their families, and, though the Com-

 pany attempted to make use of the new

 relationship by penalizing each "Master of

 a family" for certain crimes committed by
 those under his authority54-hoping thereby

 that the master would use his authority to

 suppress crime-it can hardly be doubted

 that its action involved the head of the fam-

 ily in a conflict of loyalties.

 Once all persons had been equal before

 Company law, and penalties had been in-

 flicted solely in accordance with the nature

 of the offense. Now, the General Assembly
 found that "persones of qualitie" were "not

 to commandeer his servants. Even officers

 of the Company, expected to administer its

 program in Virginia, saw the chance to

 subvert it to their own purposes; "The

 servants you allow them, or such as they

 hire," Captain John Smith told the Com-

 pany, "they plant on their private Lands,
 not upon that belongeth to their office,

 which crop alwaies exceeds yours." Indeed,

 it became increasingly difficult to get plant-

 The increase in private wealth tended to

 subordinate status in the Company to sta-
 tus in a different relationship among the

 planters. The muster roll of early 1625

 But that was only one aspect of the re-

 lationship. Conditions in Virginia were now

 more fluid than they had been, and persons

 of low estate might also rise. Secretary of

 State John Pory wrote Sir Dudley Carle-

 ton that "our cowekeeper here of James

 citty on Sundays goes accowtered all in

 freshe flaminge silke; and a wife of one

 that in England had professed the black

 arte, not of a scholler, but of a collier of

 Croydon, wears her rought bever hatt with

 a faire perle hat band." The Company was

 opposed to such unseemly displays of

 wealth on the part of persons of low es-

 tate,61 but it could not prevent them.

 The ultimate stage in the transition of

 Virginia from organization to society was

 reached when the settlers came to feel that

 and the Companie is poore and Cappes is poore
 already, & poorer he will be if he follow this
 course.

 Like other men, planter Capps believed

 that "Charity first beginnes at home," and

 he divorced his own interest from that of

 the Company:

 I will forsweare ever bending my mind for
 publique good, and betake me to my own profit

 From general discontent it was but a short

 step to ridicule of Company officials and
 outright refusal to accept a Company as-

 his zeale he would add knowledge of this Con-
 trey.64

 In 1607 there had been no "Contrey,"

 only the VTirginia Company. It was the

 Company's fate to have created a country

 and to have destroyed itself in the process.

 More than a century later, James Otis

 wrote bitterly: "Those who judge of the re-

 ciprocal rights that subsist between a su-

 preme and subordinate state of dominion,

 by no higher rules than are applied to a

 corporation of button-makers, will never

 have a very comprehensive view of

 them."'65 His comment was intended as an

 observation on contemporary political af-

 fairs, but we can detect in it a verdict on

 the past as well.

 The Company had been faced with the

 problems of motivating its members to

 work for the ends which it was created to

 achieve and, at the same time, of maintain-

 ing the discipline that was essential for its

 organizational integrity. The solution it

 adopted for the first problem made it im-

 possible to solve the second; and the bur-

 den of achieving order and discipline now

 became the responsibility not of an organ-

 ization but of a society.

 Among the papers in the Sackville collec-

 tion is a document entitled "A Form of

 Policy for Virginia," written when it was

 already apparent that the Company had
 failed. The proposal was never adopted,

 but it is significant nonetheless, for, as Pro-
 fessor Fernand Braudel reminds us,

 victorious events come about as a result of
 many possibilities, often contradictory, among
 which life finally has made its choice. For one
 possibility which actually is realized innumer-
 able others have been drowned. These are the
 ones which have left little trace for the histori-
 ans. And yet it is necessary to give them their
 place because the losing movements are forces
 which have at every moment affected the final
 outcome.66

 64Ibid., pp. 71, 237; see also ibid., pp. 455-57.

 65 The Rights of the British Colonies asserted and

 The significance of the document, drafted

 as a royal proclamation, lies in its aware-

 ness of the problems of motivation and or-

 der, in its realization that they could no

 longer be solved by instructions handed

 down through a chain of command, and in
 its conscious application of particular so-

 cial inventions to solve them:

 Wee . . . knowinge that the perfection and
 happinesse of a commonwealth, lyeth . . . first
 and principally in the government, consisting
 in the mutuall duties of commandeing and
 obeyeing, next in the possessing thinges plenti-
 fully, necessarie for the life of man, doe pro-
 fesse that . . . we intend wholely the good of
 our subjects . . . endeavouringe to cause both
 England and Virginea, to endowe each other
 with their benefittes and profitts that thereby
 layeing aside force and our coactive power, we
 may by our justice and bountie marrye and
 combinde those our provinces to us and our
 soveraigntye in naturall love and obedience.

 The problem of order was solved by the

 meticulous enumeration of every social
 status that was to exist in Virginia, with a
 specification of the rights and obligations
 that inhered in each. The problem of mo-
 tivation was solved by the granting of both
 economic rewards and social privileges to
 each status and by the opportunity given
 to move from one to another:

 The meanest servant that goeth (God soe
 blessing him and his endeavours, that hee can
 purchase and [an] estate in England or com-
 passe to carrie over or drawe over with him of
 his friends and adherences the number of 300
 men) he may become a lord patriot which is
 the greatest place the commonwealth canne
 beare.

 The problem of consensus was solved
 through devices to enhance the mutual af-
 fection of persons in these statuses:

 To the end that love may be mayntayned,
 and that theise degrees may not estrange the
 upper orders from the lower, we wish that the
 heires and eldest sonnes of the upper orders
 may marrie with the daughters of the lower
 orders.... And that the daughters of the upper

 There seems little room for doubt about

 eral applicability.

 some of the conclusions we have drawn:
 that the character of seventeenth-century
 North American society was shaped deci-
 sively by the fact that, in contrast to the
 situation in Latin America, the creation of
 the society was accomplished through the
 recruitment of a voluntary labor force;
 that higher statuses in that society were
 created as a result of the need to induce
 persons to accept positions in lower sta-
 tuses; and that the behavior of persons in
 that society was determined not only by
 opportunities for advancement, as Whig-
 gish interpreters of our history would have
 us believe, but, as well, by the fact that
 these opportunities were less than people

 had been led to expect.

 With respect to more general hypotheses,
 it may be suggested that the mechanism by
 which the change from organization to so-
 ciety was accomplished lay in the very ef-
 fort to apply the blueprint that was in-
 tended to govern the relations between
 persons, for this so multiplied the number
 of statuses persons held, and therefore the
 relationships in which they were involved,
 as to alter their behavior in a decisive
 fashion.

 The testing of these hypotheses, of course,

 would involve the examination of still other
 consciously selected historical situations
 for the purpose of comparison-the experi-
 ence of the British in establishing other
 colonies in North America and in coping
 with a totally different problem in India, of
 the French in Canada and the Spanish in
 South America, of the reasons for the dif-
 ference between the blueprint in accord-
 ance with which utopian communities were
 planned and the outcome of their establish-
 ment, and the like. Herein lies the design
 for a research in historical sociology.

 Written in the margin of the document,
 by whom we do not know, is a lengthy
 commentary. Concerning the importance of
 status and order, the following is written:
 "This maintenance of theire degrees will
 immoveably fixe the frame of the collonie."
 Concerning the importance of mobility and
 motivation, the following is written: "Soe
 framinge the government that it shall give
 all men both liberty and meanes of riseinge
 to the greatest places and honours therein,
 whereby they will receave such content
 that they will all strive to maintaine it in
 the same forme we shall now settle it."67

 Shakespeare had written:

 Take but degree away, untune that string
 And hark, what discord follows.

 The author of the document agreed. He
 rested his hopes for stability on the attach-
 ment of each person to a position in which
 recognized rights and responsibilities in-
 hered. What he did not realize is what may
 be learned from the history of the Virginia
 Company-that each man is attached to
 many positions, that each position involves
 him in a separate relationship that imposes
 its own necessities, and that his behavior is
 the product of all the positions he holds
 and, because he has a memory, of all the
 positions he once held.
