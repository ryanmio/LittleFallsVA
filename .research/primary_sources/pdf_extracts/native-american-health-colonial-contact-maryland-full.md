 Abstract This study examined the skeletal remains of two different native groups,
 the Piscataway (Algonquian) and the Susquehannock (Iroquoian), who resided in
 close geographic proximity in the Tidewater-Potomac region of Maryland in order to

 understand their health during the 1,600 s CE. Both groups had differing interactions
 with colonial settlers and numerous historic accounts of violence. The results show

 some evidence of infectious disease and no types of interpersonal violence on the

 skeletal remains of either group. Other health disparities found were associated more

 with cultural and behavioral differences between these two ethnic groups than with
 direct colonial involvement.

 Introduction

 Investigations into European interactions in the New World (e.g., Alchon 2003; King
 and Chaney 2004; Loren 2008; Silliman 2005) have dispelled the idea that early
 colonial encounters with Native Americans were uniform. Many of these early

 interactions varied because of the national origin of colonists, the proximity of Native
 American communities to colonial settlements, as well as the interpersonal and
 political relationships between natives and colonists (Alchon 2003; Loren 2008).
 One way to evaluate the consequences of European contact on different Native

 American groups involved in early colonial encounters is through changes in skeletal

 health. In order to understand the differing effects of the contact experience, I

 evaluated the skeletal remains of two ethnically and linguistically different native
 groups, the Piscataway (Algonquian) and the Susquehannock (Iroquoian), who

 resided in close geographic proximity on Piscataway Creek in the Tidewater-Potomac
 area of Maryland (Fig. 1). While both groups were in contact with colonists during
 the 1,600 s CE, each had differing access to local resources, recorded ethnohistoric
 accounts of violence, as well as relationships with colonial settlers.

 Historic and ethnohistoric accounts of colonial interactions in this area describe a

 longer history of disadvantageous circumstances for the Susquehannock people, such
 as village decimation from disease and intertribal warfare (Axelrod 1993; Gagnon
 2004b; Jennings 1966, 1968, 1978, 1984; Simon 2003; Simon and Gagnon 2005;
 Webb 1995). These accounts also note fewer problems among the Piscataway peoples
 who may have been considered a "client" tribe (i.e., a trusted friendly tribe and
 trading partner) of the Maryland colony (Axelrod 1993; Jennings 1984; Porter 1979;
 Potter 1993; Simon 2003; Simon and Gagnon 2005; Webb 1995). In addition, these

 Maryland colonists, who had had come from an England embroiled in bitter conflicts
 between Protestants and Catholics, did not focus on proselytizing local aboriginal
 groups (Alchon 2003; Ferguson and Ferguson 1960; Hall 1910; Kellock 1962; Land
 1981; Maniez 1994; Menard and Carr 1982; Porter 1979; Potter 1993; Toogood
 1969). Instead, they placed importance on religious tolerance, keeping peaceful
 relations with local native groups, and using friendlier tribes as a buffer to more
 hostile ones as they acquired land. This "land-centered" contact policy by the
 Maryland colonists may have also had an impact on the health of the Piscataway
 and Susquehannock. Hence, my research documents the contact experience of these
 two native groups with the expectation that while these two groups lived in close
 spatial proximity in the Mid-Atlantic region, the Susquehannock skeletal remains
 should show more dramatic negative health consequences through greater prevalence

 of (1) disease, (2) skeletal stressors, and (3) evidence of trauma on the bones of these

 people.

 Cultural and Historical Context

 According to Porter (1979:ix), at the time of European contact, many Native Amer
 ican tribes in the Mid-Atlantic had a sophisticated political organization with a
 centralized authority. Tribes that resided in villages on the east side of the Potomac

 River were members of the Piscataway Alliance, part of the Algonquian linguistic

 group, whose material culture included construction of longhouses as permanent
 dwellings, circular palisaded villages, and ossuary burials (Kellock 1962; Land
 1981; Potter 1993; Ubelaker 1974). The Piscataway used a combination of hunting,

 gathering, fishing, and agriculture for subsistence (Ferguson and Ferguson 1960;

 Porter 1979; Potter 1993). Early European visitors to the Chesapeake Bay area noted
 that these native peoples had a seasonal subsistence strategy in which marine
 resources, animals, nuts, berries, and agricultural products such as maize, beans,

 pumpkins, squash, and green wheat were utilized (Porter 1979, pp. 9, 27).

 At the time of initial contact by British Captain John Smith in 1608, the
 Susquehannock resided near the head of the Chesapeake Bay, living in palisaded
 villages with multifamily longhouse dwellings (Gallatin 1973 [1836]; Kent 1984;
 Porter 1979). Food remains excavated from Susquehannock protohistoric villages

 included domesticated plants, such as maize, pumpkin, and squash, as well as wild

 animal, plant, and fish resources (Brashler 1987; Guilday et al. 1962), indicating a

 diet and subsistence strategy similar to the Piscataway. In addition, isotopic dietary

 reconstruction studies performed on skeletal remains indicate that maize was an
 important dietary component for the Susquehannock (Buikstra 1992; Vogel and
 Van Der Merwe 1977).

 Preliminary contact with Captain Smith led to years of peaceful interactions
 between British traders and the Piscataway and the Susquehannock, respectively.

 These relationships changed after British settlers, escaping the religious problems and

 persecution in England, settled in St. Mary's City, Maryland in 1634 on land provided
 by the Piscataway (Kellock 1962; Peasley 1910 [1635]; Toogood 1969). While the
 Maryland colonists and the Piscataway formed an alliance in which colonists used the

 Piscataway as a buffer against various Iroquois groups to the north, colonial relations
 with the Susquehannock deteriorated (Jennings 1982; Maniez 1994; Porter 1979;

 Toogood 1969). The Susquehannock, assaulted by the Iroquois tribes to the north,
 began to raid both the Piscataway tribes and the colonists. By 1652, the
 Susquehannock asked the colonial Maryland government for protection from the

 other groups to the north and a treaty of friendship, including peaceable relations with

 the Piscataway tribes, was established (Toogood 1969). In return for this colonial

 support, the Susquehannock waged war against the Iroquois Confederacy for an
 additional 20 years (Gallatin 1973 [1836]; Jennings 1968, 1982; Webb 1995).

 Decimated by the continued warfare, in 1673 the Susquehannock asked the
 colonial Maryland government for land and were invited to settle north of present

 day Washington, D.C. It is unclear if there was a miscommunication between the

 Susquehannock and Maryland government or if the proffered land was unacceptable,

 but in February of 1674 the Susquehannock instead settled 18mi (29 km) south of
 present-day Washington, DC near the Piscataway people on Piscataway Creek,
 Maryland (Ferguson 1941; Maniez 1994; Toogood 1969). Historians (Land 1981;
 Maniez 1994; Toogood 1969) are uncertain if the Susquehannock would have been

 permitted to continue living in this area if not for a series of incidents with a group of
 Doeg Native Americans during the latter half of 1675. The Doeg, an Algonquian
 speaking group, had been living farther north of Piscataway Creek in Maryland and

 Virginia. A few Doegs became involved in a dispute with a wealthy Virginia colonist

 named Thomas Mathew over trade goods, ending with a Doeg raid in which Virginia
 colonists were killed and the colonial militia was raised in retribution. After these

 events, historical accounts of Doeg and Susquehannock involvement vary (Axelrod

 1993; Jennings 1968, 1978, 1982, 1984; Porter 1979). The Doeg may have fled to the

 Piscataway Creek area where the Susquehannocks provided protection for them. It
 was also possible that the Susquehannock did not help the Doegs, but that the

 Susquehannock were mistakenly thought to be the same native group by the colonial

 militia. Either way, this incident with the Doeg initiated a siege of the Susquehannock

 fort by Virginia and Maryland colonial militia that lasted 6 to 7 weeks. After the

 militia killed five Susquehannock hostages during negotiations in September 1675,

 the siege ended when the remaining Susquehannock men, women, and children fled

 the fort, killing as many as ten of the encamped militia in the process (Axelrod 1993;

 Ferguson 1941; Kellock 1962; Toogood 1969; Webb 1995).

 The siege of the Susquehannock in Maryland had larger political consequences for

 the region. The remaining Susquehannocks retaliated for the five slain hostages by

 hassling and possibly killing a few local Virginia colonists. The Susquehannocks then

 offered a treaty of peaceable relations to the Virginia governor, Sir William Berkeley.

 Governor Berkeley rejected the treaty, but did not pursue a reprisal against the

 Susquehannock, thus adding to growing anger among colonists who feared attack

 by Native American groups in the area (Axelrod 1993; Jennings 1978, 1984). In part,
 this siege and lack of action against the Susquehannocks by Governor Berkeley

 helped another Virginia colonist, Nathaniel Bacon, and his followers incite a rebellion

 (i.e., Bacon's Rebellion) during 1676-77, which ousted the governor from colonial

 Virginia and caused destruction to the settlement of Jamestown.

 The unrest between colonists and natives that followed the siege of the

 Susquehannock fort, as well as the resulting colonial unease, strained relations with

 the "client" Piscataway tribes who now felt that they were under direct threat of local

 militia justice (Webb 1995). By 1678, relations between Piscataway and Maryland

 colonists reached a low point with accusations of Piscataway murdering colonists,

 and colonists taking two Piscataway lives in reprisal (Toogood 1969). In addition,

 historians (Axelrod 1993; Land 1981; Toogood 1969) note that the Piscataway may

 have supported the militia in the siege on the Susquehannock fort. As such, the
 deterioration of colonial relationships, continued Iroquois raiding, and fear of a

 revenge plot by the Susquehannock caused the Piscataway to flee the Piscataway
 Creek area by 1680 (Kellock 1962; Toogood 1969).

 From this archaeological and historical background information, it could be
 estimated that the Piscataway and Susquehannock had similar levels of interaction

 with the colonial settlers in the area because neither group had daily contact with or

 was under the direct control of local colonists. In addition, both groups had similar

 diets with access to local cultivated and wild food resources. These data suggest that

 the impact of European contact on Piscataway and Susquehannock health may have
 been analogous. However, with the history of warfare and violence among these

 Susquehannock peoples during the 1,600 s, I would expect that there had been many
 disruptions to their traditional way of life. These could have included fewer oppor
 tunities for a varied diet, harsher living conditions, and more negative colonial

 interactions, resulting in poorer Susquehannock health, as shown by evidence of
 disease and skeletal health stressors. Thus, my expectations were that the

 Susquehannock skeletal remains should show significant and negative health conse

 quences when compared to the Piscataway, with higher rates of infection, skeletal
 stressors, and evidence of trauma.

 Materials and Methods

 The well-preserved Piscataway and Susquehannock skeletal collections used in this

 study are curated at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Washington

 DC and primarily consist of crania. These two collections do have associated post

 crania; however, these bones were comingled post-excavation, possibly during their

 donation to the NMNH. Thus, the comingled post-crania were examined, but due to

 the loss of provenience, the focus in this research was on the crania and dentition
 with known provenience in order to address health changes between these two
 groups. Overall, all skeletal remains were estimated as adults using standard
 methods, and sex was estimated from these remains based on cranial morphology

 (Bass 1981; Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Steele and Branblett 1988; White 1991).

 Table 1 provides a summary of the minimum number of individuals (MNI) and sex
 distribution.

 The Piscataway sample was excavated from a palisaded village/fort (18PG40-A1)
 in 1939 by avocational archaeologist Alice L. Ferguson. This site is believed to be the
 principal location of the Piscataway after moving in 1623 from their village of
 Moyaone and represents a typical Algonquian palisaded village of the era (Curry

 1999; Potter 1980; Stephenson et al. 1963). The burials consisted of a small ossuary

 of adult remains (w=93), likely representing a time span of approximately 50 years or

 less in the Piscataway Creek area because of the short lifespan of the village (i.e.,
 1623-80) (Curry 1999).

 Prior skeletal analyses were performed on these Piscataway burials by Stewart,

 assistant curator for physical anthropology at the NMNH at the time. He collected

 information over cranial size and nonmetric traits and used this data to show potential

 familial relatedness and compared the Piscataway burials to other ossuary samples in

 the area (Ferguson and Stewart 1940). He also noted the presence of some patholog
 ical conditions including: dental carious lesions (cavities), generalized periosteal

 reaction (new bone growth on the outer table of long bones), and three fractures

 from two femora and one tibia. While these trauma were noted in Stewart's study, I

 only found the fractured and well-healed tibia, likely caused by accidental trauma, in

 the current collection at the NMNH (Simon 2003).

 The Susquehannock sample was excavated by Ferguson in 1940. The remains

 from this site come from a square palisaded fort (18PR8) (a building style
 adopted by the Susquehannock after various colonial interactions) and inhabited
 during 1674-75 (Axelrod 1993; Ferguson 1941; Jennings 1968, 1978, 1982;
 Potter 1993; Toogood 1969). Within the fort, Ferguson (1941) excavated a pit
 containing the complete remains of multiple adults (n=40), which likely represent
 the culmination of 2-year occupation of the fort and subsequent siege-related
 deaths. In addition, Ferguson (1941) noted four adults with advanced signs of
 treponemal infection, which I found three in the NMNH collections (Simon
 2003).

 As bioarchaeological studies often use the evidence of infection, dietary and
 metabolic skeletal stressors, and trauma as a way to measure the impact of European

 interactions on Native Americans, the examination of skeletal remains in this study
 was analogous to prior European contact studies (e.g. Baker and Kealhofer 1996;
 Larsen 2001; Larsen and Milner 1994). To evaluate the health effects on the

 Piscataway and Susquehannock peoples, I collected three types of data: (1) specific

 evidence of skeletal infection (e.g. treponemal infection), (2) skeletal stressors in
 volving diet (i.e. dental carious lesions, antemortem tooth loss (AMTL), dental
 alveolar abscesses) and metabolism (i.e. dental linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH),
 porotic hyperostosis, and cribra orbitalia), as well as evidence of (3) trauma (i.e.
 accidental and interpersonal).

 Each skeletal element was examined macroscopically for the presence or

 absence of a pathological condition following traditional bioarchaeological
 methods (Bass 1981; Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Larsen 1997; Ortner 2003;
 Ortner and Putschar 1985; Steinbock 1976). Conditions were noted either for an
 individual (i.e. infectious disease, porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia, and
 trauma) or for an individual's dentition on a per tooth basis (i.e. dental caries,
 AMTL, dental abscess, and LEH) and then these data were combined into tooth

 types (i.e. incisors, canines, premolars, molars). Evidence of infection on the
 crania was recorded if it fit the patterning and location used to reconstruct
 known types of skeletal infectious disease. Dental caries were examined by
 using a macroscopic and microscopic examination, noted as present if a lesion
 perforated the enamel on an otherwise intact tooth, and no data was taken from
 damaged teeth or teeth with damaged enamel. For AMTL, only maxillary or
 mandibular remodeling with healing was listed as present for this condition
 since teeth may have fallen out or been lost due to problems during excavation
 and/or museum curation. Dental abscessing was noted as present when the
 alveolar wall of the maxilla or mandible was perforated, and showed bony
 reaction indicative of response to the infection. Dental LEH scored as present if
 lines of disruption in the enamel were noted. Porotic hyperostosis and cribra

 orbitalia were each only noted as present if there was bilateral porosity on
 crania. Evidence of trauma, if present, was recorded for each skeletal element
 and noted as healed, partially healed, or unhealed.

 Analyses of data collected by individual for cranial evidence of infectious
 disease, porotic hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia, and trauma were performed using
 a two-by-two contingency table comparison with the chi-square statistic for
 significance (p>.05). Generalized estimating equations (GEE), a type of logistic
 regression with nested sampling, was used to compare dental information from
 each individual. GEE is an appropriate statistical analysis for the dentition
 because of the scalar issues involved in choosing between individuals (only

 one score of present/absent) or teeth (possibly as many as 32 per person) as the
 unit of comparison (Becker 2012; Gagnon 2004a, 2006; Gagnon and Wiesen
 2011; Liang and Scott 1986). Dental data comparisons performed only by
 individual may result in loss of very specific pathology data, as well as have
 insufficient results to address research questions. However, if the condition is

 calculated on a per tooth basis, one individual with multiple affected teeth may
 result in inaccurate statistical results and violate the independence of data
 required for many statistical tests (e.g. two-by-two chi-square comparison).
 GEE addresses these issues, retaining the categorical dependent variable (pres
 ence or absence of a dental condition) while keeping the teeth of an individual

 linked. It also adjusts for scalar issues of sample-effects using model estimates
 of population parameters by weighting the value of each dental pathology per
 tooth type (i.e. incisors, canines, premolars, molars, and all categories com
 bined) according to how much information is provided about the individual.

 These dental data results were calculated in SAS 9.2 with the Wald test to see

 if there was a statistically significant relationship (p>.05) with a dependent
 variable (Liang and Scott 1986). Using these methods, the program generated
 frequency estimates between each population, as well as between the sexes,
 using model-based combinations of model parameter estimates. Then compari
 sons were performed between each skeletal collection, Piscataway or
 Susquehannock, using differences in the prevalence of cranial infection, skeletal
 stressors (dental caries, AMTL, dental abscess, LEH, porotic hyperostosis, and
 cribra orbitalia), and evidence of trauma (accidental and interpersonal from crania

 and dentition) with the chi-square statistic testing for significance at a .05 level or

 greater.

 Results

 Individuals as well as the dentition from individuals were compared for any signif

 icant differences (p>.05). Table 2 shows the result of the comparison between each

 native group.

 While not significant, evidence of infectious disease (e.g. treponemal infection)

 rates were higher in the Susquehannock group. AMTL rates in the premolar sample

 were the only statistically significant results (p=.01), with a higher frequency of tooth
 loss among the Piscataway sample in premolar teeth (24 %) than in the
 Susquehannock premolar sample (7 %). While the combined sample showed no

 other significant differences, there were similar rates of dental caries and dental
 abscesses; however, rates for AMTL and LEH were higher in the Piscataway

 population. Also not significant, porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia were found
 in greater frequency among the Susquehannock (3 % and 8 % of individuals
 respectively) than the Piscataway (no cases of either condition). Additionally, there
 were no cases of dental or cranial trauma among the Susquehannock or Piscataway.

 Susquehannock and Piscataway females (Table 3) showed no significant differ

 ences, but generally higher pathology rates among Piscataway females. Dental caries

 rates were comparable between the two groups and dental abscesses were slightly

 higher (3 %) among Susquehannock females. The prevalence of AMTL and LEH was

 much higher among Piscataway females, 8 % and 24 % respectively. In addition, only
 females from the Susquehannock sample showed evidence of cribra orbitalia, and
 there was no evidence of cranial or dental trauma.

 A comparison of the males (Table 4) indicated significant cranial evidence of
 infectious disease, with 18 % prevalence in Susquehannock males and no cases
 among Piscataway males.

 This evidence supports Ferguson's (1941) initial description of treponemal infec
 tion on Susquehannock skeletal remains. These Susquehannock males showed evi
 dence of caries sicca over 50 % percent of their skulls (Fig. 2). Caries sicca is

 observed skeletally in cases of treponemal infection, often in cases of tertiary venereal
 syphilis (Aufderheide and Rodriguez-Martin 1998; Ortner and Putschar 1985;

 Steinbock 1976). Cranial involvement with treponemal infection begins in the form

 of a gumma or gummatous lesion that necroses the outer table of bone and diploe and

 inner table perforations occur occasionally in the final stage of lesion formation
 (Fig. 3) (Aufderheide and Rodriguez-Martin 1998; Ortner and Putschar 1985;
 Steinbock 1976). While the destructive process is ongoing within the center

 Fig. 3 Susquchannock male (NMNH no. 383662), arrows point to perforations of the inner table of the
 cranium due to caries sicca, inferior view

 depression of the gumma, healing usually occurs around the outer perimeter, and
 multiple healed and reactive lesions scar the cranium and produce the "worm-eaten"
 appearance (Ortner 2003).

 In addition to the evidence of cranial infection, Piscataway males had significantly

 higher rates of AMTL in premolars (31 %) than Susquehannock males (6 %), similar
 to the sample not divided by sex. While other dental conditions were not significant,
 rates for dental caries and dental abscesses were comparable between males from the
 two groups. As was also noted in the female sample, AMTL and LEH had higher
 rates among Piscataway males. There was also one case of porotic hyperostosis from
 a Susquehannock male and no evidence of trauma in either group of males.

 Discussion

 Skeletal indicators of disease, stress, and trauma can be used to map differences in the

 contact experience (Baker 1994; Baker and Kealhofer 1996; Gagnon 2004b; Larsen
 1991, 2001; Larsen and Milner 1994; Ramenofsky 1987; Simon and Gagnon 2005;
 Verano and Ubelaker 1992). This study evaluated the idea that due to cultural,
 behavioral, and contact differences, there should be significantly higher rates of
 disease, dietary and metabolic skeletal pathologic responses, and trauma for the
 Susquehannock than for the Piscataway. The anticipated higher rates of infection
 were found in the Susquehannock population, with significant evidence of infectious
 disease among males with three of 17 Susquehannock males showing infection and
 no cases in Piscataway males. The source of infection among the Susquehannock is

 treponemal infection, probably venereal syphilis with caries sicca evident on the crania.

 These data also support historic reports which indicated that the Susquehannock were
 victims of and a source of infection during the 1,600 s to other tribes, especially the

 Iroquois (Alchon 2003).

 Historians (Kellock 1962; Toogood 1969) noted no specific reports of the
 Piscataway suffering any infectious disease outbreaks, which is consistent with the
 skeletal evidence. It is possible that the Piscataway suffered acute infectious diseases,
 which did not manifest on the skeletal remains (Wood et al. 1992). However, with the
 lack of skeletal data as well as historic evidence (Ferguson 1941; Ferguson and
 Ferguson 1960; Gallatin 1973 [1836]; Jennings 1966, 1968, 1978, 1982; Kent

 1984; Land 1981; Maniez 1994; Porter 1979; Potter 1993; Toogood 1969), it was

 unlikely that there was any major disease outbreak for the Piscataway during the
 1,600 s.

 With the dietary skeletal stressors (i.e. dental caries, AMTL, dental abscesses), the

 results were not what would be expected if the Susquehannock were under dietary

 constrictions accompanied by a harsher way of life with warfare and the stresses of

 European contact. The only significant results noted were for AMTL in premolars in

 the combined sample as well as among males with higher rates in both cases among

 the Piscataway. It is possible that cultural differences in activity (e.g. Larsen 1985;

 Milner and Larsen 1991) may account for the significant premolar AMTL differ
 ences. With 25 % higher rates of premolar tooth loss in Piscataway males than

 Susquehannock males, and with dental caries and dental abscess rates approximately
 equal, tooth loss may be explained by greater use of tobacco (Nicotana mstica)
 among the Piscataway than the Susquehannock (Winter 2001a, 2001b). The place
 ment of a plug of shredded tobacco (activated with the mineral lime) in the mouth

 near premolar dentition may have helped induce higher rates of tooth loss (Miner

 1939). Evidence of brown staining on dentition of these peoples also supports the

 possibility of tobacco use (Simon 2003). While tobacco farming is not specifically

 established historically or in the archaeological record for either the Piscataway or the

 Susquehannock, Captain John Smith (1986 [1624]) reported its cultivation and use by

 Algonquians in Virginia. Additionally, tobacco growing was widespread across this

 region, including by Virginia colonists who exported as much as 20,0001bs (9,072 kg)

 to England in 1612 (Winter 2001a, p. 3). Thus, the difference in tooth loss may be

 from tobacco use, perhaps as chewing tobacco, which was not unheard of among
 Native American groups (Winter 2001a, 2001b), and the AMTL differences could

 reflect this behavioral difference among males from these Algonquian Piscataway
 and Iroquoian Susquehannock cultures.

 While differences in metabolic skeletal responses were identified, they were not

 statistically significant. Interestingly, the rates of LEH were greater among the
 Piscataway and especially among Piscataway females. Because LEH represent a
 growth interruption in the enamel formation caused by some kind of systemic
 physiological stress (Larsen 1997), it is possible that the Piscataway weathered a

 period or regular periods of stress, possibly caused by malnutrition. In addition, the

 greater rates of LEH among Piscataway females may represent behavior differences,

 where male children had access to better foodstuffs and were treated preferentially

 when compared to female children, as has been noted among other populations with

 this type of LEH evidence (Goodman et al. 1991). Additionally, because the differ

 ences in LEH for the Susquehannock were only 2 % higher, and males had the greater

 rates, there does not seem to be any kind of sex difference in access to food resources

 among this Iroquoian group. Overall, this LEH evidence may represent another
 cultural difference between the Piscataway and the Susquehannock.

 There were also no cases of cribra orbitalia or porotic hyperostosis, both types of

 metabolic skeletal stressors, for Piscataway individuals, although there were three
 cases among the Susquehannock. One explanation for the occurrence of porotic
 hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia (associated in the New World with iron deficiency

 anemia) among only the Susquehannock may be dietaiy differences. As previously

 noted, maize was an important dietary component for the Susquehannock (Buikstra

 1992; Vogel and Van Der Merwe 1977). Because of the iron-binding effect of
 phytates in maize, the consumption of this as a staple food may have caused or
 increased rates of iron deficiency (Loren 2008), resulting in the evidence porotic

 hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia on Susquehannock skeletal remains. In addition, the
 diet of the Piscataway may have included a higher component of marine resources,

 such as oysters and fish, which are iron-rich and combated any iron deficiency
 problems commonly seen in populations with maize as a dietary staple (Loren
 2008). Potter (1993) discussed evidence of intensified oyster gathering and produc

 tion after 1,300 in Algonquian archaeological sites from the Tidewater-Potomac area.

 He noted these camps showed evidence that oysters, which would have been an easily

 procured food source in this area, were harvested with the intention of being dried for

 storage. MEDLINE (2001) and the National Institutes of Health (2002) list oysters as

 a food containing a high bioavailability of iron (six oysters contain 25 % of the
 recommended daily value of iron). A modem study by Layrisse et al. (1968)
 described cases of low iron intake with maize that were raised significantly by the

 introduction of saltwater fish (300 % greater) to the diet. Thus, even if maize was a

 dietary staple to the Piscataway people, the inclusion of high iron foods would have

 helped to combat any problems that could result in iron deficiency anemia.

 In addition, iron deficiency anemia with the skeletal evidence of porotic hyperos

 tosis and/or cribra orbitalia can be found in cases of parasitic, viral, or bacterial
 infections associated with sedentism. Previous studies (Larsen et al. 2001; Reinhard

 1992; Walker 1986) describe limited and contaminated water resources as one of the

 likely sources of parasitic infection and eventual skeletal manifestations of porotic
 hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia. The Piscataway were located next to multiple

 freshwater sources, and the absence of cases among the Piscataway may be due to

 this. Cases of porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia among the Susquehannock
 may not have been caused by an absence of freshwater sources, but instead, avail

 ability problems. Before migrating, the Susquehannock requested protection from the
 Maryland government against the Iroquois, with who they were at war. Due to this,

 the Susquehannock may not have been easily able to collect clean water or harvest

 marine resources (Gagnon 2004b; Simon and Gagnon 2005). In addition, a study by

 Simon and Gagnon (2005) showed Susquehannock health improved with the move to
 the Piscataway Creek area.

 The last measure of health was evidence of trauma, both accidental and interper

 sonal. Contrary to the expected results, there was a complete lack of trauma in both
 the crania and dentition of the Susquehannock and Piscataway populations. In

 addition, while post-crania were not formally included in this study due to the loss

 of provenience, I observed only one account of trauma, the aforementioned broken

 and healed tibia, which likely resulted from accidental trauma (Ferguson and Stewart

 1940; Simon 2003). Historic records indicate palisaded villages, conflicts, and raiding

 that took place, as well as siege of the Susquehannock by colonial forces and murder

 of both Piscataway and Susquehannock native peoples. As evidence for interpersonal

 violence is commonly found on crania (Frayer 1997; Lambert 1994; Larsen 1997),

 and the samples in this research are composed of crania, it is puzzling that no cranial

 trauma was noted in these samples.

 Excavation techniques from the 1930s by avocational archaeologist Alice
 Ferguson could be one explanation for the absence of trauma notated. However, as

 Stewart (Ferguson and Stewart 1940) reviewed the Piscataway sample, and all of the

 crania are present at NMNH from the original excavation of the Susquehannock
 settlement (Simon 2003), this cannot adequately explain the absence of cranial
 trauma. Potter (1993) argued that there was increasing evidence of interpersonal

 violence in these groups due to the palisaded villages found at the sites in this study.

 However, Larsen (1997) pointed out that these site characteristics (i.e., fortifications)

 only identify the threat of violence, and not the actual outcome. In this study, the

 absence of trauma may be interpreted as just that, an absence of violent trauma.

 Hostile interactions may not have resulted in interpersonal violence readily apparent

 on skeletal remains. In addition, the bodies of Susquehannock hostages killed at the

 start of the siege may not have been retrieved for burial within the fort. Thus, while

 the history of the area suggests violent interactions, the skeletal remains from this

 study do not show evidence of repeated conflicts.

 Conclusions

 The purpose of my investigation was to understand the health impacts of European

 contact on the Piscataway (Algonquian) and the Susquehannock (Iroquoian) in the

 Tidewater Potomac Mid-Atlantic region during the 1,600 s. Overall, I expected that

 Susquehannock health would have been worse because of greater accounts of vio

 lence and disruptions to their traditional way of life. My findings were not the

 straightforward pattern expected. Susquehannock and Piscataway cultural and behav

 ioral diversity, as well as the nature of European contact in this region, may provide
 some explanations.

 Overall, the Susquehannock showed the expected significant evidence of chronic

 disease with cranial treponemal infection, likely caused by tertiary venereal syphilis.

 They also had some kind of systemic condition and/or iron deficiency anemia with
 skeletal evidence of metabolic stress (i.e. porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia),

 albeit not significantly different from the Piscataway. Contrary to expectations, the

 Piscataway had significantly higher rates of dietary stressors (i.e. AMTL) and higher,
 but not significant, rates of dental metabolic stress (i.e. LEH), especially among

 females. In addition, both groups had similar rates of dental caries and dental abscess.

 These data support the historical accounts that the Susquehannock had health

 problems, in part due to contact with Europeans (i.e. treponemal infection) as well
 as some change in lifestyle that caused evidence of metabolic stress (i.e. porotic

 hyperostosis, cribra orbitalia). As both groups had similar rates of dental caries and

 dental abscess, and the archaeological and historic data suggest they had similar diets,

 the significant evidence of tooth loss among the Piscataway may be explained by

 masticatory behavior differences, such as the use of chewing tobacco. In addition, the

 greater rates of LEH in the dentition among Piscataway peoples indicate a systemic

 stress, such as a period of starvation, which was harsh enough to cause a lack of

 dental enamel formation. While not significant, these rates were higher among

 Piscataway females and may indicate that males were treated preferentially in re
 source distribution.

 In addition, the most puzzling of the results was the lack of interpersonal violence

 on any of the skeletal remains in this study. Historic accounts of conflicts during the

 1,600 s in the Piscataway Creek area were not reflected in the skeletal samples from

 this study. Although there were definite reports of murder and hostility at the

 Susquehannock fort (Ferguson 1941; Toogood 1969), the remains buried there do

 not seem to be direct victims of violence. In addition, evidence of violent raiding by

 other tribes and trauma on the Piscataway groups caused by colonists was not found
 on their skeletal remains.

 We know that the impacts of European contact on the health of native

 groups depended upon the particular history, nature, and frequency of that
 contact. Considering that the Piscataway were a "client" tribe of the Maryland

 government and had a history of good relations with colonists at the St. Mary's
 City settlement in Maryland, it was surprising that the biological evidence
 demonstrated few significant health differences between the Piscataway and
 the Susquehannock. Unlike some of their European colonial counterparts,
 Alchon (2003, p. 133) described British contact policy through the lens of
 commercial opportunities, with immigration and permanent settlement of the
 New World to own land and control land resources. In addition, the policy of
 "liberty of conscience," which included the freedom to worship and no official

 faith, was a tenant of the St. Mary's City colony (Krugler 2004). In this region,
 it was possible that local religious tolerance and a focus on land acquisition,
 and not on the native peoples, may have contributed to fewer negative contact
 experience impacts on these two native groups.
