 THE CAUSES OF BACON'S REBELLION

 Some Suggestions

 by WARREN M. BILLINGS*

 UNTIL a decade ago the reputation of Nathaniel Bacon as one of the great
 figures in the first century of American history seemed unimpeachable.
 Because the rebellion which he led occurred in I676, it invited historians
 to compare Bacon with the American Revolutionary patriots as an early
 champion of liberty. For many Nathaniel Bacon was a seventeenth-century
 George Washington, wlhile Sir William Berkeley represented oppressive
 royal authority, which drove "the people" to ruin as it deprived them of
 their liberties. The first serious questioning of this traditional view sug-
 gested the need for a more cautious appraisal of the principal antagonists.
 A more direct challenge by Wilcomb E. Washburn reversed the roles of
 hero and villain and argued that the rebellion was best understood in terms
 of divergent views on Indian policy. More recently, Bernard Bailyn has
 advanced the opinion that the rebellion was the product of instability
 generated by the competition of rival elite groups for favor and position
 within their society. While the assault by contemporary scholars upon the
 traditional interpretation has fostered more intensive inquiry into the entire

 period surrounding Bacon's Rebellion, it has not produced an entirely satis-
 factory explanation of the rebellion's origins.'

 Although it is quite possible that some of the causes of Bacon's Re-

 bellion which have been presented are the correct ones, the proof is often
 insufficient to support them. It is the purpose of this essay both to chal-
 lenge the validity of some of these causes and to correct certain misconcep-
 tions reached in existing interpretations by using the previously un-
 exploited county court records in conjunction with other sources.

 ceding i 676 has concealed the complicated nature of the rebellion's origins.
 Three main factors rooted in these fifteen years created a potentially ex-
 plosive situation: first, the instability bred by a decentralized institutional
 framework and rapid, though uneven, political and social mobility; second,

 a gradually deteriorating economy which eventually made even subsistence

 living difficult for many planters; finally, Sir William Berkeley's diminished

 control over the colony because of the decline in his personal prestige. If the
 composition of the General Assembly of June I676 is examined in light of
 these factors, the importance of that Assembly as a body bent on radical
 reform tends to disappear.2

 The most striking features of Virginia's political institutions before I676
 were the lack of centralization and the consequent relative impotence of the
 House of Burgesses. Most scholars, either as a result of their zeal in por-
 traying Berkeley as an archtyrant or their quite natural interest in elabo-
 rating the morphology of representative government, have missed two
 fundamental points which bear directly upon interpreting the causes of
 Bacon's Rebellion. By not recognizing the decentralized quality of the
 relationship between local and provincial government, it is easy to assume a
 greater control by the latter than actually existed. This oversight also
 obscures the fragmented character of political power; elevating the House
 of Burgesses to a preponderant position conveys the impression tllat the
 locus of power resided there and in Governor Berkeley's hands. Berkeley's

 failure to call new elections, after i662, and the influence which Berkeley

 wielded over the House made it appear that he used the power of his office

 and a pliable House to implement policies and programs which did not find

 favor with those outside the government at Jamestown. With this in mind,

 it would appear that those persons identified by Professor Bailyn as a new

 elite were denied access to power which they deemed their right by virtue

 of their superior position within society. It could therefore reasonably be

 argued that such persons availed themselves of the opportunity presented in

 I 676 to seize forcibly what they considered their due. Yet it is demonstrable
 that all of these assumptions are erroneous because they overlook the

 21n The Southern Colonies, pp. 360 ff., Wesley Frank Craven commented upon the com-

 plexity of the events surrounding the coming of Bacon's Rebellion and cautioned against seeking
 simplistic answers. The eighteenth-century historian Robert Beverley suggested that the re-
 bellion derived from long-range causes. This perceptive suggestion provides a basis for the general
 thesis developed in this article. See Robert Beverley, The History and Present State of Virginia,
 ed. by Louis B. Wright (Chapel Hill, I947), pp. 74-78.

 decentralization of political institutions and because power is thought to be
 located in one place instead of being distributed in several.3

 Nearly twenty years ago Wesley Frank Craven hinted at the decen-

 tralized nature of seventeenth-century Virginia political institutions. To him

 one of the most arresting aspects of the colony's development was the rapid
 expansion of county government in the two decades after I640. Prior to
 that year the colony had been confined to a ten-county area whose center
 was Jamestown. But by I668 the number of counties had doubled, owing
 to an extension of settlement produced by an enormous growth in popula-
 tion, and the new counties were at a greater distance from the capital. For
 a variety of reasons the county court had become by i66o the agency of
 government which exerted the most direct influence upon the local planter.4

 This increased reliance upon the county courts enhanced the position of
 the justice of the peace. The office became the instrument with which
 leading men in the various localities carved out political domains for them-
 selves. More importantly, the enhanced position of the justice of the peace

 led to the formation of a variety of interests, which often conflicted with one

 another in particular counties and in the colony as a whole.

 In his analysis of Virginia's political and social structure in the two
 decades preceding I676, Professor Bernard Bailyn identified two elite
 groups. One group, composed of the most successful among a new wave
 of immigrants who came to Virginia after I640, was closely allied to

 Governor Berkeley on the basis of kinship and personal ties. This group
 Bailyn saw as a force for political stability. A second group, which also
 consisted of post-I640 arrivals, was less successful and was denied access to
 lucrative provincial offices. The competition between these groups for
 position partially explained the coming of Bacon's Rebellion. Although
 such an analysis is more sophisticated than that offered by traditional

 scholarship, it does not adequately convey the complicated arrangements

 that existed. The two groups which Bailyn identified in reality included a

 number of smaller groupings. Each county had an identifiable elite made

 up of the J.P.'s. The immediate circle of friends around Berkeley repre-

 sented yet another elite. All of these groups shared certain attributes: family

 connections, large land holdings, substantial economic position, and some

 type of political office. What they did not share, however, was a sense of
 political unity.5

 The importance of localism in Virginia's politics and institutions and the
 divergence of interests within the county elites cannot be overemphasized.
 Both factors began to mature during Berkeley's first administration. They
 became established during the Interregnum, and Sir William did nothing
 upon his restoration to alter the form which these developments had as-
 sumed. Those men making up the county courts in i66o retained their

 offices after that date.6

 Throughout the period of the county courts' expansion, the House of

 Burgesses underwent no comparable transformation. Indeed, it was not
 until after Bacon's Rebellion that the House began to emerge as an effective
 counterweight to the power exercised by other institutions. Until Lords
 Culpeper and Howard challenged the House in the i68o's, its position in
 relation to the governor and the Council lacked definition. It did, together
 with the governor and the Council, perform the important task of enacting
 statute law, but surviving evidence indicates that the House played a rather
 passive role in decision-making. Where legislation touched on county

 matters, the statutes suggest that the impetus for this legislation came from
 county leaders. In the formulation of general provincial legislation, the
 surviving legislative journals seem to show that Berkeley employed Council
 members to steer the House toward the desired objective. The chief impor-
 tance of the House lay in representing the county elites. Before June I676
 no man sat in the House who was not simultaneously a justice of the peace.7

 Yet Berkeley's influence over the House should not be construed as

 undue. Since the House represented a variety of disparate county interests,
 in the absence of any party organization, some form of management was
 necessary to bring order to an essentially turbulent situation. It is to

 Berkeley's credit that during most of his second administration he succeeded

 in keeping these interests balanced. At times the House did act inde-
 pendently of Sir William, as when in I663 the membership refused to
 vote a more equitable land tax which the governor had suggested, and
 again in i666 when it rebuffed his proposal that some of the Council join
 in laying the public levy.8

 The rapid extension of county government in the two decades after I640
 created the opportunity for the swift political advancement of both estab-
 lished planters and newly-arrived men of substance. Of the justices,
 burgesses, and councillors immigrating to Virginia after i645 whose dates
 of arrival and appointment to office are known, most had been in the
 colony for slightly more than a decade before they assumed positions of
 leadership. A strategic marriage or family connection assured a step upward
 in status.9

 Equally as significant as the speedy mobility of those persons coming
 after i645 was the staying power of those families who had established
 themselves in Virginia earlier. Out of 375 people who can be identified as
 justices, burgesses, or councillors in the years i66o to i676, 32.3 percent
 either came to Virginia themselves or had fathers who had arrived in
 Virginia before I645. It was this group which provided the widows,
 daughters, and sisters who gave many of the later immigrants their entree
 into the political circles of county and colony. In effect, the established
 families were not all supplanted by the post-I 645 immigrants. They did not

 pose a barrier to mobility at the local level for new immigrants. The doubling

 of the number of counties after i 640 had created a need for men to fill county
 offices and to serve in the House of Burgesses. Immigrants of substance
 were well suited for these positions. Regardless of when he came to
 Virginia, the man who advanced to major political office served a period of
 apprenticeship in minor county offices. When such men reached the highest

 in the counties of Accomack and Northampton. Of the twenty-five J.P.'s serving between x66o
 and I676, fifteen were related through one justice, Colonel John Wise. See Jennings C. Wise,

 echelons of government, they assured the local elites' representation. In
 filling House vacancies resulting from death, retirement, or promotion, the

 justices of the peace always made certain that one of their number succeeded

 in the vacancy.'0

 What determined the selection of a particular justice as a burgess is
 difficult to deduce. Family connections may have had some bearing. In
 terms of wealth, there seems to have been little difference between justice

 and burgess. Owing to yearly meetings of the General Assembly after i 66o,
 it may be that the office was lucrative enough to be attractive, but no
 evidence exists to prove that burgesses either made fortunes or recouped

 losses from the office.11

 The control which the justices maintained in the selection of burgesses
 points up the wider control which they possessed in determining appoint-

 ments of justices and sheriffs to their courts. Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker,
 Philip Alexander Bruce, and Richard L. Morton have argued that in these
 matters Governor Berkeley exercised undue control. His powers of appoint-
 ment have been viewed by these scholars as a means to "reward richly his
 friends in the Assembly," or to use the shrievalty as a "bribe to an over-
 independent Assemblyman." In reality, it was the justices of the peace who

 wielded the greater weight in making nominations. The evidence shows that

 Berkeley customarily complied with their requests.12

 As with the sheriffs and justices, the courts possessed considerable leeway
 in naming minor county officials. In fact, the justices often took the more

 Hening, Statutes at Large, and McIlwaine, ed., Journals of the House of Burgesses. The arrival
 dates for the ante-i645 families were compiled from the sources cited in note 9. A majority of the
 375 men who were active at the time of Bacon's Rebellion arrived in Virginia between I645 and
 I66o. Persons arriving in this span of years account for 55.1 percent of the men whose arrival
 dates are known, and 8o percent of them came to Virginia after I650. For a list of the 375 men,

 ownership occurred, but no trend could be determined. Compare the membership of the House

 testimony to the justices' role in making nominations to their courts. A few examples: Thomas

 bribing Assemblymen. Compare Appendices I and II in Billings, "'Virginias Deploured

 lucrative offices for themselves. What is significant is that Berkeley did not

 perpetuate plural officeholding so much as a means of rewarding his friends
 or bribing his critics as Wertenbaker, Bruce, and Morton insisted. Rather,
 he followed an established custom which the law did not attempt to prohibit
 until June i676.13

 The point is that Berkeley's influence in local affairs has been greatly
 overrated. Far too much emphasis has been laid upon the charges of inter-
 ference levelled at Berkeley by Bacon in the several manifestos drawn up by
 the rebel or his supporters at the time of the rebellion. These manifestos

 ought to be understood for what they were - skillful propaganda documents
 which played upon latent discontent with devastating effect. Reliance
 upon these documents has diverted scholarly attention from an important
 consideration regarding Berkeley's lack of control over local affairs.

 In certain respects, circumstances caught Sir William in a double bind.
 As the crown's chief representative in Virginia, he had to be ever-sensitive
 to crown policy demands. But the governor had lived in Virginia long

 enough to know the inner workings of both politics and the economy. And he
 was sensitive to tlhe divergencies among the planters with respect to the
 conduct of local affairs and the relationship of the colony to the empire.
 The two sets of interests frequently conflicted, and yet each somehow had
 to be served. In essence, Berkeley sought to reconcile the conflicts by
 allowing the county elites a relatively free hand in local affairs in return
 for having a correspondingly free hand in designing overall provincial policy.
 Unfortunately for Berkeley and the colony, three situations militated
 against Berkeley's objective.

 Several aspects of the justices' handling of local affairs contributed to the
 upset. An intrinsic tension was inherent in the distribution of local political
 offices. Although upward mobility proceeded at a rapid pace, the fact that
 some men rose more swiftly than others created a basis for discontent.
 Moreover, when county-building, which was an artificial stimulation to
 mobility, ceased after i668, the opportunities for political advancement
 narrowed appreciably. And, as Professor Bailyn has argued, the quick
 pace of mobility before i 668 generated instability since those persons who
 rose to political and social prominence could not rely upon a long tradition
 of dominance to legitimize their claims to positions of leadership.'4

 More to the point are three other factors. Since the justices frequently

 formation of another new county until I69j (Bailyn, "Politics and Social Structure," p. I02).

 allocated for themselves the more lucrative local offices, the competition for
 those positions over which Berkeley held direct power of appointment
 probably intensified. Like the J.P.'s, Berkeley apparently relied on family
 or other close connections in making his appointments to the Council and
 the various collectorships. But there is little evidence which suggests that
 he used these positions as a means of imposing political stability on the
 colony.15

 In the counties the elites showed little community of interest. During

 the decade and a half preceding Bacon's Rebellion, county politics were
 riven by a factionalism that now appears to have no discernible pattern.
 Where factionalism emerged, it did so as a result of issues peculiar to a
 particular county. Since the burgesses were drawn from the county courts,
 and since several councilors joined Bacon's Rebellion, it is likely that some
 factional divisions emerged in the provincial government as well.'6

 Factionalism inhered in a system where a small group of men exercised

 so much unrestrained power. In the absence of many restrictions on the
 county courts' power and with constant bickering among the justices, situa-
 tions inevitably emerged which generated a great deal of friction between
 planter and justice. As small a thing as a fine for swearing in court, an
 unsatisfactory judgment in a suit, or brusque usage by a justice - these
 were the minor irritations of which a larger irritation was born. Both the

 ordinary planter and the justices were rough sorts, given to quick displays of
 temper and violent acts. It is also logical to assume that there was competi-
 tion for minor local offices since some were lucrative and all could provide
 an entree to higher offices. In all likelihood, factions developed around

 those persons who obtained office and their sponsors, and those people who

 desired but did not obtain office. Other groups formed to remedy corrupt

 practices or misuses of power by local officials, as evidenced by the post-

 rebellion grievances.17

 Abuse of the shrievalty was a fairly common occurrence, judging from

 the post-rebellion grievances and the statutes enacted between I66o and
 I676. An act of March i66i took the collecting of tithable lists out of the
 sheriffs' hands because of their frauds in drawing up the lists. Again, an
 act of March I662 enjoined sheriffs to serve warrants issued by the county
 courts, implying that they had failed to serve the warrants "for favor."
 Although the revised legal code of I662 had set specific fees to which the
 sheriffs were entitled for performing their dtuties, it does not appear that
 many sheriffs felt bound by the law. The commission sent by the Crown to
 investigate the rebellion argued that this latter grievance had never been
 brought to the attention of the secretary of the colony, but an act of the
 September i67I Assembly testifies to the validity of the complaint.18

 Other grievances were directed at problems common to certain counties.
 These grievances touched upon such matters as sheriffs h-olding office for
 more than the two years allowed by the law; justices and sheriffs pleading
 cases in their own court, a practice also forbidden by law; councilors partici-
 pating in county-court deliberations; irregular meetings of certain courts;

 drink being sold on court days; and the lack of fixed fees for attorneys.
 Although Wilcomb Washburn has argued that these grievances do not form

 an indictment of Berkeley, his casual dismissal of them as scarcely more than

 unfounded complaints by the rebels cannot be justified."9

 II

 The extent to which economic conditions in Virginia before i676 con-

 tributed to Bacon's Rebellion has never been fully appreciated. Of the

 economic causes of the rebellion commonly cited by scholars, the most

 prominent are high taxes, low tobacco prices, and the restrictive features

 of the Navigation Acts. The role which these factors played in bringing
 about the rebellion has been generally misunderstood. Thomas Jefferson

 Wertenbaker assumed that taxes were arbitrarily laid at Berkeley's insistence

 with the consent of a pliable House of Burgesses and that these taxes rose
 steadily after I66o. Similarly, he reasoned that tobacco prices declined

 19 Any set of county records that covers the period will reveal examples of the practices com-

 plained of in the county grievances. See Surry County Order Book, I672-I682 (original volume,

 County Order Book, I664-I668 (mnicrofilm copy, Virginia State Library, Richmoind), passim.
 The revised code of I662 absolutely forbade sheriffs, justices, and clerks from pleading cases in
 their courts, except where indigents or persons absent from the county were involved (Hening,
 Statutes at Large, II, 8I-82). For Washburn's evaluation of the grievances, see Washburn, The
 Governor and the Rebel, pp. 120-127.

 sharply, largely because the Navigation Acts curtailed the colony's foreign

 markets.'o

 Although tax records, or levy lists, do not exist for all of those counties
 whose records survive, enough remain to afford some gauge of the rate of
 taxation. The surviving records show that the rate of taxation per individual
 planter fluctuated considerably, indicating neither a steady increase nor
 decline. In some counties the rate per poll in I675 was lower than that
 in i 66o; in other counties a reverse situation obtained. In some years the
 tax rates increased greatly over the previous years, suggesting an extraordi-

 nary need for funds to defray the expense of government.21

 Based on this evidence, it might appear that taxation, as Wilcomb
 Washburn has contended, was more an imagined complaint than a reality.
 But such an argument oversimplifies taxation's function in bringing off the
 rebellion. Two factors account primarily for the yearly fluctuations in the
 rate of the poll tax, the colony's chief source of revenue. Since the poll
 tax was a head tax, any change in population resulted in a fluctuation of the
 individual rate. Tobacco prices also affected the rate because poll taxes were
 always paid in tobacco.22

 In a given county a tax levy consisted of two parts: funds for defraying
 the expenses incurred in running the government at Jamestown and funds
 for defraying the cost of county government. The General Assembly
 annually determined the taxes which each county had to provide for
 provincial expenses and than communicated this decision to the county
 courts. Each fall the courts met to ascertain their total tax burden and
 then instructed their respective sheriffs to collect the funds. At no point in

 this procedure did the power of the Assembly extend beyond determining
 the amount to be collected from each county for the provincial govern-
 ment's expenses. Neither the Assembly nor the colony's laws placed many
 restrictions upon the courts' power to tax. The law specified only the fees
 which burgesses, sheriffs, and clerks could collect for the performance of
 their duties, and the making of accurate tithable lists. Occasionally the
 Assembly added to a county's tax obligation by enacting legislation designed

 to meet extraordinary needs.23

 The Causes of Bacon's Rebellion 4I9

 In essence, the county courts possessed a virtually unlimited license to
 tax. This fact does not necessarily imply that the justices misused the power
 to tax; yet it is obvious that in some counties they did, since the Assembly
 saw fit in 1674 to forbid the courts from assessing "upon the people of
 their respective counties certaine summes of tobacco for paying and satis-
 fying their expenses and accomodations whilst they are holding court."
 Generally, the courts sought to reduce expenses, and for this reason the
 justices in I662 secured passage of an act by the Assembly which reduced
 the number of burgesses from each county to two. Yet efforts to reduce

 county expenses were unsuccessful, for some of the surviving levy lists show
 that the cost of county government frequently exceeded the amount re-
 quested by the provincial government for colony-wide expenses. Usually
 the payment of burgesses comprised the largest single item in the annual
 county levy, and after i 662 several counties employed only one burgess
 to represent them. Then in I669, because "severall inconveniencies have
 arisen by the Act giveing liberty to the Counties to Chuse one or two
 burgesses," the Assembly required all counties to send two burgesses to
 Jamestown. The tax situation resulting from the expensiveness of county
 government assumes an added significance in light of other financial
 burdens upon the taxpayer.24

 The price a planter received for his tobacco before i 675 is not easily
 ascertained. It seems clear that tobacco prices did decline over the fifteen
 years after i 66o. In i 66o the price of tobacco was substantial, but it began
 to decline at an irregular rate, reaching its low point by about I 668. From
 i668 until approximately 1671 prices rose slightly and then fell again,
 bottoming out in I673. In the years immediately before I676 prices began
 to pick up once more. But at no point did improved tobacco prices approach
 the levels of i66o0.

 I673, and I674 exceeded the public levy by as much as i2,000 ounds of tobacco. The same pat-

 and I675 (York County Records (Transcripts), No. 5, I672-1694, pp. 57-58, 175, 264-265;

 The actual price per unit weight of tobacco is still more difficult to
 measure. Surviving London price quotations offer an extremely crude

 approximation because they represent the offered, rather than the actual,
 sale price and because they include freight charges and duties. Evidence
 from the county records seems to suggest that the planter sold his tobacco
 at a rate three-quarters to two-thirds lower than the London price. Thus in
 I667, the year the record of the London prices beegins, a planter probably
 received eighteen to twventy-four shillings per hundredweight of tobacco,
 whereas eight years later he got around eleven or twelve shillings for the

 same quantity.26

 Traditional arguments that the restrictions on free trade imposed by the

 Navigation Acts acted as the sole depressant of tobacco prices are question-
 able. Protests against the acts by Berkeley and others in the early i66o's
 clearly indicate that these restrictive features aggravated the planters'
 economic position. But Berkeley, and later scholars, had a tendency to
 overestimate the impact of the acts upon the tobacco trade.2"

 Numerous opportunities for violating the acts always existed. Until the

 English took New Netherland in I664, the planters had direct access to
 the Dutch. Even after the seizure of the Dutch colony, the planters could
 still trade to Holland because the Duke of York allowed the New Yorkers

 access to the Low Countries. The Virginians could easily smuggle from the

 continent witlh impunity, for it appears that Berkeley's government enforced
 the acts loosely. It was not until Giles Bland became customs collector in

 233-236. It should be noted that the pattern described here is exceedingly sketchy owing to a
 paucity of data. The London price statistics do not completely conform to the pattern. This
 discrepancy is explained by two facts. First, the London prices are for only one grade of
 tobacco. Second, the other evidence weighs more heavily towards the pattern described here. For
 an evaluation of these London prices, see J. M. Price, "Notes on Some London Price-Currents,"
 Economic History Review, 2nd ser., VII (I954), 240-250.

 not profitable. According to a 1667 estimate, the majority of the planters grew only about 1,200
 pounds of tobacco a yCar (C.O. I/21, foil. I13-114); see also "A list of Virginia planters shipping

 i674 that the Virginia government began a more vigorous policy of

 enforcement.28

 The two factors which had a greater effect upon tobacco prices were the
 twin evils of overproduction and the poor quality of the product. During
 the entire decade and a half leading up to Bacon's Rebellion, Virginia's
 planters chronically overproduced their staple product. Between i662 and
 I669 tobacco imports into England rose by twenty-three percent. And in
 I676 Virginia planters paid the two-shilling export duty, levied by the

 Virginia government, on over 25,000 hogsheads of tobacco. Berkeley's
 efforts, the forces of nature, and the ravages of the Dutch raids on the
 tobacco fleets in I 667 and i 673 did not succeed in reducing the amount of

 tobacco grown.29

 Lacking more than a rudimentary knowledge of agricultural techniques,

 the planter made no discernible attempts to improve his crop. He often
 cured his tobacco improperly. As a consequence, the quality of marketable
 tobacco varied considerably. An inspection system was still years in the

 offing, and no uniform system of standards existed. Then too, the planter

 exercised little care in preparing the tobacco for export to England. He did

 not prize the hogsheads carefully, and he sometimes filled them with stems

 and trash. The shippers were no more careful in loading and transporting

 the tobacco; so it frequently arrived in England rotten or otherwise

 damaged. o

 The combination of a glutted market and an inferior product reduced the

 return a planter could expect for his labor. As early as i664, according to

 Virginia's agents in England, the price of tobacco was barely enough to
 cover the two-shilling export duty. A decade later the price had fallen so

 low that Berkeley and the Council remarked in an address to Charles II

 that the merchants "give our inhabitants soe very little for their labour as it

 will not cloath them and their Families." They also noted that the effect of
 low tobacco prices was demoralizing.3"

 Poor tobacco prices signified the degree of economic decay which pre-

 vailed by the I670's. Rising indebtedness among the planters further
 clarifies the extent of that decay. Like taxes, the amount of the planters'
 debts fluctuated annually. But it is apparent from the available evidence
 that the level of indebtedness was higher in I675 than it had been in i66o,
 with some of the largest increases coming in the interval between I669
 and i675.32

 The combination of rising taxes and indebtedness with falling tobacco
 prices caught the planter in an ever-tightening squeeze. Frequently debts
 and taxes peaked at the very times when tobacco prices were lowest. This

 situation often occurred at points of severe stress, as in the middle 'sixties at
 the time of the Second Dutch War, again in the 'seventies when the Tlird
 Dutch War broke out, and finally, when the General Assembly raised taxes
 to support agents who were lobbying against Charles II's proprietary grant

 to the Arlington-Culpeper interests.33

 The evidence concerning planter indebtedness demonstrates that all of

 the significant elements of Virginia society experienced the economic
 decline, although the impact of the decay was unequally distributed.
 Unquestionably, the members of the local elite groups were the major

 sources of credit for their less affluent neighbors. The justices, burgesses, and
 councilors owed substantial sums both to one another and to the merchants

 in England and New England for whom they were often the middlemen.

 As the slump deepened, these planters were under constant pressure to

 incur greater debts in an effort to bail themselves and their neighbors out

 of an unprofitable position.34

 Several conclusions derive from the foregoing data. Both the fragmentary

 fol. 254; Berkeley and the Council to the King and the Privy Council, July, i673, C.O. I/30,
 foll. II4-II6.

 32The methods of derivinF debt figures and their fluctuations are discussed in Billings, " 'Vir-

 ginias Deploured Condition,' pp. 159-174.

 33A,n example illustrates the point that the planter often received a bare return on his labor.
 Assuming that the average planter annually produced I,200 pounds of tobacco, an average
 planter in Surry County stood indebted for 920.6 pounds of tobacco in I673. Besides this debt,
 he owed a levy of 157 pounds of tobacco for every tithable in his household. Despite the fact
 that his taxes fell by sixteen pounds of tobacco in I674, his indebtedness rose by sixty-one
 pounds, thereby wiping out the reduction in taxes (note 26 above); debt averages compiled from
 the Surry County Order Book, 1672-I682, cases for the years I673 and I674.

 34It is evident that those persons who constituted the local political elites were also the domi-
 nant economic force in their respective counties (Billings, "'Virginias Deploured Condition,"'
 pp. I68-I73, 179, note i8).

 tobacco price information and the fairly extensive body of material on
 indebtedness in the county records attest to the depressed condition of the
 Virginia economy before I 676. The tax burden, although it became
 heavier from i66o onward, bore only an indirect responsibility for Bacon's

 Rebellion. But added to low tobacco prices and mounting debt, it made
 living even at a subsistence level difficult. In combination these three
 factors created a powerful force for discontent. Although those responsible
 for the post-rebellion grievances were in many cases rebels, this does not
 mean that the protests against high taxes were not very real to the
 aggrieved."'

 The psychological consequences which a depressed economy could
 produce should not be overlooked. Those persons who fell victim to the

 economic decline sought scapegoats to blame for their troubles. The "Long
 Assembly," which had met at least annually for eleven of its twelve years,
 became a target for criticism. Annual sessions meant that burgesses' salaries
 were a regular and expensive item in a county's budget, and in time this
 item caused considerable resentment. The Assembly had enacted costly
 and largely useless defense measures and programs to alleviate the decay
 of the colony's economy. Under these circumstances, any favoritism or
 fraud in the disbursement of taxes could have produced particularly acute

 resentment.36

 By implication, the governor came under attack since his policies had
 required the annual legislative sessions. Hard times made it easy for the
 colonists to overlook the need for Berkeley's yearly convening of the
 Assembly. And most planters probably never fully appreciated the conse-
 quences of their overproducing an inferior quality of tobacco. They failed
 to comprehend fully the effects of overproduction upon tobacco prices, but
 Berkeley's shortcomings were clear to them.

 The effects of the Navigation Acts seem mainly to have exacerbated and
 hastened an already deteriorating situation. In a larger context, the decline
 of Virginia's economy after i66o created widespread disaffection which led
 a sizable segment of people, both in and out of power, to question certain
 aspects of the existing political arrangements at all levels.

 35 Another factor appears to have made the economic pinch even more intense. Judging from

 statements which Thomas Ludwell and Berkeley made in the late 'sixties and the early 'seventies,
 the prices of goods imported from England and freight rates increased over their previous levels
 (Thomas Ludwell to Clarendon, Clarendon MSS, Bodleian Library, Oxford University, vol. 85,
 fol. 340; Berkeley and Council to King, C.O. I/30, foll. I14-II6. See also George A. Taylor to

 Traditional accounts of Governor Berkeley's administration after his

 restoration in i 66o maintain that he became more arbitrary and oppressive
 as he grew older. Where his administration has been viewed merely as a

 progression toward tyranny, it ought to be judged on the basis of Sir WVil-
 liam's ability to solve the problems confronting Virginia prior to I676.
 Rather than to argue that Berkeley became more of a tyrant over the course
 of his second administration, it is more realistic to suggest that he lost his
 capacity to convince Virginians of his ability to lead the colony out of its
 difficulties. During the 'sixties it gradually became clear that Berkeley's
 programs for defending the colony and alleviating its economic distress
 would produce no measurable results. There is sufficient evidence to
 indicate that by the early 'seventies Berkeley had lost control over much of
 the colony's affairs - a loss not solely attributable to his refusal to deal
 summarily with the Indians as the frontier planters wished in the spring
 of I676. It derived from what might be called a "credibility gap," which

 widened slowly and often imperceptibly over the decade and a half pre-
 ceding Bacon's Rebellion.

 Despite Berkeley's efforts to evolve an Indian policy which would insure
 peace, official correspondence throughout the years before i 676 indicates
 only minimal results in developing satisfactory arrangements between the
 colonists and the Indians. In the event of an Indian war, which threatened
 to break out as early as I666, the colony was scarcely in a position to
 defend itself. An equally perplexing problem arose as a consequence of

 the Second and Third Dutch Wars. Berkeley was forced to accept Crown
 demands to build a costly fort at Point Comfort, although he rightly argued
 that it would be useless there since ordnance did not possess sufficient
 range to reach attacking Dutch ships. The Crown halted more effective
 defensive measures and provided almost no help in the form of ordnance,
 small arms, and ammunition. If the dire lack of arms and ammunition
 recorded by some county militia officers is typical of conditions in other
 counties, the colony was scarcely able to defend itself against the Dutch or
 the Indians after I673.37

 Tlie Cautses of Bacon's Rebellion 425

 Just as they had attempted to deal with the defense problem, Sir William
 and his closest advisors attempted to launch a comprehensive program of
 diversification to eliminate Virginia's economic distress and to bring the

 colony more nearly in line with the prevailing mercantilist theories of empire.

 Such a program had at least four distinct advantages. It would wean the
 planters from total dependence upon tobacco, thereby lessening the chance
 that Virginia's economy would be geared to the English tobacco traders'
 interests. A diversified economy would enhance the colony's value to Eng-
 land. Finally, if Virginia's protests against the restrictions on free trade
 proved ineffectual, diversification could serve to lessen the impact of the
 Navigation Acts.38

 Success depended upon several favorable necessities: outside financial
 assistance, a supply of labor skilled in the processes called for in the di-
 versification schemes, and the cooperation of Maryland and North Carolina
 in reducing the total amount of tobacco grown. But the Crown and the
 English merchants were not eager to venture financial support. Most
 planters could not afford to employ skilled laborers, who were themselves
 unwilling to hire out, given the opportunities for advancement in Virginia.

 And cooperation was not forthcoming from the proprietors of the neigh-
 boring colonies, who were more concerned with their own interests than
 those of Virginia.39

 Berkeley's one success at removing a source of aggravation came only
 after the rebellion was under way. For years Berkeley had labored througlh
 Virginia's London agent, Francis Moryson, for repeal of the Northern Neck
 grant which Charles I had given certain favorites in 1 649. In I 672 Charles
 II gave the entire colony to Lords Arlington and Culpeper, successors to
 the original grantees, for thirty-one years. When Berkeley received word of
 the Arlington-Culpeper grant, he reacted swiftly. He reconvened the
 General Assembly in I674 and got a tax of sixty pounds of tobacco per
 tithable to send Moryson and two additional agents to lobby against the
 grant. Tlhe Assembly also raised court fees in order to provide additional

 funds. For nearly twvo years the agents produced no visible results. Then,

 niined to what degree an individual planter armed himself, it is likely that the colonists were not
 completely defenseless. But the psychological effect of a poorly-armed militia in addition to poor
 provincial defenses can readily be envisioned.

 38Recently two detailed studies of diversification have appeared: John C. Rainbolt, "The Vir-
 ginia Vision, a Political History of the Efforts to Diversify the Economy of the Old Dominion,
 I650-1706" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Wisconsin, i964) and Sister Joan

 Progress, I660-I676," William and Mary Quarterly, 3rd ser., XXIV (I967), 44-75.

 early in I676 the agents procured a proposed charter annulling the grant
 and guaranteeing the colony against any future grants. The proposed
 charter never passed the seals, for Bacon's Rebellion stayed its passage.
 Success had come too late.""

 Sir William's advancing age contributed to the decline in his effectiveness
 as governor. As early as I667 Thomas Ludwell, in a letter to the Earl of
 Clarendon, expressed concern that the governor might die in office. He
 noted that the governor was the only person named to the quorum in the
 commission of oyer and terminer. If Berkeley died, Ludwell wrote, "that

 commission is voyd and wee left without that most necessary defense against
 those crimes tryable and punishable by itt." Later that year Ludwell
 remarked in a letter to the governor's brother, John, Lord Berkeley, that
 Sir William's condition was "the saddest that ever I saw." The fear that
 Berkeley might die in office probably had an unsettling influence upon
 those persons holding commissions from the governor. Nicholas Spencer, a

 member of the Council, alluded to that possibility in a letter to his brother.

 Whoever succeeded Berkeley, he wrote, would "put al places.of proffits upon
 Sale, and he that bidds most carrys it."' 4

 Perhaps Berkeley's waspish personality made him more cantankerous to
 deal with as he grew older. As many of his close friends in the House and
 on the Council died or retired from public life, he came to rely more
 heavily upon the advice of Philip and Thomas Ludwell. Surviving evidence
 suggests that the governor could be swayed by their opinions. Giles Bland
 observed in I675 that "some interested persons who for their own private
 advantage [filled] in his Eares continually with strange stories which being
 antient [he] is apt to believe." Writing to Thomas Ludwell, who was in
 England, in April I676, the governor noted that he had only three of the
 Council to assist him and that he missed Ludwell's presence sorely.42

 Berkeley's own requests in the late 'sixties that he be replaced by a more

 vigorous person indicate that he recognized that old age had blunted his

 The Causes of Bacon's Rebellion 427

 in this time of my very old age so wish my self happy but that I presently
 repent of my desires to be so." Shortly after he wrote this letter, he began

 to solicit his recall. Berkeley apparently had contemplated retirement for
 some time, for as he wrote his friend Richard Nicolls in November, he had

 "long Begd in vaine" to be allowed to return to England. The following
 year the governor expressed once more the desire to go to England. In

 I669 he again tried to leave Virginia, but when this attempt was frustrated,
 he apparently resigned himself to staying for some time to come.43

 The governor made one last attempt to retire in the spring of I676. By

 this time the strain of trying to keep the frontier from bursting into rebel-

 lion had exhausted the seventy-year-old Berkeley. Writing to Secretary
 of State Henry Coventry, Berkeley begged him to have the king replace
 him with a more vigorous person, saying that he was "not able to support
 [him]self at this age six months longer." Before the Crown could take
 any action on this request, the governor had to quell Bacon's Rebellion.'

 Berkeley's desire to retire nearly coincides with his increasing inability

 to govern Virginia effectively. Between I669 and May I676 Berkeley's

 repeated failures in solving Virginia's problems seem to have begun to erode

 his influence among the planters. After October I669 the General

 Assembly enacted no more signlificant diversification legislation. During

 the early 'seventies Berkeley's and Ludwell's correspondence with Crown

 officials scarcely mentioned diversification. Both of these facts signify at

 least a waning of interest in the project. They may also be construed as an

 initial realization that Berkeley's plan had failed.

 But it was the Dutch attack on the tobacco fleet in July I 673, during the

 Third Dutch War, that drove the first serious wedge between Berkeley and

 his people. The colonists were already in a wretched condition because of a

 hard winter and a cattle famine the previous year. A number of people

 became restive as a result of the raid and Berkeley's failure to prevent it.

 In a memorial to Charles II, the Council found it necessary to defend

 Berkeley's government against the aspersions of "some ill affected Persons
 who [were] vexed with their losse." Berkeley's behavior during the Dutch

 invasion was "beyond what could be expected from a man of his years."

 Despite the raids, argued the Council, the governor still had "the love and
 reverence" of all the colonists.45

 Minor commotions in at least two counties during the fall of I 673 suggest
 that the governor did not have "the love and reverence" of all the Virginia

 planters. The best documented of these commotions was the refusal of some
 planters in Lawnes Creek Parish, Surry County, to pay their taxes. This
 affair has usually been regarded as a preface to Bacon's Rebellion, but it
 seems more likely that the protestors were worried more about their pocket-

 books than their liberties. What distinguishes the disturbance from Bacon's
 Rebellion is the fact that none of the persons involved in the incident can
 be identified as a rebel in i676. Furthermore, in contrast to the rebellion,
 none of the leaders of the Lawnes Creek affair was a member of the Surry
 County ruling elite. The most that can be said of this incident is that
 altlhough the people concerned chose to voice their opposition by direct,
 non-violent means, the county's leadership still remained convinced of
 Berkeley's capacity to lead.46

 Finally Berkeley's call for new elections in May i676, and the criticism

 of his leadership in the county grievances illuminates the breakdown

 of the governor's authority. Until the spring of I 676 there were few, if any,
 demands for new elections after the convening of the Long Assembly in
 December I 662. But between the adjournment of the Long Assembly and
 Berkeley's election proclamation of May IO, pressure for a new Assembly
 mounted. Nathaniel Bacon's emergence as a popular leader willing to
 challenge the governor's power threatened to eclipse Sir William's authority.

 By calling a new Assembly, he would not only "Satisfye the Importunity of
 the People in their so earnest desire for a new Assembly," but the governor
 could also use his considerable persuasive talents to woo his critics. His
 broadening of the franchise to include non-landowning freemen may be
 seen as such an attempt. That Berkeley succeeded in mastering the House of
 Burgesses is evidenced by the burgesses' petition to Charles II to "continue
 Sir William Berkeley Knight our honorable Governor." But the fact that

 only Accomack County offered him safe haven at the heighit of the rebellion

 indicates his inability to regain much of the support he had lost to Bacon.47

 The authors of the post-rebellion grievances from two parishes and nine

 counties criticized Berkeley's leadership. Most frequently the grievances
 complained that the governor had not acted either swiftly or resolutely in
 meeting the Indian threat. He had done no more than to secure the
 erection of a string of useless forts and to order that the counties "draw
 together at Least tenne able men to one house." The authors of the Charles
 City County grievances drew up a more comprehensive indictment.
 Berkeley, they claimed, was the chief cause of much of Virginia's long-
 standing unrest. He had, they argued, violated his instructions by con-
 solidating his power at the expense of the Council, the House of Burgesses,
 and local government. They might have endured many "grievances and
 pressures" had there been some visible form of return on the "vast sums" of
 tobacco raised for defense and diversification. The authors of the Charles
 City grievances also complained about the governor's slowness in handling
 the Indians, and they bitterly protested his refusal to hear petitions. While
 it is demonstrable that the governor was personally innocent of the more
 extreme criticism, the mere fact that the authors of the grievances found
 his leadership objectionable is proof of the deterioration of Berkeley's credi-

 bility as governor.

 48

 Undeniably, Berkeley had little control over a portion of the events
 contributing to his decline as an effective leader. Equally undeniably,
 Berkeley labored long and hard to relieve the difficulties confronting Vir-
 ginia. Yet exculpating him from personal responsibility for Virginia's woes
 or damning him as an arbitrary old man clouds a basic fact of political life:
 whatever good or ill emanated from the governor's second administration, it
 was he who would reap the praise or scorn of those he led. Had
 Berkeley's plans succeeded, he would have received the credit-as in
 failure he had to bear the blame.

 Since an analysis of Assembly membership can reveal significant informa-
 tion about the burgesses, and since the June, or Bacon's, Assembly is
 essential to most of the standard interpretations of Bacon's Rebellion
 because of the legislation it enacted, it is strange that none of these interpre-
 tations provides any insight into the make-up of that Assembly. The as-
 sumption generally made by traditional scholarship is that "the people"
 turned out the rascals and elected their true representatives. Then the
 "assembly of the people's hope" passed a variety of reforms which were
 overturned when Berkeley recaptured control of the colony. Bacon received
 most of the credit for those "reforms" until Wilcomb E. Washburn demon-
 strated that Bacon had little impact upon the Assembly's deliberations. But
 Washburn did not attempt to investigate the composition of the House in
 June I676. An analysis of the membership shows that where burgesses of
 the Long Assembly had lost their seats, their replacements in most cases
 represented the same interests. Known turnovers were often the result of
 issues peculiar to particular counties.49

 Out of a possible total of forty-one burgesses who could have sat in the
 Assembly if all twenty counties and Jamestown had sent burgesses,
 twenty-one men, representing twelve counties, can be positively identified.
 Two counties appear to have sent only one burgess apiece, in violation of
 the i 669 statute; and another burgess, Nathaniel Bacon himself, was re-
 moved from the House. At most, therefore, only thirty-eight burgesses
 were present when the Assembly convened. Thus the twenty-one burgesses

 identified constitute more than a bare majority of those members present.50

 The arresting feature about the known members is the continuity of
 representation of the local courts. All but four were justices of the peace.
 At least five burgesses were holdovers from the last session of the Long
 Assembly. Possibly six others were holdovers, but this cannot be verified
 because these members came from counties whose records are now lost. Four

 of the ten replacements actively supported Governor Berkeley during the

 49The phrase is Richard L. Morton's (Morton, Colonial Virginia, I, 249). Wertenbaker's
 analysis extended no further than supposing that most of the burgesses were partial to Bacon
 (Wertenbaker, Virginia Under the Stuarts, p. I69; Torchbearer, pp. io6-i24). Bruce did not
 deal directly with the question of composition, but the implication of his treatment was sixmilar
 to Wertenbaker's since he termed the June Assembly "Bacon's Assembly" (Bruce, Institutional
 History, T, 66, I5", 596; II, 572). Morton closely followed Wertenbaker (Morton, Colonial Vir-
 ginia, I, 252). Washburn's analysis begins by saying, "Very little is known about the com-
 position of that assembly," and it progresses no further (Washburn, The Governor and the
 Rebel, pp. 49-67, especially p. 49).

 50 list of the twenty-one can be found in Billings, "'Virginias Deploured Condition,'"

 rebellion, two followed Bacon, and the opinions of the remaining four are
 unknown. Among the holdovers and possible holdovers, two burgesses
 appear to have been allied with the governor, two with Bacon, and the rest

 took no discernible side.5"

 The fact that contemporary accounts convey the impression that the
 House was pro-Bacon may be due in part to the biases of the writers. The
 Assembly was probably quite unruly in light of the tensions generated by
 the threat of Indian attack, Bacon's activities, and dissatisfaction with other
 unrelated events. In such circumstances it would have been only natural
 for Berkeley and his friends to interpret the "ill-Humours" of the House
 as manifestations of Bacon's influence. Writing to Henry Coventry,
 Berkeley declared that "their [sic] was but eight of the Burgesses that were
 not of his [Bacon's] faction and at his devotion." George Jordan, who had
 been a burgess from Surry county in the last session of the Long Assembly,
 also described the Assembly as being full of "ill-Humours," and he hoped
 that "his Honor and the Councill [would] prevaile with though but seven
 or eight of the most Rationall of them." Jordan was probably bitter about
 having been turned out of the House. Since his replacement was also loyal

 to Sir William, Jordan's defeat may simply have been a result of his age or of

 some factional fight in Surry.52

 A letter sent by Isaac Allerton, a Westmoreland County justice, to
 Thomas Ludwell possibly presents a more impartial description. Allerton
 reported that "the Southern Counties sent Burgesses proportionate to their
 factious and Rebellious humours and Part of the Burgesses were of his
 [Bacon's] side apparently enough yett were mastered by some gentlemen
 of Reason." Although he too was loyal to Berkeley, the implication of
 Allerton's final words is that a number of non-Baconites maintained some
 degree of control and order in the House.53

 Considered in these terms, the June laws are easier to analyze. The act for
 defense against the Indians was more vigorous in tone than the one passed
 by the last session of the Long Assembly three months earlier. This act
 reflected some of the leverage which Bacon and his men had exerted in the
 tense days of late June. Repeal of the I 670 voting statute was not the blow
 for freedom that some of Bacon's scholarly partisans have portrayed. The

 act merely gave statutory force to what Berkeley had done on his own
 prerogative in his May i o election proclamation. Those acts aimed at
 redressing grievances are more properly regarded as responses to complaints
 which the electorate had presented to the burgesses before the Assembly
 convened than as attempts to upset existing political arrangements. Neither
 the act regulating offices, the act for choosing vestries, nor the act desioned

 to reduce abuses in the laying of the levies should be construed as attempts
 to overturn the powers of the justices of the peace.

 What these acts did try to accomplish was a reduction of local tension

 arising from the justices' frequent misuse of their position. Preventing the

 same man from being sheriff, clerk, and surveyor simultaneously could open
 up new opportunities for advancement, and it would distribute these re-
 munerative positions in a more equitable fashion. The restriction of the

 sheriff's term of ofice to one year can be seen as a means of preventing the
 sort of squabbling which frequently arose when a man held the shrievalty
 longer than the old law allowed. That portion of the act which dealt with

 the shrievalty represented a renewed attempt to curb irregulatities wh lich had
 cropped up before. The act prohibiting councilors from voting in county-
 court proceedings removed their direct interference in local affairs, and the

 elimination of the councilors' tax exemption helped to reduce a county's tax
 burden. By lengthening the time which a debtor had to pay his debt, the
 Assembly sought to ease the grip of economic depression which had lasted
 since the end of the Third Dutch War. Allowing two justices, instead of
 the governor, to sign probates eliminated a fee and a trip to Jamestown for
 an heir. In short, the June Assembly moved to calm the agitated planters
 by remedying the grievances wlhich Berkeley had solicited when lhe issued
 his election proclamation on May Io. Although Charles II nullified all
 the June Laws in the fall of I676, the non-revolutionary character of the
 acts touclhing on county affairs is proven by their subsequent reenactment

 by the General Assembly of February i676/77.5

 The June Assembly was not a force for radical change. Represented in
 it were the same disparate local interests whiclh had been evident in the

 54Hening, Statutes at Large, II, 340-365. On October 26, I676, Charles II issued a
 proclamation which, among other things, nullified the June Laws, "A Proclamation For the
 Suppressing a Rebellion lately raised within the Plantation of Virginia," Coventry Papers, vol. 77,
 foll. 263-65; Hening, ed., Statutes at Large, II, 366 ff. The General Assembly's repeal in February,
 I676/77, of the liberal franchise law enacted by the June Assembly came about as a consequence
 of Charles II's instructions to Berkeley. In a letter written in the fall of I676, the King told
 the governor that he should "take care that the members of the Assembly be elected, only by
 Free Holders, as being more agreeable to the Customs of England, to which you are as nigh as
 conveniently you can to conform yourself" (Hening, Statutes at Large, I, xx).

 Long Assembly. Some counties returned their former burgesses. Where a
 turnover in membership occurred, it is more properly explained as a conse-
 quence of local political disputes than as a consequence of the oppressed
 yeomen's desire to overthrow the existing political order. The Assembly

 passed laws designed to strengthen local government by closing the loop-
 holes in existing statutes which had provided a basis for local unrest. In

 this respect, the June Assembly performed one of the tasks for which any

 legislative body is convened.

 Although the General Assembly had attempted before June I676 to
 remedy unsatisfactory conditions, the post-rebellion grievances demonstrate

 that the Assembly had been unable to effect wholly adequate responses to

 local pressures. Until I676 the Assembly had never tried to reduce local
 tensions to the extent envisioned in the June laws. Possibly, many of the

 complaints which these laws were designed to remedy had not been

 brought to the burgesses' attention until the electorate voiced them in the

 tense days of May. More probably, however, the Long Assembly had not

 taken cognizance of the unrest engendered by plural officeholding, secret

 meetings to determine the county levies, rising taxes, and other like matters.

 But the threat of open rebellion, coupled with some changes in the member-

 ship in the newly-elected House of Burgesses, forced the Assembly to move

 quickly to calm the agitated planters. The most obvious way to achieve this

 end was to remove sources of local tension by acceding to some of the

 demands presented to the burgesses before the Assembly had convened.55

 But even this step proved ineffective because the General Assembly was

 itself a target for criticism. In the post-rebellion grievances the counties
 complained about Council members sitting in county courts and attempting

 to influence the decisions rendered there. Some evidence from the county
 records verifies this grievance. Another grievance criticized the exemption

 of the Council members and their families from paying levies. Significantly,

 none of the complaints derived from the lack of a general election after i 662.

 There were, however, universal complaints about too frequent Assembly
 sessions. Certainly this was a curious objection for people supposedly con-

 cerned with their liberties.56

 I675/76 is discussed in detail in Billings, "'Virginias Deploured Condition,'" pp. 97-I01. C.0.

 Because of general instability in the years prior to I 676, it might reason-

 ably be asked why a rebellion did not occur before Nathaniel Bacon came
 to Virginia in I674. The rebellion came when it did because by I676 the
 factors which contributed to the colony's instability coalesced to create
 a potentially explosive situation in which large numbers of people were
 psychologically prepared to rebel. Until Bacon emerged, a leader capable
 of capitalizing on the latent discontents was lacking. Even though the

 economy declined, it did not do so at a constant rate. In the years of up-
 swing some relief from high taxes and low tobacco prices was possible, but
 from i 672 on increased taxes were required to defend the colony against
 the Dutch and to support the London agents. By the early 'seventies
 Berkeley's "credibility gap" had widened. After I669 the General As-
 sembly enacted no more significant diversification legislation, a tacit ad-

 mission of the governor's failure to eliminate economic difficulties. Similarly,

 Sir William's inability to provide an effective defense for the colony stood
 out. As an issue defense had lain dormant since the conclusion of the Second
 Dutch War, but it came into focus when the third war broke out. A year
 after the third war ended the Indians put on their war paint. The feeble
 state of the colony's defenses and the static plan enacted by the Assembly in
 March I675/6 for handling the Indian raids did little to allay fears of
 actual physical harm. And underlying these problems was the unrest
 generated by uneven mobility and political factionalism.

 By the late winter and early spring of i676 a situation in some respects
 analogous to that now present in many American cities prevailed. There had
 been extended periods of economic hardship, which by I676 held only the
 prospect of greatly worsening, especially since the Indians had taken to
 the warpath. Discontent and the lack of an adequate defensive program led
 to a questioning of political arrangements, which were themselves highly
 volatile because of extremely rapid growth and local factionalism. This
 combination of circumstances tended to cast serious doubts upon Governor
 Berkeley's efficacy as a leader since his solutions to all of the problems
 confronting Virginia had failed miserably, costing the planters higher taxes
 but still exposing them to attack by the Dutch and the Indians. For the
 planters Berkeley became a scapegoat upon whom they could lay the blame
 for all problems past and present.

 In fairness to Berkeley, it must be pointed out that to some extent he

 was a victim of events over which he had only nominal control. As the
 intensely loyal representative of the House of Stuart, Sir William felt

 obliged to carry out royal policy and to follow instructions which he did
 not aways think wise. His own overconfidence in the ultimate success of

 diversification caused him to underestimate the barriers to the creation of a
 viable economy. On the other hand, he had involved himself deeply in the
 life of Virginia, as he understood some of the ramifications of the colony's
 swift social and political expansion. Essentially he seems to have viewed
 his role in politics as that of a broker seeking to conciliate a variety of

 disparate interests. The unruly nature of those whom he governed and the
 inherent instability of the colony's institutions, which kept society in
 turmoil, made his an extremely difficult role. His own advancing age and

 declining health severely restricted the governor's capacity to adjust to new

 situations with promptness.

 Berkeley's inability to recognize a new and potentially dangerous situation

 is evident in his handling of the Indian raids in I675 and I676. While he
 correctly surmised that the frontier planters had exaggerated the effects of
 the raids, Berkeley blundered by not ordering a prompt show of force on
 the frontier. His failure to act decisively focused attention on his past
 failures and made him vulnerable to charges of inactivity and corruption.
 The governor's refusal to commission a volunteer force played into the hands
 of Bacon and his friends who were willing to act outside the law.

 Bacon's importance lies not in any commitment which the rebel might
 have made to liberty or freedom. He probably possessed little feeling for
 the rights of the people. What is important about Nathaniel Bacon is that
 he emerged as a skillful agitator at a propitious moment in Virginia history.
 Unstable social and political conditions and economic hardships had pro-
 duced in the planters a sense of uncertainty and frustration. The Indian
 raids, in addition to posing the threat of actual physical harm, brought home
 once more to the planters Berkeley's failure to solve the colony's problems.
 Bacon's talent lay in consolidating the unrest by making "People ready to
 vent all their Resentment against the poor Indians."5"
