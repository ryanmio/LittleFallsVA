 I. INTRODUCTION

 GENERAL

 T Nhe Massawomeck are but one of several hinterland Indian groups

 which having made a brief, frequently violent, appearance dur-

 ing the seventeenth century, disappear. Eyewitness and contem-

 porary accounts of the Massawomeck, which are confined to the period

 1607-1634, are closely associated with the founding of the English James-

 town and Maryland colonies in tidewater Virginia. Unfortunately, ref-

 erences to the Massawomeck are brief and frequently apart from the

 mainstream of events. Often they are little more than asides, more tan-

 talizing than revealing. Henry Fleet's Journal is a welcome exception,

 but his references to the Massawomeck are also peripheral to the main

 theme which recounts his experience as a fur trader on the Potomac

 River over the period 1627-1632. This paucity of primary and contem-

 porary information has not prevented the accumulation of a sizable body

 of antiquarian and scholarly literature regarding the Massawomeck,

 much of it generated in the nineteenth century when there was a dili-

 gent, often multidisciplinary search for a Massawomeck identity which

 would classify them as one or another of the Iroquois tribes. Neither

 have twentieth century scholars let the matter rest.

 Information regarding the Massawomeck is inextricably bound-up

 with the history, ethnohistory, and archaeology of the mid-Atlantic re-

 gion and the Algonquians in the Chesapeake Bay region in particular.

 With the exception of William Fenton's work Problems Arising from the

 Historic Northeastern Position of the Iroquois (1940), Iroquoianists have ne-
 glected the Massawomeck. On the other hand, apart from Bernard Hoff-

 man's work Observations on Certain Ancient Tribes of the Northern Appa-

 lachian Province (1964), tidewater Algonquian scholars, appear reluctant

 to investigate what nineteenth-century writers believed to be Iroquoians.

 It is against this background that I seek to expand upon what is known

 of the Massawomeck in the hope that it will be possible to enhance our

 understanding of trade between the mid-Atlantic Indians in the Ches-

 apeake Bay latitudes and the Ontario Iroquois in the sixteenth century

 and the first three decades of the seventeenth century.

 of 1526 as a result of the Giovanni da Verrazano and Estavao Gomes

 2 THE MASSAWOMECK

 voyages of 1524 and 1525 and the first account of Europeans being

 present there dates from prior to 1546, the Massawomeck are not men-

 tioned, nor can they be identified, until 1607.1 In December of that year

 John Smith, a charter member of the Jamestown Council, first learned

 of the Massawomeck from Wahunsencawh, principal chief of the Pow-

 hatan in whose territory the English had founded their Jamestown col-

 ony.

 Smith records this first account of the Massawomeck in his True Re-

 lation of such occurrences and accidents and noates both hapned in Virginia

 since the first planting of that Colony, which is now resident of the South part

 thereof, till the last returne from thence. In reality this was a letter in which

 Smith recounts events which took place over the period from December

 1606 to June 1608 to "a worshipfull friend" in England whose identity

 remains unknown. Upon its arrival in England in July 1608, Smith's

 letter aroused sufficient interest to warrant its being submitted for pub-

 lication under this title on 13 August 1608. Since it was compiled before

 June 1608, references to the Massawomeck in Smith's True Relation are

 limited to his account of the information related to him by Powhatan

 while he was held his prisoner over the period December 1607-January

 1608.

 In 1612 Smith's second work, A Map of Virginia with a Description of

 the Countrey, the Commodities, People, Government, and Religion, was pub-

 lished. This work contains considerable information regarding the In-

 dians of Virginia, but references to the Massawomeck are characteris-

 tically brief. It is the annex to Smith's work, which was also published

 in 1612, which concerns us here. Entitled Whereunto is Annexed the pro-

 ceedings of tho'e Colonies, since their first departure from England, with the

 discourses, Orations, and relations of the Salvages, and the accidents that befell

 them in all their Iournies and discoveries, this annex contains several first-

 hand accounts by various Jamestown colonists. The relations by Doctor

 William Russell, Anas Todkill, and Nathaniel(l) Po(w)ell regarding

 Smith's encounter with the Massawomeck on Chesapeake Bay and with

 the Tockwogh and Susquesahanock who described the Massawomeck, all

 of which occurred in June and July 1608, are particularly germane to

 1 European interest in the latitudes of the Carolina Outer Banks and Chesapeake Bay
 in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in a large measure stemmed from the mistaken
 belief that in 1524 Giovanni da Verrazano had seen the Pacific Ocean when he had looked
 across the Outer Banks onto Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. This interpretation of Ver-
 razano's discoveries is reflected in the pinch-waisted maps of North America prepared by
 Maggiolo in 1527 (Ganong 1964: fig. 34; Wroth 1970) and Verrazano's brother Gerolamo
 in 1529 (Quinn 1979 (1): fig. 44). As a result in the sixteenth century and well into the first
 quarter of the seventeenth, Spanish, French, and English explorers concentrated their
 search for a mid-Atlantic passage through America to the Orient in these latitudes. Some
 Jamestown settlers continued to search Chesapeake Bay tributaries for this passage west-
 ward as late as 1622 (Waterhouse 1622: 8-9). Nevertheless, until Smith first learned of the
 Massawomeck in 1607, there is no evidence that can be interpreted to be a reference to
 them by that name or any other.

 INTRODUCTION 3

 this work. The invaluable map which accompanies Smith's Map of Vir-

 ginia (Fig. 1) provides the orientation necessary to comprehend his and

 contemporary works regarding Jamestown and the surrounding region.

 William Strachey2 was not present in 1607 when Smith first learned

 of the Massawomeck from Powhatan nor was he present on the recon-

 naissances of Chesapeake Bay which took place during the summer of

 1608 when Smith encountered the Massawomeck and then learned of

 their exploits from the Tockwogh Algonquians and Susquehannock Ir-

 oquoians at the head of Cheseapeake Bay. As a result, in the context of

 this work, Strachey's Historie of Travell in Virginia Britania (1612) is largely

 a paraphased repetition of Smith's works and the colonist's accounts set

 out in The Proceedings. Nevertheless, in his First Booke of the First Decade

 of his Historie, Strachey provides some new information regarding the

 Massawomeck which had not been recorded earlier.

 In 1624 Smith published his The General Historie of Virginia, New Eng-

 land and the Summer Isles with the names of Adventurers, Planters and Gov-

 ernours from the beginnings An: 1584 to the present 1624. In this work Smith

 recapitulated and revised the information set out in his earlier works

 and The Proceedings. For example, he corrected the error included in both

 True Relation and The Proceedings regarding the homeland of the Atquan-
 ahucke which he had incorrectly located in the hinterland as a result of

 his having misinterpreted Powhatan's relation in 1607. Although there

 is nothing particularly revealing regarding the Massawomeck in Smith's

 General Historie, some texts have been expanded to elaborate on earlier

 descriptions which are germane to this work.

 Few of the published administrative, private and diplomatic docu-

 ments associated with the Jamestown colony refer to the Massawomeck.

 The known exceptions are the sometimes erroneous instructions pro-

 vided for Sir Thomas Gates upon his being appointed governor of the

 colony in 1609, and the relation by Henry Spelman following his rescue

 by Samuel Argall in September 1610 after he had been held captive by

 the Powhatan and Potomac over the period 1609-1610.

 Samuel Purchas published the first edition of Purchas - his Pilgrimage

 in 1613. It included a few extracts from Smith's True Relation, published

 2 William Strachey left England for Jamestown in the spring of 1609 with Sir Thomas

 Gates who had recently been appointed governor of the colony. Because their ship was
 wrecked on Bermuda in May 1609, Strachey did nor arrive in Jamestown until May 1610.
 After nearly sixteen months in the colony, during which time he served as secretary to
 the Jamestown Council, Strachey returned to England in 1612 with his manuscript The
 Historie of Travell into Virginia Britania. Unfortunately he arrived at the time when Smith's
 Map of Virginia and The Proceedings were ready to go to press. This conflict, in part, pre-
 vented Strachey's manuscript from being published then. It did not appear for 237 years,
 until 1849, when a manuscript copy of The Historie which Strachey had presented to Francis
 Bacon was published by the Hakluyt Society with R.H. Major as editor. In 1953 another
 copy of Strachey's manuscript, which Strachey had presented to Henry Percy, Earl of
 Northumberland, was published by the Hakluyt Society with Louis B. Wright and Virginia
 Freund as editors. The latter work has been followed here.

 in 1608, and his Map of Virginia (1612). Purchas published the second

 edition of Pilgrimage in 1614 with subsequent reprintings in 1617 and

 1626. Between 1617 and 1621 Purchas commenced work on his enormous

 work Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas - his Pilgrims which appeared in

 1625. In this work Purchas included the entire text of Smith's Map of

 Virginia with a few minor changes. In 1624, Smith had published his

 General Historie of Virginia in which he included a reprint of his Map of

 Virginia as Book 2 and a rewrite of The Proceedings appeared as Book 3.

 Barbour in his recent work The Complete Works of Captain John Smith (1986

 (1): 126) provides a detailed comparison of the overlapping information

 in the various Smith and Purchas texts.

 However, it is Henry Fleet's Journal3 of events on the Potomac over

 the period 1627-1632 which provides the most detailed information re-

 garding the Massomack or Massawomeck. During this period Henry

 Fleet and his brother Edward traded furs with the Massawomeck, visited
 their homeland, and heard accounts of their exploits from the Potomac

 River Algonquians, however exaggerated they might be. While there

 may be some confusion regarding the name of the ship from which Fleet

 traded, there can be no doubt about the value of his Journal as an eye-

 witness account of Massawomeck activity on the Potomac River ca. 1632.

 For the past two hundred years numerous scholars, popular authors,

 and local historians have mined this literature to produce numerous

 books, pamphlets, and papers regarding colonial Virginia and the James-

 town settlers. Seldom do the Massawomeck receive more than passing

 mention in these works.

 3Fleet's manuscript, A Brief Journal of a Voyage in the Bark Virginia, to Virginia and other
 parts of the Continent of America, remained unpublished in the library of the Archbishop of
 Canterbury at Lambeth Palace until 1876. At that time it appeared in Edward Neill's work
 The Founders of Maryland as Portrayed in Manuscripts, Provincial Records and Early Documents
 (Neill 1876). Apart from Hoffman's work Observations on Certain Ancient Tribes (1964), this
 reference has not been used in connection with Massomack/Massawomeck research, al-

 though to this day, it remains the one of only two eyewitness accounts extant and in
 many respects provides the most detailed accounts of these people when they were located

 in the Appalachian hinterland.

 II. PRIMARY ACCOUNTS, CONTEMPORARY

 LITERATURE, AND EARLY CARTOGRAPHY

 MASSAWOMECK FIRST MENTIONED-DECEMBER 1607

 John Smith first learned of the Massawomeck during the seven week

 period from December 1607 to January 1608 (Barbour 1986 (1): 9)

 when he was held captive by Powhatan. In his True Relation pub-

 ished in 1608 (Barbour 1969: 165-234), Smith relates how while held on

 the Pamunkey River by Opechancanough he met Wahunsenacawh, the prin-

 cipal chief of the Powhatan who was later known to the English as

 Powhatan (Wright and Freund 1953: 35 n. 1; Barbour 1969: 368, 472). At

 this time Powhatan related to Smith how, upon a sea beyond the hin-

 terland Quirank mountains (Barbour 1969: 598), there dwelt " . . . a

 mightie nation called Pocoughtronack [Massawomeck], a fierce nation that

 did eate men and warred with the Moyaoncer [Piscataway] and Patarom-
 erke [Potomac]" (ibid.: 186), both of which were located on the tidal
 reaches of the Potomac River. These Massawomeck made war

 " . .. upon all the world [so] that both coastal and foothill tribes regard
 them as mortal foes . . . " (Barbour 1986(2): 176; Schaeffer 1942: vi).

 Undeterred by the fact that at the time he was being held prisoner by

 Powhatan, Smith assured Powhatan that " . . . when he [Smith] should
 find it convenient, wee should deliver under his sujection [Powhatan's]
 The Country of Manacam [sic] 1 and Pocoughtraonack [sic] his enemies"
 (Barbour 1969: 192).

 THE ZUNIGA MAP-CIRCA 1608 (Fig. 2)

 As a result of having heard Powhatan's account of the Massawomeck
 in 1607, Smith included the following notation on the Pedro de Zunliga

 map2 on a hinterland body of water shown to be west of the Chesapeake

 1 The Monacan were eastern Siouians who in 1607 were located near the first falls on

 the James River, present day Richmond, Virginia (Swanton 1946: 152, 218).

 2 The "Zuniga Map" should not be confused with Robert Tindall's 1607 map which is

 no longer extant nor with the 1608 copy of Tindall's map, known as the Draughte of Virginia,
 which is in the British Museum (Quinn 1979 (5): fig. 136; Cumming 1982: 279). Brown
 (1890 (1): 150), whose work has been criticized sharply by Barbour (1986), has suggested
 that Tindall's Draughte of Virginia was copied by Smith when he compiled his Map of
 Virginia. This opinion is shared by others (Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
 1925 Vol. 58; Mook 1943: 32). Recent scholars have suggested that the Zuniga manuscript

 a copy of this same map to Henry Hudson. In any event, prior to September 1608 a copy
 of one of these maps was sent to the Spanish court by Don Pedro de Ziuniga, then the
 first Spanish ambassador to London after the defeat of the Armada in 1588. Later he was
 honored for his work with the title Marques de Villa Flores and Avila.

 8 THE MASSAWOMECK

 Bay at the headwaters of the Rappahannock River: "pocoughtawonauck

 / A Salvage people Dwelling / upon this seay beyond this mayne that

 eate men & women" (Barbour 1969: 238-40; McCary and Barka 1977:

 14; Quinn 1979 (5): 488, fig. 13).

 Robert Tindall's 1608 map Draught of Virginia (Mook 1943(b); Wright

 and Freund 1953: 31) which resembles the Zunfiiga map does not extend
 into the hinterland sufficiently to depict the region in which the ZuiThga

 map locates the Pocoughtawonauck.

 FIRST INDICATIONS ON CHESAPEAKE BAY-JUNE 1608

 Jamestown colonists Walter Russell and Anas Todkill recount in The

 Proceedings (Barbour 1969: 399-405; Quinn 1979 (5): 319-21) how Smith

 set out on 2 June 1608 with a party of twelve colonists, including Russell

 and Todkill, to explore Chesapeake Bay in a barge. Crossing directly to

 Cape Charles on the east shore at the foot of the Bay, Smith made his

 way northward along the shore. In Tangier Sound, generally on the axis

 of the Kaskarawaocke (Nanticoke) River, Smith encountered the Kas-

 karawaocke, Nause, Arsek and Nautaquake. Algonquian bands who

 " . . . much extolled a great nation called Massawomeckes, in search of

 whom we returned [southward] by Limbo ...."3 In his General Historie

 of 1624 Smith remarks that these bands on the eastern shore south of

 Tangier Sound were ". . . the best merchants of all other savages"

 (Lankford 1967: 61).

 Having sustained injuries among his crew and had his boat damaged

 in a storm, Smith returned to the west side of Chesapeake Bay. When

 he reached Kecoughtan, the Powhatan village on Point Comfort at the

 mouth of the James River, Smith explained to the Indians that the in-

 juries to the crew were the result of an encounter with the Massawo-

 meck. News of this supposed engagement " . . . went faster up the

 [James] river than our barge . . . " as the Powhatan bands rejoiced at

 their having been joined by the English in their war against their mortal

 enemy, the Massawomeck (Barbour 1969: 405).

 FIRST ENCOUNTER-JULY 1608

 Nathaniel Po(w)ell and Anas Todkill, both Jamestown settlers who

 accompanied Smith on his second reconnaissance of the Bay, relate in

 The Proceedings how on 20 July Smith further ingratiated himself with

 the Powhatan by reporting to him that on his second reconnaissance

 3Smith's "Limbo" and the "Straits of Limbo" were among the islands at the entrance
 to Tangier Sound, probably between Bloodsworth and Smith islands (Barbour 1969: 401).
 Earlier Stith (1747: 63) had located "Limbo" adjacent to Watts Island.

 " ... he went purposely to be revenged by the Massawomeck ..
 Two days later, having explored the Bolus (Patapsco) River upstream

 six or seven miles from its mouth, Smith set out to cross to the east
 shore of the Chesapeake Bay. There, east of present day Baltimore,
 while crossing to the east side of the Bay, Smith met seven or eight

 canoes of Massawomeck (Barbour 1969: 406; 1986 (2): 105, 109; Quinn

 1979 (5): 322).

 The Massawomeck prepared to attack Smith, but by resorting to the
 ruse of placing many hats on sticks to give the impression of greater
 strength, Smith caused them to withdraw. He followed them to the
 shore anchoring his barge closeby, and eventually succeeded in enticing
 two unarmed Massawomeck to approach his barge in a canoe. When
 Smith presented each of them with a metal bell, the remainder of the
 Massawomeck came aboard his barge readily. They gave Smith meat,
 fish, bear-skins, bows and arrows, clubs, and shields, undoubtedly in
 return for European goods although that is not stated in The Proceedings.
 The remark by Poell and Todkill that the English " . . . understood them
 nothing at all but by signs" (Barbour 1969: 407; Quinn 1979(5): 322) is
 confirmed by Smith in his General Historie (1624: 24); " . . . we had a
 conference by signs, for we understood one another scarcely." When
 trading concluded at dusk, Smith fully expected the Massawomeck to
 return and continue the exchange the next day, but in the morning they

 were gone.

 Both Smith's Map of Virginia (Barbour 1969: 361) and his General Historie
 (1624: 33) were particular to observe the Massawomeck's " . . . desterite
 [sic] in their small boats made of the barkes of trees sowed with barke
 and well luted with gumme, [which] argueth that they are seated upon
 some great water."4

 THE TOCKWOGH ACCOUNT-JULY 1608

 Having lost contact with the Massawomeck, Smith continued his re-

 connaissance of Chesapeake Bay, calling next on the Tockwogh Nan-
 ticoke Algonquian village at the head of the Bay which had within the
 past few days been raided by the Massawomeck he had just met. This
 village, which was in some manner not yet clear, associated with the
 Delaware or Lenape nearby to the north (Brinton 1884: 139), is believed
 to have been located on the Sassafras River near present day George-
 town, Maryland (Barbour 1964: 216; Feest 1978(a): 241). The Proceedings

 4 Having been written before his second reconnaissance of Chesapeake Bay, Smith's
 True Relation of 1608 makes no mention of this only encounter with the Massawomeck.
 Smith's account of this event in his 1612 Map of Virginia is very brief (Barbour 1969: 361)
 so the one by Powell and Todkill in The Proceedings is the most complete account of this
 incident (Barbour 1969: 407). The Powell and Todkill account is the basis for Smith's in
 his General Historie (1624: 33).

 10 THE MASSAWOMECK

 account by Poell and Todkill, both of whom were present, relates how
 when they first encountered the Tockwoghs they were well received,
 but upon seeing the Massawomeck material Smith had acquired, the
 Tockwogh became agitated. Once again Smith retold the tale of his hav-
 ing met and attacked the Massawomeck. Overjoyed by the news that
 the English had engaged their mortal enemy, the Tockwogh took Smith
 and his party to their village where they were entertained grandly. Smith
 learned that the "Many hatchets, knives and pieces of yron and brass"

 he saw in the Tockwogh village had been obtained from the Susquesa-
 hanockes (Susquehannock) a mighty people who too were mortal enemies

 of the Massawomeck. Upon learning that the Susquehannock were but
 two days beyond where his barge could ascend the Susquehanna River
 nearby, Smith prevailed upon the Tockwogh to take him to the mouth
 of the Susquehanna River. There he dispatched a Tockwogh party to

 bring the Susquehannock to meet him (Barbour 1969: 407; Quinn 1979
 (5): 322). Kent (1984: 18,21) places the Washington Boro archaeological
 site in Lancaster County on the lower Susquehanna River in the time

 period ca. 1600-1625, making it contemporaneous with Smith's first en-

 counter with the Susquehannock.

 SUSQUE(SA)HANNOCK ACCOUNTS-JULY 1608

 Sixty Susquehannock warriors responded to Smith's invitation, bring-
 ing him gifts which included venison, smoking pipes, baskets, shields,
 and bows and arrows. When weather prevented the whole Susquehan-
 nock party from returning to the Tockwogh village in their canoes, five
 Susquehannock chiefs readily came aboard Smith's boat and returned
 with him to the Tockwogh village, leaving the remainder of the Sus-

 quehannock party behind at the mouth of the Susquehanna River.

 Poell and Todkill provide an eyewitness account of events in the Tock-
 wogh village. The Susquehannock presented Smith with many gifts in-
 cluding skin clothing and chains of heavy marine shell beads. They
 stroked his body ceremonially in the traditionally Iroquoian greeting

 ritual all the while recounting to him tales of their enmity with the

 Massawomeck. They pledged him their assistance and allegiance and

 promised him gifts if he would " . . . stay with them to defend and

 revenge them to the Massawomecks." The English heard " . . . many

 descriptions and discourses they made us of Atquanahucke, Massawo-
 mecke, and other people, signifying they inhabit the river of Cannida
 [the St. Lawrence], and from the French to have their hatchets, and such
 tooles by trade . . ." (Barbour 1969: 408; Quinn 1979 (5): 323).

 Here too Smith learned that the Susquehannock " . . knowe no more

 of the territories of Powhatan then [sic] his name, and he as little of
 them" (ibid.). In his account in Map of Virginia Smith simply states
 "These are scarce known to Powhatan" (Barbour 1969: 343). It is note-

 worthy that later in his General Historie (1624: 61) Smith elaborates, stat-

 ing " . . . and he as little of them, but the Atquanachuks are on the Ocean

 sea." This sets right Smith's error in his Proceedings regarding the hin-

 terland marine location of the Atquanachuk which first arose as a result

 of his misinterpretation of Powhatan's relation in 1607. An examination

 of the Atquanachuk homeland as an indication of where Massawomeck

 territory was located in 1608 is set out at Appendix A.

 In his 1612 Map of Virginia Smith does not mention his meeting with

 the Susquehannock in the Tockwogh village. However he does provide

 the following information: "Beyond the mountaines from which is the

 head of the river Patawomecke [Potomac], the Savages report inhabit
 their most mortall enemies, the Massawomeckes upon a great salt water,

 which by all likelyhood in either some part of Commada [Canada], some
 great lake, or some inlet of some sea that falleth into the South sea.

 These Massawomeckes are a great nation and very populous. For the

 heads of all those rivers, especially the Pattawomekes, the Pawtuxunts.

 The Sasquesahonocks, the Tockwoughes are continually tormented by

 them . . . " Barbour (1969: 361).

 Smith repeats this information in his General Historie (1624: 33). How-

 ever, Smith's Map of Virginia in his General Historie (Cumming et al. 1971:

 281) does not include the hinterland in which the Massawomeck dwelt.

 In September 1608, after Smith had heard the Tockwogh and Sus-

 quehannock accounts of the Massawomeck and before he published his

 Map of Virginia in 1612, Smith explained how Powhatan had corrected

 his (Smith's) misunderstanding of Powhatan's account of the Massawo-

 meck homeland in 1607: "But for any salt water beyond the mountaines,

 the relations you have had from my people are false . . . " (Barbour

 1969: 414; Quinn 1979 (5): 325). As a result it is surprising to find Smith

 stating erroneously again in 1612, in his Map of Virginia, that the Mas-

 sawomeck lived " . . . upon a great salt water" (Barbour 1969: 361).

 In the Virginia map which accompanies his work Map of Virginia, (Fig.

 1) Smith shows the Massawomeck twice, once as Massawomecks and once

 as Massawomeck, presumably to differentiate between the tribe and its

 chief. He locates them on a large body of water in the hinterland beyond

 the headwaters of a tributary of the Potomac River, which appears to

 be a much enlarged and distorted representation of the Monocacy River,

 where his symbols for three "Kings houses" are shown.

 Poell and Todkill recount how when Smith left the Susquehannock

 and Tockwogh at the head of Chesapeake Bay, he promised he would

 return the next summer to make war on their now common enemy.

 Later while making his way southward along the west shore of Ches-

 apeake Bay, Smith met the Pawtuxunt (Patuxent) and Patawomecks (Po-

 tomac). These too he promised he would return the next summer to

 "revenge them of the Massawomeck." Smith explains in his General

 Historie (1624: 61) how at this time: "The highest mountains we saw

 Northward were called Peregrines mount, and a rocky river where the

 MANAHOAC ACCOUNT-AUGUST 1608

 In his General Historie Smith (1624: 61-63) recounts how having left

 the Susquehannock and Tockwogh, he journeyed southward along the

 west shore of the Bay. In August 1608 he ascended the Rappahannock

 River to the first falls where a skirmish with the Manahoac took place.

 A Manahoac prisoner was questioned regarding the regions beyond the

 hinterland mountains generally, and the Massawomeck in particular.6

 When asked of the nations he knew, the prisoner mentioned the Pow-

 hatan and the Monacans and " . . . the Massawomeckes that were

 higher up in the mountain" than either of these tribes. When asked

 what was beyond the mountains, he replied capriciously, "the sun."

 He went on to explain that "The Massawomeckes did dwell upon a

 great water and had many boats and so many men that they made war

 with all the world."

 INSTRUCTIONS TO SIR THOMAS GATES-1609

 Sir Thomas Gates was appointed governor of Jamestown in the spring

 of 1609 but, having been shipwrecked in Bermuda, he was unable to

 take up his duties until May 1610. Although portions of his instructions

 regarding the conduct of his new duties (Barbour 1969: 262-8) are no-

 torious for their "pompous mistakenness," the information they provide

 regarding the Massawomeck is pertinent. They explain that the "Mas-

 sawomeckes make continual incursions uppon him [Powhatan] and

 uppon all those that inhabit the Rivers of Bolus and Mayomps7 [the

 Patapsco and Potomac rivers] and to the northwest. Cocoughtuwonough
 [sic] infecteth him with Terrible warre . . . " (Bushnell 1907: 35).

 HENRY SPELMAN'S RELATION-1609-1610

 Henry Spelman, an English youth who had been held prisoner by

 Powhatan over the period 1609-1610, relates in his Relation of Virginea

 (Arber 1884: cxiv; Wright and Freund 1953: 46, 101; Hoffman 1964: 199;

 5 Wright and Freund (1953: 47) suggest that Smith's River of Bolus is the Gunpowder
 River while Barbour (1964: 204; 1969: 506) and Lankford (1967: 61) favor the Patapsco
 River. The Ralph Hall Map of Virginia of 1636 (Cumming et al. 1971: 283) indicates that it
 was the James River which was known as Willowbyes Flu.

 6 Thomson (1904: 503) and Bushnell (1935: 4) provide a full account of this incident.

 7 The river of the "Mayomps" refers to the Potomac River where the Piscataway village

 Moyumpse was located (vide Feest 1978: 250 for this Piscataway synonymy).

 try of the Potomeck the people of Masomeck weare brought tether in
 Canoes ... in the forme of an Hoggs trought But sumwhat more hol-
 lowed in." Spelman goes on to describe how they conducted the battle

 with no great slaughter on either side before " . . . ye massomeckes
 having shott away most of their arrows and wantinge Vitall [food] weare

 glad to retier."

 WILLIAM STRACHEY'S HISTORIE-1612

 Strachey's Historie closely parallels accounts of the Massawomeck pro-
 vided by Smith and the authors of The Proceedings. However, Strachey
 alters the Pocoughtronack mentioned by Powhatan to Smith in 1607 to
 read Bocootawwonaukes (Wright and Freund 1953:35, 132) and later to
 Bocootawwonoukes (ibid.: 36). His account of the Massawomeck canoes
 which were " . . . made of the Barkes of trees [probably elm] sowed
 togither and well luted with gum and rosyn of the Pine-tree argueth
 that they are seated upon some great water" (ibid.: 108) differs only
 slightly from Smith's account in his Map of Virginia (Barbour 1969: 361)

 and his General Historie (1624: 33).

 Strachey's account of events in the Tockwogh village when Smith
 socialized with the Susquehannock and Tockwogh, which he did not
 witness, closely follows The Proceedings (Barbour 1969: 407-409; Quinn
 1979 (5): 322-3). Although the following passage from Strachey's Historie
 is reminiscent of Smith's earlier accounts in his Map of Virginia (Barbour
 1969: 361) and his General Historie (1624: 33) it does contain new infor-
 mation: "Beyond the Mountaines, from whence is the head of the River
 Pattawomeck [Potomac], do inhabit the Massawomecks (Powhatan's yet
 mortall Enemyes) upon a great salt that by all likelyhood may either be
 some part of Caneda, some great lake, or some Inlet of some Sea, that
 may fall into the West Ocean [Pacific], or Mar del zur8 these Massa-
 womecks are a great nation and very populous..." (Wright and
 Freund 1953: 107).

 Strachey is paraphrasing the information set out by Smith in his Map
 of Virginia (Barbour 1969: 361) when he explains that: " . . . the Inhab-
 itants of the heads of all those Rivers [on the west shore of Chesapeake
 Bay] expecially the Pattawomeckes the Pawtuxunts the Sasquesahan-
 oughs the Tockwoghs are continually harrowed and frightened of them
 [the Massawomeck] . . . " (Wright and Freund 1953: 107).9 Strachey also

 ' The "Mar del zur" is a sixteenth-century concept of a sea leading to Cathay which
 was associated with Sebastian Cabot's alleged voyage to the New World 1508-1509. (Quinn
 1979 (1): 127).

 9 In his Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas-his-Pilgrims Purchas quotes extensively from
 Smith's works (Barbour 1969: 324-25) but in this instance (1625 (18): 445) he follows Strach-
 ey's text.

 repeats Smith's information that the region thirty leagues northward

 from the Patuxent River to the Susquehanna River, which includes the

 Bolus, or Patapsco, River region was uninhabited (Wright and Freund

 1953: 47).

 CAPTAIN HENRY FLEET, FUR TRADER-1622-1634

 After the cluster of events described by the Jamestown settlers over

 the period 1607-1610, the Massawomeck are not mentioned again until

 Henry Fleet recounts in his Journal how he met them as fur traders on
 the Potomac River in 1632.10

 10 This is not the earliest evidence of English trading on the Potomac River. In 1613

 Argall led a party of Jamestown settlers to the Potomac where, together with other busi-
 ness, he traded corn with the "non-beaver" Potowomeck (Brown 1890 (2): 641). This ex-
 pedition is probably better known for having located bison in this region. In 1622 the
 settlers were on the Potomac again (Waterhouse 1622: 8-9). In 1623 Spelman led a James-
 town party to trade at tidewater on the Potomac. Henry Fleet, the twenty-four year old
 son of William Fleet who was a member of the Virginia Company of London, took part
 in this expedition. When they were attacked by the Anacostank, Spelman was killed and
 Fleet was taken prisoner (Scarf 1879: 14). Having incorrectly identified the Conoy Algon-
 quian "Nacotchtank" band (Feest 1978: 250) as an Iroquoian group located on the Potomac
 some fifteen miles upstream from the Piscataway Conoy band, Merill (1979: 552) has er-
 roneously placed Fleet in contact with Iroquoians at this time.

 Upon his release by the Anacostank, Fleet returned to England where he joined William
 Clobery, a London merchant prepared to invest in the Virginia trade. In September 1627
 Fleet returned to Virginia as master of the 100-ton Paramour hired by Clobery to trade for
 furs on Chesapeake Bay. This signaled the beginning of a regular and organized trade in
 furs on Chesapeake Bay. That year a shipload of furs was sent to Holland. It is also
 recorded that year that Robert Poole, a Jamestown settler, spent several weeks with the
 Patuxent trading blue glass beads which had been manufactured at Jamestown. Fleet's
 activities from 1627 to 1632 are not known in detail but it is clear that from 1627 to 1640
 he was active in the Chesapeake fur trade. His account of trading with the Massawomeck
 at Great Falls on the Potomac in 1632 is the most detailed on these people and their
 homeland.

 Over the period 1630-1631 William Clairbourne, an associate of Fleet's, established a fur
 trading post on Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay east of present day Annapolis, Maryland,
 and later a smaller post on Palmers Island in the mouth of the Susquehanna River. These
 posts were intended to provide access to the Patuxent on the western shore of the Bay,
 who were said to be the best beaver trappers, and the beaver-rich Susquehannock who,
 as early as 1626, had been trading with the Dutch at New Amsterdam. Powhatans had
 been excluded from the trade after the rebellion of 1622. Fausz (1985, App. B: III) suggests
 these posts were also intended to discourage Iroquois interference from the north. The
 Massawomeck, in the Cumberland Gap region at this time, would not have been affected.
 In 1633 so much cloth was diverted from the Virginia settlers to the fur trade, and so
 many skins were leaving the colony, much to the detriment of the colonists, that an act
 was passed to regulate the trade and protect the settlers interests.

 Before Claibourne and his fellow Virginians could fully reap the lucrative returns an-
 ticipated from the posts on Kent and Palmers islands, the Marylanders, led by Leonard
 Calvert, arrived at the mouth of the Potomac River in March 1634 with Henry Fleet as
 their guide. Fleet and Calvert visited the Potowomeck on the Potomac to negotiate land
 for the settlers (Menard and Carr 1982: 171). Calvert has explained how in March 1634 the
 Marylanders had arrived too late to participate in the fur trade with the Massawomeck
 that year. Significantly Calvert also remarked how over the period 1629-1632 the Massa-
 womeck had directed large quantities of furs to Kirke and the English at Quebec.

 PRIMARY ACCOUNTS 15

 In May 1632, after being held captive by the Anacostank at the Great

 Falls on the Potomac River over the period 1623-1627 (Morrison 1921:

 222), Fleet returned to the Potomac River to trade for beaver pelts. Upon

 entering the river he sent his brother Edward ahead to trade with the

 Piscattoway (Piscataway) who lived on the Piscataway River three days

 up the Potomac River. Henry planned to trade with the Potomack lower

 on the Potomac but finding few furs in that region, he moved farther

 up the river to a location near present day Washington D.C. to trade

 with the Nacostines (Anacostank) (Feest 1978: 250), his erstwhile captors.

 Relations between the Anacostank and the Piscataway were strained.

 Shortly before Fleet arrived the Massawomeck had killed some 1000

 Piscataway to establish the Anacostank as the Massawomeck-approved

 middlemen who were " . . . to convey all such English truck [trade

 goods] as commeth into the river to the Massomacks . . . [and as a result

 the Anacostank were] protected by the Massomacks or Cannyda Indians"

 (Neill 1876: 25; Feest 1978: 243). Although the Piscataway were still a

 potent force and more numerous, they were reluctant to interfere overtly

 in these Anacostank middleman activities.

 Fleet fortuitously encountered Daniel Gookin (1792), an English in-

 terpreter, who may have visited the Massawomeck homeland, and sev-

 eral Algonquians who had recently been there. From them he learned

 that the Massawomeck were a populous nation governed by four

 "kings" who lived in villages named Tohoga, Mosticum, Shaunnetowa, and

 Usserahak. As a result Fleet estimated they greatly outnumbered the 5000

 tidewater Algonquians whom Smith believed to be living in the Potomac
 River region at that time.1" Upon learning that the Massawomeck had

 accumulated a large stock of beaver skins for trade, Henry brushed aside

 Anacostank and Piscataway attempts to prevent him from dealing di-

 rectly with the Massawomeck. On 14 June he sent Edward to bring the

 Massawomeck to trade with him at the Great Falls on the Potomac River.

 Eleven days later, on 25 June, Henry set out to meet Edward on his

 return journey from Tonhoga (Tohoga?). Upon reaching the Great Falls

 Henry remarked that the country above the falls was " . . . rocky and

 mountainous like Cannida." While it is likely that Fleet was familiar

 with the Potomac region, there is no reason to believe that he had been

 to the region on the St. Lawrence River known to the French as

 "Canada," or to the "Cannyda" region.

 On 3 July Edward appeared at Great Falls with two Massawomeck.

 By 1638 the Marylanders had eclipsed the Virginians in the fur trade on Chesapeake
 Bay. Nevertheless the loyalty of the post on Kent Island remained in doubt for some time.
 Although the fur trade on Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River continued on into the
 1650s (Morrison 1921; Menard and Carr 1982: 190; Fausz 1985), there is no mention of the
 Massawomeck after Calvert's remarks in May 1634.

 " In his 1612 Map of Virginia Smith estimated that within sixty miles of Jamestown there

 were some 5,000 Indians who were subject to Powhatan (Barbour 1969: 354).

 16 THE MASSAWOMECK

 He recounted to Henry how from the Great Falls he had spent seven

 days traveling to the Massawomeck homeland and five days on the
 return voyage. He also related how there he had visited thirty palisaded

 Massawomeck villages, one of which contained three hundred houses

 and how when he delivered four presents to the king of this village,

 the king had " . . . dispersed them to the rest" of the people, an act

 reminiscent of Iroquoian gift-giving which did not prevail among the

 tidewater Algonquians. Edward explained how 110 Massawomeck with

 "40,000 weight" of furs were on their way to trade at Great Falls. The

 two Massawomeck who had returned with Edward had been selected

 by the "nation" to confirm Fleet's ability to provide the European trade

 goods they would demand before they entered into a direct trading

 arrangement with him which would bypass their Anacostank middle-

 men. The Anacostank, fearful of losing their preferred status as mid-

 dlemen, regaled these Massawomeck scouts with tales alleging that Fleet

 meant to destroy them and steal their furs in retaliation for the recent

 Massawomeck attack on the Piscataway. When Fleet confronted the An-

 acostank with their treachery, they offered to ally themselves with him

 and promised, if he would give their king a present, that they would

 bring the Massawomeck to him for trade.

 There matters stood until 10 July when six Massawomeck from Us-

 serahak, by their account a town of 7000, arrived ready to trade directly

 with Fleet. They drew a map of their country for Fleet and explained

 they had brought sixty canoes of furs, but these too had been intercepted

 by the Anacostank who still hoped to prevent the Massawomeck from

 trading directly with Fleet. "These [Usserahak Massawomeck] promised

 if I would show them my truck [they would] get a great store of canoes

 to come down with one thousand Indians that should trade with

 me . . . ." Fleet noted that the Usserahak " . . . delight in hatchets, and

 knives of large size, broad cloth, and coats, shirts and Scottish stockings.

 The women desire bells and some kind of beads" (Neill 1876: 30).

 The following day " . . . there came from another place [not from the

 Massawomeck homeland] seven lusty men with strange attire; they had

 red fringe .... Their language was haughty and they seemed to ask

 me what I did there, and demanded to see my truck, which upon view,

 they scorned. They had two axes such as Captain Kirk traded in Can-

 nida . . . ." They went aboard Fleet's vessel and drew for him a map

 of their country which did not differ greatly from that which the Us-

 serahak Massawomeck had drawn for him earlier. Significantly Fleet

 states, "These [Indians] called themselves Mosticums [a Massawomeck

 'nation'] but afterwards I found [from the Usserahak] they were of a

 people [who lived] three days journey from these [the Massawomeck

 of Mosticum] and were [in fact] called Hereckeenes who with their own

 beaver, and that which they get from those that do ajoin upon them do

 drive a trade in Cannida, at the plantation [settlement], which is fifteen
 days journey from this place"; presumably that was the distance of the
 "plantation" from the Hereckeenes homeland.

 On 14 July one of Fleet's men, William Elderton, joined the Hereck-
 eenes who pretended to be Mosticum Massawomecks to visit their
 homeland. The next day when the Usserahak Massawomeck learned
 what Elderton had done, they were agitated fearing that " . . . these
 people were not their friends, but that they were Hereckeenes," who
 would eat Elderton. When the Usserahak Massawomeck had finished
 trading with Fleet, they demonstrated their satisfaction with the direct
 trading arrangement telling Fleet that two hundred Massawomeck
 would soon come to Great Falls to trade beaver pelts with him.

 On 18 July Fleet visited the Piscataways down river to excuse himself
 . . . for trading with those that were [their] enemies . . . ," the Mas-
 sawomecks. On 7 August, the Massawomeck from Tonhoga, the To-
 hogoes, arrived at Great Falls to trade saying they had come because
 " . . . they had received assurance to our [Fleet's] love of the Ussera-
 haks, although the Nacostines [the Anacostank middlemen] had [still]
 much laboured the contrary." While trading was in progress the To-
 hogoes became alarmed when they learned that one of Fleet's men (Eld-
 erton?) had been " . . . slain by the Hireckeenes (sic) three days journey
 beyond them, and that they [the Hereckeenes] had beguiled us [Fleet]
 with the name Mostikums, one of their [Massawomeck] confederation
 nations. Nevertheless, they being desirous to have some trial [experi-
 ence] of us, had sent us these skins . . . [and if Fleet's trading arrange-
 ments were satisfactory] they would come [from] all four nations [Ton-
 hoga, Mosticum, Shaunetowa and Usserahak] and trade with. . . "Fleet

 (Neill 1876: 33).

 When Fleet's trade goods were depleted he moved from Great Falls
 to Moyumpse, a Piscataway village farther down the Potomac River. He
 was followed into Piscataway territory, apparently with impunity and
 without fear of their recent enemies, by " . . . three cannibals of Usser-
 ahak, Tohoga, and Mosticum ... [who said] they would come with a great
 number of people that should trade with us as formerly they had
 spoken . . . ." The magnitude of the fur trade of which Fleet was a part
 can be appreciated from the report that in 1632 some 2,700 pounds of
 fur worth 120 pounds sterling were collected by the Chesapeake Bay

 fur traders (Fausz 1985: 5).

 Fleet returned to Jamestown where in September 1632 he was tried
 for having violated fur trade regulations. When he was cleared of these
 charges, he built a new barque of sixteen tons which he sent " . . . to
 the Cannadies [Massawomeck] with provisions and such merchan-
 dize . . . " (Neille 1876: 36). Unfortunately nothing more is known of

 this expedition.

 18 THE MASSAWOMECK

 CALVERT'S LETTER-1634

 On 30 May 1634, Leonard Calvert, governor of the newly established

 Maryland colony at St. Mary's at the mouth of the Potomac River, wrote

 to Sir Richard Lechford his partner in England in the Maryland venture,

 reporting in part on the Marylander's participation in the Massawo-

 mecke fur trade (10): "Whilst we were a-doing these things [establishing

 St. Mary's City] our pinnace by our director followed the trade of beaver

 through all parts of the precincts of this province. But by reason of our

 late arrivall here [March 1634] we came too late for the first part of the

 trade this year; which is the reason I have sent hom so few furrs - (they

 being dealt for by those Virginians [Fleet and Claibourne?] before our

 crossing) - the second part of our trade is now in hand, and is like to

 prove very beneficiall. The nation we trade withal at this time a-year is

 called the Massawomeckes. This nation cometh seven eight and ten days

 journey to us - these are those from who Kircke had formerly all his

 trade of beaver. We have lost by our late comming 3000 skins, which

 other Virginians have traded for, but hereafter they shall come no more

 here, wherefore I make no doubt but next year we shall drive a very

 great trade if our supply of truck fail not" (Maryland Historical Society

 Fund Publication No. 35, 1899: 25-26; Morrison 1921: 224; Hoffman 1964:

 200; Menard and Carr 1982: n25).

 Calvert's account suggests that Fleet was still trading with the Mas-

 sawomecks in 1634 and, presumably, he had done so in 1633 as well.

 This conclusion accords with what we know of Fleet's plans for his new

 sixteen-ton barque which he had dispatched to trade with the Cannadies

 in the spring of 1633.

 In view of the importance of the Massawomeck fur traders to the

 Maryland settlers, it is surprising to find that they are not located on

 Lord Baltimore's map of 1635 Nova Terrae-Mariae (Cumming et al. 1971:

 262; 1982: 288). Nor are they located on Ralph Smith's Map of Virginia

 of 1636 (ibid.: 283), the other English map of this period.

 Calvert's letter of May 1634 is the last contemporary documentary

 evidence of the Massawomeck. Possibly conflict between Virginians and

 Marylanders had driven them from trading on Chesapeake Bay.

 JOHANNES JANSSON MAP-1636

 Johannes Jansson's map America Septentrionale of 1636 (Goss 1990b:
 72), although largely derivative, is particularly significant in this context
 because it is the first map to place the Massawomeck in the hinterland
 immediately west of Chesapeake Bay. Theretofore Smith's manuscript
 map of 1608, the so-called ZuPniga map (Fig. 2), and his map Virginia of
 1612 (Fig. 1), both place them in a marine or lacustrine location a con-
 siderable distance west of Chesapeake Bay in keeping with the infor-
 mation related by Smith in 1607 and by Powell and Todkill in 1608.

 Jansson's map reflects their presence in a region adjacent to the Bay over

 the period 1632-1634 where they had ready access to Jamestown and

 Maryland fur traders as Henry Fleet and Leonard Calvert have related.
 It is noteworthy that there was sufficient Dutch interest in the English
 fur trade on Chesapeake Bay in 1636 for them to record the presence of
 the Massawomeck who were the principal source of these furs. The
 absence of the Massawomeck from Jansson's map Nova Anglia Novum

 Belgium et Virginia (Goss 1990b: 70), which was also published in 1636,

 may reflect more recent information regarding the Massawomeck which,

 for some reason, would have them cease to be important in this fur
 trade. In this event the disappearance of the Massawomeck may be

 attributed to 1635, possibly 1636. Regrettably neither Blaeu's 1635 map

 Nova Belgica et Anglio Nova (Goss 1990a: 164), which is a copy of Adriaen
 Blockx's manuscript map Carte Figurative ca. 1614, nor his 1638 map

 Viginial partis australis et Floridae partis orientalis (Goss 1990b: 74), quite

 incorporate the region in which Jansson locates the Massawomeck in

 1636.

 DANIEL GOOKIN-ca. 1640

 Daniel Gookin, an Irish contemporary of Fleet's who had been present

 in the Virginia colony from November 1621 to 1643 (Tyler 1901 (4): 170;

 (9): 234-35), did not add much to information in the Proceedings when

 he wrote: "There is a numerous race of Indians that live upon a great

 lake or sea. Some report it to be salt water while other fresh .... This

 people I conceive to be the same that Capt. Smith in his History of Virginia

 [sic] doth in several places call Massawomecks .... Now the place
 where he met with and heard of this great people of Massawomecks

 [sic] was at the head of Chesapeake Bay or Gulf - and he saith they had
 recourse thither from the lakes and seas where they lived, in canoes of

 bark and trees" (Anon; Gookin 1792).

 This suggests that Gookin had not been to the Massawomeck home-

 land, although he had advised Fleet when he arrived on the Potomac
 River in 1632 that they held a large store of furs to trade. Presumably
 Gookin's Algonquian traveling companions were the source of his in-
 formation regarding Massawomeck fur holdings.

 THE ROBERT DUDLEY MAP-1647

 Sir Robert Dudley's derivative map Virginia Vecchio e Nuoua of 1647
 (Fig. 3) also locates the Massawomeck in the hinterland west of Ches-
 apeake Bay. I have not been able to discern whether this information
 was simply copied from Jansson's map of 1636, or derived from Fleet's
 and Calvert's accounts.

 THE JOHN FARRER MAP- 1651

 John Farrer's map The Sea of China and the Indies of 1651 (Fig. 4) is a

 derivative map, which is seldom used as evidence in this context. On
 this map (Cumming et al. 1971: 269) the word "Massawomeckes" ap-

 pears in quite small letters in the mountainous region between the head-
 quarters of the Delaware River and a greatly attenuated eastern tributary
 of the Potomac River. In this location Farrer's "Massawomeckes" are

 close to "A Mighty great Lake" and the "Canada Flu," The St. Lawrence
 River, both of which are shown on the Farrer map to be adjacent to, or

 part of, "Nova Francia." Although Farrer's map is later than Dudley's,

 Farrer appears to be still reflecting Smith's 1608 location of the Massa-

 womeck on the River of Canada at a time when they were living in the

 Chesapeake Bay hinterland as related by Fleet and Calvert over the

 period 1632-1634.

 THE JOHN LEDERER MAP-1672

 Although it is significantly later, the largely derivative Lederer map

 of 1672 (Fig. 5) also places the Massawomeck in a location that accords

 best with Smith's explanation of 1608 rather than the events in the period

 1632-1634. Beyond the mountains at the headwaters of several rivers

 which drain into Chesapeake Bay on the west side, one of which has

 been identified as the James (Hoffman 1964: 205) in a blank area on the

 map there is the legend: "The Massawomecks dwelt/heretofore beyond

 these/Mountains." Lederer makes no mention of the Massawomeck in

 his text (Cumming and Right 1958). Apparently he too was not aware,

 as Dudley was, of the Virginia and Maryland fur trade with the Mas-

 sawomeck.

 THE DELISLE MAP-ca. 1700

 This unpublished sketch map, which was probably compiled between

 1700 and 1703 by Guillaume Delisle in the preparation for the 1703 map

 of America attributed to Father Claude Delisle, is particularly significant.

 In reality it is little more than a compilation of notes reflecting infor-

 mation derived, largely, from the Jesuit Relations. However, in the hills

 to the west of the head of Chesapeake Bay there is the legend: "Mas-

 sawomeckies Savage people who are almost continually at war with the

 Susquehannock and the Tockwogh." Although this is simply a repeti-

 tion of the information Smith revealed in 1608 which placed the Mas-

 sawomeck on the River of Canada, Delisle's location of this legend in

 the hinterland west of Chesapeake Bay fits with the Fleet and Calvert

 accounts for the period 1632-1634. Delisle thereby provides the sole

 French reference to the movement of the Massawomeck from a lacus-

 trine area associated with the River of Canada and the "Canyda region"

 to a place adjacent to, and west of, Chesapeake Bay where they engaged

 in a fur trade with the Virginians and Marylanders. Appearing more

 than sixty years later when the Massawomeck were no longer indicated

 on the maps of the day, Delisle's map reflects the Massawomecks' lo-

 cation indicated by Jansson in 1636 and Dudley in 1647.

 These accounts which describe events in the period from prior to 1608

 to ca. 1634, and the several seventeenth-century maps mentioned, com-

 prise the known inventory of primary and contemporary documentary

 and cartographic sources regarding the Pocoughtronack, Massomack,

 and Massawomeck. Most are closely associated with English settlement

 and trading activities in the tidewater regions of Chesapeake Bay. Some

 are eyewitness accounts, but apart from Smith's brief encounter on
 Chesapeake Bay in 1608 and certain events described in Fleet's Journal
 for the period 1627-1632, much of the information is hearsay repetition

 of sometimes misunderstood relations by the Indians. Nevertheless, it

 does constitute the body of primary and contemporary evidence on

 which to premise our understanding of the Massawomeck.

 III. THE CURRENT SITUATION

 THE MASSAWOMECK HOMELAND

 M t } tany have long sought to identify the Massawomeck homeland.

 Possibly the first to do so was Thomas Jefferson who, being

 keenly interested in the Indians, noted in 1781 that: "West-

 ward of all these tribes1 beyond the mountains and extending to the

 great lakes, were the Massawomecs, a most powerful confederacy who

 harassed unremittingly the Powhatans and the Manahoacs" (Jefferson
 1904: 497; Bozman 1837: 112-4; Thomson 1904; Peden 1955). In the nine-

 teenth century several scholars suggested a location for the Massawo-
 mecks. General John S. Clark prepared a map2 to illustrate Hawley's
 Early Chapters in Cayuga History, published by the Oneida Historical Soci-

 ety in 1879, which included the notation "Massawomecks Near Lake

 Erie. Described by Gov. Smith 1608." That same year Scarf (1879: 88)

 located the Massawomeck homeland on Lake Ontario. In 1892 Beau-

 champ (1892: 98) explained, " . . . there are good reasons for placing

 them [the Massawomeck] even south of the Eries. It is true that either

 the Seneca or the Eries could have gone down the Allegheny and

 reached the Potomac by a short portage."

 Twentieth-century scholars too have sought to locate the Massawo-

 meck homeland. Bushnell (1907: 35) placed the Masawoymeles and the

 Coughtuwonough (sic) to the north and northwest of the Potomac. Bush-

 nell (1930, 1935, 1937) used Smith's 1612 Virginia map (Fig. 1) to locate

 some seventeen to nineteen Algonquian village sites on the Potomac

 River which were known to Smith. McCary and Barka (1977: 85) have

 suggested that by demonstrating Smith's accuracy, Bushnell has en-

 hanced the credibility of his location of the Massawomeck on the "great

 water" in the hinterland. This seems unlikely. Smith was familiar with

 much of the Chesapeake Bay tidewater regions and sometimes beyond,

 but significantly he explains: " . . . as far as you see the little crosses

 [on his 1612 map] on rivers, mountains, and other places have been

 discovered; the rest was had by information of the Savages and are set

 down according to their instructions" (Barbour 1969: 344). The location

 of the Massawomeck indicated on the Virginia map is well beyond the

 1 Jefferson also mentions the Monacans, making them synonymous with the Tuscarora,

 and the Monahoacs.

 2 Winsor includes this map in his Narrative and Critical History of America (1884: 293) to

 illustrate Shea's essay Jesuit, Recollects and the Indians.

 regions explored by Smith, and so cannot be considered as reliable as
 places within the bounds of Smith's explorations as McCary and Barka

 have suggested. However, this alone cannot serve to deny the accuracy

 of the information Smith obtained from the Indians for his Virginia map.
 Hoffman (1964: 200-201) has sought to locate the Massawomeck
 homeland adjacent to Chesapeake Bay by coupling Governor Calvert's

 account of the Massawomeck traveling eight to ten days to trade at the

 Great Falls on the Potomac in 1634 with Edward Fleet's account of his
 seven day journey to Massawomeck homeland in 1632. As a result Hoff-
 man suggests that Massawomeck territory was located on the head-

 waters of the Potomac River, or possibly beyond on the Youghiogheny

 branch of the Monongehela River which rises a scant 10 miles from the

 upper reaches of the Potomac River on the Pennsylvania-West Virginia
 border near the Cumberland Gap.

 Hoffman has also examined closely the Massawomeck connection
 with the Erie (ibid.: 204).3 He notes Ragueneau's explanation in 1648
 that: "This Lake called Erie, was formerly inhabited on its Southern

 shores by certain tribes who we call the Nation of the Cat; they have
 been compelled to retire far inland to escape their enemies who are
 farther to the West" (Thwaites 1895-1901 (33): 63). In particular Hoffman
 notes the French concept of the Erie as reflected by the notation on the

 Bernou map ca. 1680 (Hoffman 1964: 206; White 1978: 408) below Lac

 Teiocha rontiong du communement Lac Erie, which reads: "This Lake is not

 Lake Erie as people usually call it. Erie is a part of Chesapeake Bay

 Virginia, where the Eries have always lived."

 Following a detailed examination of the historic and archaeological

 3 Unfortunately very little is known of the Erie at this time, (White 1978 a). Archaeological

 data suggest that in the period 1535-1640 elements of the Erie occupied the lacustrine
 regions at the east end of Lake Erie and the hinterland along the banks of Cattauraugus
 Creek. Ethnohistory and history indicate that prior to 1644-1645 they were driven deep
 into the hinterland (White 1978a: 415). Gendron (1868: 8) stated in 1644 or 1645 that: "This
 lake called Erie was formerly inhabited on its southern shores by certain people whom
 we call the Nation of the Cat. . . This nation has been obliged to withdraw very far into
 the country to escape from their enemies who are toward the west" (emphasis mine). It
 has been suggested that this move occurred ca. 1638 under pressure from the western
 Iroquois, the Seneca and Cayuga, who had also caused the Wenro to move to Huronia at
 about the same time (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8): 302; (17): 25) Beauchamp (1889 (a): 125)
 believed that the Erie at one time, perhaps within the historic era, included the Seneca.
 The orientation westward in the Gendron text must be a copying error probably caused
 by the similarity between the French for west, ouest, and east, est. An identical incon-
 trovertible error appears in the Jesuit Relation for 1641 where "west" has crept into the
 text when "east" is essential to this account regarding the origin of the marine shell used
 by the Neutral.

 Bernard Hoffman (1964: 234) has examined the extent of Erie territory and postulated
 a territory significantly larger than any heretofore recognized. It includes the headwaters
 of the Potomac and Monongahela rivers. Marion White (1971: 22; 1978: 412) has rejected
 this hypothesis largely on the basis that it encompasses too large an area and because it
 included several major watersheds which, she suggests, was not a normal Iroquoian prac-
 tice.

 literature, Hoffman concludes, in part, that the Massawomeck lived west

 of the Piedmont Siouan tribes, " . . . on the headwaters of the Potomac

 and on the upper Ohio drainage area" (ibid.: 222). On the basis of the

 archaeological data he places them on the south shore of Lake Erie in

 the region attributed to the Whittlesey people and at the headwaters of

 the Mongahela and Youghiogheny rivers in the region attributed to the

 Mongahela.

 Barbour (1964) has suggested, in general terms, that the Massawo-

 meck lived beyond the Nanticoke Algonquians without stating in which

 direction. Merrill (1979: 552) places them initially " . . . on the head-

 waters of the Potomac and upper Ohio rivers" and later they

 " . . . moved into the lower Potomac to settle." This latter location ap-

 pears to be derived from his opinion that the Nacotchtank, Anacostank,

 were Iroquoians. In his definitive work Barbour (1986 (2): 11, n. 2) has

 noted how one edition of Smith's General Historie (1624), The Second

 Book, includes the statement " . . . with the estate and condition of

 eight other several nation adjoyning to them" which is not included in

 all editions. As a result Barbour concludes that the Massawomeck did

 not dwell in an area adjacent to Powhatan.

 At present the Zuifniga map of 1608, Smith's Virginia map of 1612, the

 Jansson map of 1636, the Dudley map of 1647, the Farrer map of 1651,

 the Hondius-Visscher map of 1669, the Lederer map of 1672, and the

 Delisle map of ca. 1700 are the only maps, French or English, which

 locate the Pocoughtronack/Massawomeck/Massomack.

 IDENTIFICATION OF THE MASSAWOMECK

 Many have recorded their opinions regarding the identity of the Mas-

 sawomeck. Most have sought to associate them with one or another of

 the seventeenth-century Iroquoian tribes, frequently with one of the Five

 Nation Iroquois. Thomas Jefferson (1904: 497) explained "These [the

 Massawomeck] were probably the ancestors of tribes known at present

 by the Six Nations." It is noteworthy that Jefferson's criticism of Stith's

 work (1747: 67) History of the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia, in

 which he suggested that the Massawomeck were Seneca Iroquois, was

 directed at the literary value of the work, not at matters of substance.

 Unfortunately the original documents available to Stith had disappeared

 by the time Rutman edited his work in 1969. Charles Thomson com-

 menting on Jefferson's identification noted that the "Indians which lived

 to the north of them [the Manhattan] between the Kittatinney mountains

 or highlands and the Lake Ontario and who call themselves Mingoes

 and are called by the French writers Iroquois, by the English Five Na-

 tions, and the Indians to the southward, with whom they are at war,

 Massawomacs" (Thomson 1904: 503; Bozman 1837: 112-14). He also

 THE CURRENT SITUATION 27

 noted that the "Monacans and their friends better known latterly as the

 Tuscarora, were probably connected with the Massawomecs, or five

 nations" (Thomson 1904: 498). In an appendix to Jefferson's Notes on the

 State of Virginia (1787), Thomson also suggested that the Massawomeck

 were the Five Nation Iroquois (Thomson 1904: Peden 1955; Weslager

 1983: 35).

 Nineteenth-century scholars were particularly diligent in their at-

 tempts to equate the Massawomeck with one of the better-known Indian

 groups. De Witt Clinton (1820: 40, 64) argued that the Massawomeck

 were Iroquois. Gallatin (1836 (2): 421) suggested that the Massawomeck

 encountered by Smith were a group of Iroquois fulfilling their career of

 conquest and, for him, the incident proved that the Iroquois were a

 great power who dominated a large region. Bozman (1837: 112-14) sup-

 ported this identification, but Royce (1881: 179) did not accept this iden-

 tification or this explanation. In 1844 Bancroft (1844 (1): 134) suggested

 they were Mohawks. Scarf (1879: 14) agreed, relating erroneously that

 Fleet had said he went to trade on the Potomac with Mohawk man-

 eaters. Miner (1845: 20) suggested that "some" of the Five Nations had

 " . . . come from the Wyoming valley where they were known as Mas-

 sawomecks." He went on to explain that the Massawomeckes and the

 Massachusett derived their name from association with a hill, which

 in a case of the Massawomeck was a reference to the hills which sur-

 round the Wyoming valley. In his work Notes on the Iroquois Schoolcraft

 (1847: 155) noted how, under the name Massawomeck, the Iroquois dom-

 inated the "Powhattanic Confederacy" in Virginia. Later (1857: 180, 194)

 he repeated this Iroquois identification in his work History of the Indian

 Tribes. Several nineteenth-century scholars have supported Schoolcraft's

 identification (Scarf 1879: 88; Mooney 1894: 12-13; Fowke 1894: 72), and

 it has prevailed in this century (Tyler 1907; 88, n. 1; Cadzow 1936: 13;

 Barbour 1964: 215-16; Mouer 1983: 21).

 Over a long period William Martin Beauchamp expressed several
 opinions regarding Massawomeck identity. In his Origin and Early Life
 of the New York Iroquois, a paper read before the Oneida Historical Society,
 20 March 1886 (Beauchamp 1889 (a): 124), he noted that the "Early writ-
 ers made these [Massawomeck] any part of the Five Nations, but later
 students have identified them, as in the case of the Entouhonorons, with
 both the Erie and the Senecas, these being firm friends until 1653."
 Having mentioned Fleet's fur trading in 1632, Beauchamp (ibid.) con-
 cludes again that " . . . there remains no doubt that this name [Mas-
 sawomeck] included the Erie and Senecas, then or previously allied."
 Beauchamp (1889 (b): 121-25) repeated his conviction that in 1632 when
 they were encountered by Fleet, the Massawomeck were Eries and Sen-
 ecas then, or earlier, allied, but it was as Seneca that " . . . the Mas-
 sawomecks of New York made themselves feared by the Indians of Vir-
 ginia." In 1892, he explained that the Massawomeck were clearly related
 to the Iroquois but were likely Erie which included more than one "na-

 28 THE MASSAWOMECK

 tion" (1892: 98-99). He speculated that Edward Fleet may have reached

 the southern villages of the Erie in 1632 and that the four kings Fleet

 mentions may have been the four nations of the Erie (ibid.: 100-101).

 In 1894 he remarked, "The general description of the Massawomeckes

 points to a nation of this family [Iroquoian] to the south of the Eries,

 whereas they have been identified with the Five Nations without suf-

 ficient reason" (1894: 62). In 1895 he opined that, "It seems proper to

 consider the Massawomeck a southern division of a numerous group"

 which he believed to be elements, at least, or the Seneca and Erie (1895:

 323). In 1898 he suggested that they " . . . were probably a southern

 offshoot of the Erie" (1898: 87) Later he raised the possibility that they

 might be Oneida (1900: 88). Finally in 1905 (1905: 193-94) Beauchamp

 concluded they were the Erie group who once had inhabited Cattar-

 augus and Chautauqua countries.

 Tooker (1894: 185 n. 1) draws upon Strachey's revised spelling of

 Smith's Pocoughtronack, Bocootawwonaukes and later Bocootawwnonoukes

 (Wright and Freund 1953: 35, 132, 136), and the Zuifiga map, to interpret

 Bocootaw as "fire" and anuak as "people" and thereby connect Strachey's

 otherwise unknown Bocootawwonoukes with the Atsistaehronons or "Fire

 Nation" who were enemies of the Huron and Neutral (Thwaites 1895-

 1901 (21): 95; Goddard 1978: 668-72). Strachey compounds the problem

 when he identifies the Pocoughtronack and the Massawomeck as separate

 and discrete neighbors of the Powhatan's (Wright and Freund 1953: 57).

 However, this is the only instance in the primary sources where these

 synonyms occur in a context which makes them separate groups.

 Royce (1881: 182) concluded that the several tribes which occupied

 the south shore of Lake Erie; the Massawomeckes, Erie, and Satanas or

 Chaouanons and the Shawnee; were one and the same people. He ex-

 plains: "The Jesuits never succeeded in establishing contact with the

 Eries. Their intercourse with them was almost nothing and they left us

 no vocabularies by which their linguistic stock can be determined. I

 regard, therefore, the single volunteer remark as to their having the

 same language with the Hurons as having less weight in the scale of

 probabilities than the accumulated evidence of their identity with the

 Massawomeckes and Chaouanons."

 Parkman (1899: 341) and Murray (1908: 44) speculate, without pro-

 viding reasons, that the Massawomeck were Mohawk.

 During the first quarter of this century several scholars published de-

 tailed papers which examined the tidewater Algonquians in the Ches-
 apeake Bay region (Bushnell 1907; 1908; Mooney 1907; Speck 1907; 1924;
 Willoughby 1907). It is surprising that, apart from Bushnell's brief com-
 ment which notes that the Massawomeck made war on Powhatan (1907:

 35), these otherwise definitive works do not mention the Massawomeck.

 Hunt (1904: 23-24) accepted the Massawomeck on Chesapeake Bay

 in 1608 as a small band of marauders, but he noted that, "There is no

 conclusive reason for supposing them to have been Iroquois." Referring
 to Hunt's work, Fenton (1940: 235) supported this conclusion stating

 " . . . there remains little likelihood that Smith's Massawomecke were
 a party of Iroquois marauders." He suggests that they were more prob-
 ably a war party from higher on the Susquehanna River. Schaeffer (1942:
 vii) and Roy Wright (1974: 67) have supported Fenton's conclusion. Fen-
 ton hypothesizes (ibid.) that Champlain's Carantouannais, Brebeuf's Sca-
 hentoarronons "The People of the Big Flats," and Smith's Massawomecke
 were components of a group which occupied the Susquehanna River
 valley between the Susquehannock, below present day Harrisburg, and
 the Mohawk to the north. He suggests these tribes were hostile to both

 the Susquehannock and the Mohawk.

 Hunt (1940: 186 n 2) argues that the Massawomeck who "do drive a

 trade in Cannida" with the French prior to 1608, cannot be Erie because

 Erie survivors did not meet the French until after their confederacy was

 destroyed in 1656 and they were first seen by the French as captives in
 Iroquois villages. Roy Wright (1974: 84-85) has challenged Hunt's thesis,
 cogently pointing out that the dotted line on Champlain's map of 1632,
 which is sometimes said to represent Brule's route to the Carantouan-

 nais, may in fact mark an earlier French coureur de bois route into these

 regions. Daillon's remarks (Thwaites, 1895-1901 (3): 809) regarding the

 presence of the coureur among the Neutral for some time prior to

 1626 provides contemporary evidence to substantiate Wright's sugges-

 tion.

 In his Observations on Certain Ancient Tribes Hoffman (1964) has ex-

 amined in detail the relationship between the Massawomeck and a num-

 ber of Iroquoians. Following his detailed examination of Swedish and
 Dutch references in conjunction with the Lederer map of 1672 and the
 Herrman map of 1673, Hoffman concluded: "The equivalence of the
 names Massawomeck and Black Minqua [Erie] thus seems to be indi-

 cated strongly" (ibid.: 204). Weslager (1972:99) supports this identifi-

 cation. Hoffman also remarked that the "Evidence relating to the pos-

 sible equivalence of the names Massawomeck and Erie is scanty, being
 limited to the general correlation of the position indicated by the Smith

 and Lederer maps with that indicated for the Erie (Eriehronon) by the
 French sources" (ibid.: 204). Merrill (1979: 552, n 14) espouses the iden-

 tification of the Massawomeck as Pocoughtranacks or Erie who were at

 war with the Moyancer, the Piscataway.

 On the basis of his examination of the early literature and the ar-
 chaeological evidence, Hoffman (1964: 222) has concluded that the Mas-
 sawomeck were either Whittlesey on the south shore of Lake Erie, or
 Monongahela on the headwaters of the Monogahela and Youghiogheny
 rivers in Pennsylvania.

 Although not wholly germane in the context of this work, Hoffman's
 investigation of Black Minqua and Arrigahaga connection with the Erie;

 Black Minqua connections with the Arrigahaga and the Richahecrian; Ri-

 chahecrian and Rickohockan4 connections with the Erie; and Richahecrian

 connections with the Rickohockan provide the basis for a broader un-

 derstanding of Indian groups in this region.

 White (1978: 412) rejected Hoffman's (1964) proposal to extend Erie

 territory into Virginia " . . . by equating Erie, on the basis of similar

 cartographic locations, with the Pocaughtawonauck, Massawomeck,

 Massomack, Black Minqua, Arrigahaga, Richahecrian and Ricko-

 hockan." She concluded: "The assignment of such a vast area on the

 basis of weak and disputed evidence seems unacceptable and at odds

 with the size of territories identified with the Huron confederacy, the

 Iroquois league, or the Neutral" (ibid.).

 More recently Menard and Carr (1982: 171, 186) have suggested that

 the Iroquois who raided the Piscataways on the Potomac River were the

 Seneca.

 Swanton does not include the Massawomeck in his Indian Tribes of

 North America (1952) and they are mentioned but twice, both times only

 in passing, in the current Handbook of North American Indians, Northeast,

 Volume 15 (Trigger 1978).

 ' Hoffman's text regarding the Rickohockans does not include Smith's reference to the
 Righkahauck in his True Relation (Barbour 1969: 178), if indeed these are synonymous. Righ-
 kahauck was a Chickahominy village on the Chickahominy River which Smith visited in
 November or December 1607 (ibid.: 477). Mooney (1907: 131) identified the Richahecrian
 and the Rickohockan as Cherokee. On the other hand Swanton (1946: 111) has noted that,
 "It is now known quite definitely that the Rechahecrians (sic) who won the battle against
 the allied Powhatan Indians and the Virginia colonists in 1656 were not Cherokee, and
 there is no certainty that the Rickohokans of whom Lederer speaks were that tribe." Wash-
 burn (1978: 96) has raised the possibility that the Rickohokans were Iroquoians.

 IV. DISCUSSION

 T here can be little doubt that some seventeenth century primary
 and contemporary accounts and maps are flawed. Smith's per-

 sistent location of the Massawomeck on a body of salt water in

 the hinterland, his European settlement at Ocanahonan, and the location

 of the Atquanahucke homeland in the interior are clear examples of mis-
 understood accounts related to him by the Indians. But Smith's mis-

 conceptions are not unique nor are others so readily reconcilable. Dis-

 tortions undoubtedly attended the translation process in which

 Susquehannock Iroquoian accounts were translated into Tockwogh Al-

 gonquian before they were rendered to Smith in English or in a Pow-

 hatan dialect he could understand. However, attempts to detect and

 compensate for these distortions would likely create even greater errors.

 Apart from recognizing these "honest" mistakes, we need to be able to

 detect and understand the root causes for the deliberate exaggeration,
 or diminution, of events which were vital to the furtherance of the causes

 espoused by the principals, both Indian and European.

 Fleet's Journal reflects the biases necessary to foster his trading inter-

 !sts in what appear to be his exaggerated estimates of the Massawomeck

 population and the quantities of beaver they had to trade, but there is
 no apparent self-serving reason why Fleet should be devious or mis-

 informed regarding the identity of the Hereckeene, Erie, masquerading

 as Massawomeck or the four groups which he states comprised the Mas-
 sawomeck "confederacy." Fleet's account of the number of days travel

 to the Massawomeck homeland may seek to conceal the location of his

 lucrative fur sources, but having been largely collaborated indepen-
 dently by Calvert's account two years later, this seems unlikely.

 Champlain's accounts and his maps must also be regarded with re-
 servation in this context. His information regarding the location of the

 Antouhonorons must have been derived from Indian accounts, but his

 comprehension of these relations, exemplified by his having first located
 the Neutral south of Lake Erie, does not inspire great confidence re-
 garding his ability to place the Antouhonorons. Champlain too was the
 victim of misunderstanding, error, and translation distortions akin to

 those which plagued English accounts of events on Chesapeake Bay.

 The cartographic evidence also merits notice in this regard. Although
 Smith differentiates between the regions depicted by his 1612 Virginia
 map which were recorded during his reconnaissances and those which
 he attributes to accounts by the Indians, this separation has been
 blurred, and French maps, which might appear to be independent

 sources which confirm the location of the Antouhonoron territory in the
 Niagara region ca. 1616, are in fact derivative maps which simply repeat
 information provided earlier by Champlain.

 With these general reservations in mind, we can examine the problems
 of Massawomeck identity, the location of their homeland, and several
 corollary matters.

 IDENTITY

 Edward Fleet's unique account of his eight-day stay with the Mas-
 somack (Massawomeck) in 1632 indicates they were a discrete group,
 possibly a tribe, governed by four 'kings'1 whose towns, and possibly
 the "kings" too, were known as Tonhoga (Tohoga), Mosticum (Mos-
 tikum), Shaunetowa, and Usserahak. Significantly in this context the Us-
 serahak and Mosticum Massawomeck made it clear to Fleet that they
 were not Hereckeene, (Neill 1876: 31; Wright 1974: 85), a synonym for the

 Erie, or a portion of that group. The information that Fleet planned to
 trade with all four of the Massawomeck "nations," each of which was
 governed by a "king" and Usserahak Massawomeck advice that the Mos-
 ticums were "one of their confederate nations," provides some idea of
 the Massawomeck political structure.2 Tonhoga, Mosticum, Shaunetowa,
 and Usserahak were large settlements, the last allegedly having a pop-
 ulation of 7,000. He also recounted visiting thirty Massawomeck pali-
 saded villages, one of which had three hundred houses. By this account
 the Massawomeck population in 1632 far exceeded the five thousand
 Algonquians which Smith estimated to live within sixty miles of James-
 town ca. 1608.

 The Massawomeck are conspicuous in English accounts of tidewater
 Chesapeake Bay Algonquians during the period 1607-1634, both as a
 result of the English having heard of their activities from the Indians
 and of Smith having encountered them once on the Bay. They appear
 on several seventeenth century English maps, none of which signifi-
 cantly enhances the documentary information available. Apart from the
 Delisle map of ca. 1700, the Massawomeck do not appear in French
 literature or on French maps at any time, by that name or any of the
 known synonyms. The inference is clear. Either the French did not know
 of the Pocoughtranack/Massawomeck/Massomack at all, or they knew
 them by a name which has not yet been equated with Massawomeck
 or any of its synonyms. Bearing in mind Susquehannock and Tockwogh

 1 Smith's Virginia map of 1612 indicates that in 1608 the Massawomeck had three "kings'

 houses." In 1632 Edward Fleet indicates there were four kings each with a village (Neill
 1876: 27).

 2 McCary and Barka (1977: 64) suggest the "kings' houses" indicated on Smith's Virginia

 map were tribal capitals or political centers.

 explanations to Smith in 1608 how the Massawomeck obtained European

 material from the French by that date, the latter option appears likely.

 ACCESS TO CHESAPEAKE BAY

 The route taken by the Massawomeck from their hinterland homeland

 to Chesapeake Bay during John Smith's era, ca. 1608, remains uncertain.

 Nevertheless, the record of their activities at tidewater generally is con-

 centrated on the axis of the Potomac River. In 1607 shortly after the

 English arrived at Jamestown, Powhatan explained to Smith how the

 Massawomeck frequently attacked the Anacostank and Potomac in the

 region below the Great Falls of the Potomac (Arber 1884; cxiv; Barbour

 1969: 186). Later from ca. 1627, events regarding the Massawomeck fur

 trade with the English recounted by Fleet are also centered on the Po-

 tomac River, as are the accounts of the Virginian and Marylander fur

 traders in 1632 and 1634. Significantly the Powell and Todkill relation

 also explains how on the lower reaches of the Potomac River from Point

 Lookout to the Wicomico River " . . . we could see no inhabitants" (Bar-

 bour 1969: 402). This is the region, which by 1634, the Yaocomicos were

 forced to abandon to avoid being harassed by raiding Susquehannock.

 Possibly the Susquehannock raids along the west shore date from ca.

 1608, although that is not collaborated by Smith's account that they knew

 little of Powhatan and he as little of them (Quinn 1979 (5): 323).

 The Massawomeck may also have entered Chesapeake Bay on one of

 the rivers which flow into the Bay between the Patuxent and Susque-

 hanna rivers. Russell and Todkill related how in that region for " . . . 30

 leagues we sailed more Northwards not finding any inhabitants yet the

 coast [be] well watered" (Barbour 1969: 402; Quinn 1979 (5): 320). Later
 they noted again that "thirty leagues Northward [from the Patuxent

 River] is a river not inhabited, yet navigable, for the red earth or clay

 resembling bole Armoniak the English calld it Bolus" (Barbour 1969: 342).

 It was off this Bolus river, the present-day Patapsco River, that Smith

 met the Massawomeck party crossing the Bay in canoes in 1608 (Barbour

 1969: 406; Quinn 1979 (5): 322). At the head of Chesapeake Bay at an
 uncertain location where it divides in two channels and farther on into

 four, Smith found these channels uninhabited (ibid.). The information
 contained in the instructions Gates received in 1608, while erroneous
 in part, recounts how the Massawomeck make " . . . continual incur-

 sions upon . .. all those that inhabit the Rivers of the Bolus . . . " (Bar-
 bour 1969: 267). Jefferson (Bozman 1837: 112-14; Peden 1955) has sug-

 gested that the Massawomeck came to the coastal regions through
 " . . . the back parts of Pennsylvania and entered Chesapeake Bay at

 the Bush River . " immediately south of the mouth of the Susque-
 hanna River.

 It does not seem likely that the Massawomeck gained entry to Ches-

 apeake Bay on the Susquehanna River although it has been suggested

 that they" . . paddled their bark canoes down the Susquehanna" to

 tidewater (Weslager 1983: 27, 33).3 Massawomeck-Susquehannock hos-

 tility, which has been stressed in the primary and contemporary records,

 does not suggest that the Susquehanna River would be open to the

 Massawomeck within the territory dominated by the Susquehannock.

 In concert these accounts suggest that there was an unpopulated cor-

 ridor from the Bay to the hinterland, a no-man's-land, between the Pa-

 tuxent and Susquehanna rivers through which the Massawomeck trav-

 eled to Chesapeake Bay ca. 1608, having left the Potomac River at some

 point above Great Falls. Whether this region was uninhabited because

 it was the route followed by the greatly feared Massawomeck, or an

 uninhabited region used by the Massawomeck to avoid the populated

 Potomac River axis below Great Falls, is uncertain. Probably both were

 factors in the selection of a secure Massawomeck route to and from the

 Bay.

 TRADE

 Gallatin (1836) has suggested that the Massawomeck party encoun-

 tered by Smith on Chesapeake Bay in 1608 were " . . . probably Iroquois

 fulfilling their career of conquest." Fenton (1940: 235) believed them to

 be a war party whose homeland was on the Susquehanna River above

 the Susquehannock homeland. Certainly Powhatan's relation in 1607

 and subsequent English accounts of Massawomeck attacks at the head

 of the Bay and on the Piscataway and the Potomac on the axis of the

 Potomac River (Barbour 1969: 186) indicate that Massawomeck intru-

 sions into these regions were hostile.

 This hostility on the west shore of the Bay and at the head of the Bay

 stands in sharp contrast to Smith's remarks regarding Massawomeck

 relations with the bands he visited on the east side of the Bay south of

 Tangier Sound (Hewitt 1907 (1): 7) in the summer of 1608. There the

 Kuskarawocke, Soraphanigh, Nause, Arsek and Natuaquake4" . . . much ex-

 3 A cartouche in the lower left corner of the Augustin Herrman map of 1673 states in
 part that the Susquehanna River is: ". . . full of falls and isles until about 10 or 12 miles
 above the Sasquahana fort [Canooge in the Lancaster Pa. area] then it runs clear but
 Downwards not navigable but with greater danger with Indian Canooe by Indian Pilots."

 4 Strachey (Wright and Freund 1953: 57) states that Powhatan had dominion over ". . .
 some petty Nations on the East syde of our bay." These bands include the Accohanock and
 Accomack which lie to the south of the Nanticoke bands on Tangier Sound. Both Smith
 (Barbour 1969: 344) and Strachey (Wright and Freund 1953: 57) indicate these bands were
 under Powhatan's suzerainty. Subsequently scholars have supported this affiliation (Brin-
 ton 1884: 226; Hodge 1907 (1): 7; Barbour 1969: 169, 1986 (2): 107). Speck (1928: 233, 287),
 following Mooney's (1907) lead, places the Accohanoc, the Accomac, and other Algonquian
 bands south of the modern Maryland line under Powhatan suzerainty while those to the
 north of that line were practically independent. However, he goes on to suggest that
 because these bands spoke the Powhatan dialect they can be considered to be in Powha-
 tan's confederacy. While that arrangement may have served Speck's purpose to cluster
 these bands linguistically, this work will emphasize Smith's explanation that at least some
 of these bands "extolled" Powhatan's enemy the Massawomeck, an option not enjoyed
 by Powhatan's bands on the west shore of the Bay and only after ca. 1627 by the Conoy
 bands to the north.

 tolled a great nation called Massawomecks" (Barbour 1969: 401; Quinn

 1979 (5): 320). Tooker (1894: 181) has suggested that in this context

 "much extolled" indicates these bands were friendly with, and in some

 manner allied to, the Massawomeck who came to this region to trade

 furs for marine shell beads, " . . . as the work Kuskarwoke denotes."

 Having had an opportunity to reflect upon his Jamestown experiences,

 Smith concluded in 1624 in his General Historie (1624: 61) that he had

 found the bands in the Tangier Sound region who traded with the Mas-

 sawomeck were " . . . the best merchants of all other savages." Signif-

 icantly, when Powhatan recounted to Smith the names of his bands who

 were preyed upon by the Massawomeck, he made no mention of these

 eastern shore bands having been attacked. Barbour's map (1969: 169),

 which purports to indicate the extent of Powhatan's suzerainty, also

 excludes the bands on the Tangier Sound from his dominions.

 There is good evidence to indicate that Massawomeck intrusions into

 these regions would be advantageous. By 1608 a significant quantity of

 European material was concentrated in this region. As Smith explained:

 " . .. now by trucking [trading] they have plenty of the forme [tool

 types] of yron. An these are their Chief instruments and arms" (Barbour

 1969: 358). Strachey confirms this assessment of plenty remarking how

 " . .. by trucking with us they have thousands of our iron hatchets such

 as they are" (Wright and Freund 1953: 107).

 These Massawomeck raiding and trading activities in the Chesapeake

 Bay region where European material was readily available by 1608 re-

 sulted in the movement westward of both European goods and marine

 shells, particularly Busycon laeostomum, generally on the axis of the Po-

 tomac River to the Massawomeck homelands and beyond to the Neutral,

 Petun and Huron (Pendergast 1989). But this concentration of European

 material in the hands of Chesapeake Bay Indians cannot be attributed

 to the Jamestown colonists alone. In May 1607 soon after the colonists

 arrived and before the presence of the settlers had significantly increased

 the quantity of European goods available in this region, a delegation

 from Jamestown, which included George Percy, visited the Apamatick

 (Appamatuck), their Algonquian neighbors nearby on the James River.

 There Percy remarked upon seeing " . . . pieces of yron able to cleave

 a man in sunder" (Barbour 1969: 138).

 The concentration of European material in this region long predated

 the establishment of the Jamestown colony in 1607. In addition to the

 Strachey's hearsay advice (Wright and Freund 1953: 56) that the Tockwoghs were under
 Powhatan's dominion is discounted somewhat by his earlier information (ibid.: 49) that
 they, like the Kuskarawoaks, were in the "envyron" of Powhatan's empire. Certainly Smith's
 account of Tockwogh relations with the Susquehannock in 1608 does not suggest that they
 were under Powhatan suzerainty. This is borne out by Smith's statement in his 1612 Map

 of Virginia which states that the people at the head of the Bay, which includes Tockwogh,
 ". . . are scarce known to Powhatan" (Barbour 1969: 343) and by the Powell and Todkill
 account in The Proceedings which states that ". . . these know no more of the territories of
 Powhatan then [sic] his names and he as little of them" (Barbour 1969: 408; Quinn 1979
 (5): 323). Smith repeats the Powell and Todkill account in his General Historie (1624: 61).

 36 THE MASSAWOMECK

 English colonization attempt at Roanoke over the period 1584-1606, nu-

 merous Spanish, French, and English voyages are known to have en-

 tered the Bay prior to 1607.5 These, together with numerous unrecorded

 European visits which can neither be demonstrated nor denied, pro-

 vided ample opportunity for significant quantities of European goods

 to have been acquired by the Indians in these latitudes before the arrival

 of the Jamestown colonists. Contemporary records do not indicate that

 there was a comparable concentration of European material elsewhere

 south of Norumbega, generally south of Cape Cod, prior to 1600, which

 would serve to attract marauding hinterland Iroquoians in search of

 European goods in the sixteenth century.6

 This image of plenty in the Chesapeake Bay region may appear to be

 at variance with isolated English accounts if they are taken out of context.

 For instance, Edward Wingfield's contemporary account describes how

 in 1608 an Indian messenger from Powhatan to the English at Jamestown

 I The recorded voyages to the Chesapeake Bay latitudes prior to 1607 include the Ver-
 razano landing on the Delmarva Peninsula in 1524 where he kidnapped an Indian boy;
 the possibility of Quexos having been in Chesapeake Bay in 1525; the Spanish voyages
 which resulted in the Bay being recorded first on the world map of Juan Vespucci of 1526
 and the description of the Bay set out in Alonso de Chaves's unpublished Quatripartitum
 Opus of 1536 or 1537 (Cumming 1982: 275, 277); Velasco's account of English seamen having
 been in the Chesapeake Bay several times before 1546; the presence of a French privateer
 trading in the Bay in 1546; the presence of the Vilafafie supply ship at Axacan inside the
 Bay in 1561 when Don Luis was kidnapped; the massacre and plunder of the Jesuit Axacan
 mission in 1570; the Menendez de Aviles punitive expedition to Axacan in 1572; voyages
 associated with the founding of the Roanoke settlement in 1585; Lane's exploration to the
 foot of Chesapeake Bay over the winter 1585-1586; the English ship taking on fresh water
 in Chesapeake Bay in 1586; the introduction of additional settlers at Roanoke by White in
 1587; the English ship that took on water in Chesapeake Bay in 1587; the extensive re-
 connaissance of Chesapeake Bay to the mouth of the Susquehanna River by Gonzalez in
 1588 and the secret voyages commissioned by Ralegh to rescue the Roanoke settlers after
 1586, even as late as 1608 (Quinn 1979).

 Unrecorded voyages, some of which undoubtedly also introduced European material into
 Chesapeake Bay, are indicated by the English and French privateers and pirates who
 frequented this coast. Some of these, as is evidenced by the French ship in 1546, entered
 and traded in Chesapeake Bay (Quinn 1979 (1): 217). Probably Portuguese fishermen also
 entered the Bay. Since the first decade of the sixteenth century they had annually sailed
 northward to the fishing banks of Baccalaos (Quinn 1979 (1): 278).

 6 As late as 1605 Champlain specifically noted how in Norumbega the Armouchiquois
 were still dependent upon stone tools, except for a few metal axes they had obtained from
 Acadia (Biggar 1921: 338). In 1609 on Lake Champlain when Champlain first met the
 Iroquois, probably the Mohawk, he noted their use of stone tools and a few ". . . poor
 [metal] axes which they sometimes win in a war. . . " (Biggar 1925: 96). At present the
 orthodoxy suggests that this European material originated in the Newfoundland-Gulf of
 St. Lawrence latitudes to the exclusion of all other regions. Unless convincing evidence can
 demonstrate the exclusivity of the St. Lawrence region in this regard, longstanding doc-
 umentation which demonstrates the presence of Europeans in Chesapeake Bay and No-
 rumbega (Feest 1978, 1978 (a), 1978 (b); Quinn 1977, 1979) (5) cannot be overlooked as
 credible evidence of an equally plausible source for the material seen by Champlain in
 1609. It should be noted in this connection that there is no record of Europeans being on
 the Hudson River, or on the Atlantic coast in that region, before the Dutch ca. 1609, apart
 from Verrazano in 1524. This explanation is not intended to deny that by 1580, possibly
 by 1562, the St. Lawrence region was a growing source for European material (Le Blant
 et Beaudry 1967; Pendergast 1985).

 suggest that perhaps it was the exotic nature of the particular trifles this

 messenger received that caused him great wonder. Had he been given

 a European item then commonly encountered in that region, possibly

 an iron hatchet, he mnight not have reacted in a manner likely to cause

 Wingfield to comment.

 At present no great antiquity can be attributed to the Massawomeck

 practice of seeking European material at tidewater; it appears to have

 become commonplace within Powhatan's lifetime. Nevertheless, ac-

 counts by Powhatan in 1607 indicate that the Moyoancer (Piscataway)

 had long been harassed by the Massawomeck (Barbour 1969: 186), and

 remarks by the Jamestown settlers indicating that the Susquehannock

 and Tockwogh were " . . . continually tormented by them" (ibid.: 361,

 401; Weslager 1983: 32), and Strachey's explanation that " . . . the Pat-

 tawomecks the Pawtuxunts the Susquesahanoughs the Tockwoghs are con-

 tynually harrowed and frightened by them" (Wright and Freund 1953:

 107) indicate that marauding Massawomecks had been present at tide-

 water for some time prior to 1607. The Susquehannock and Tockwogh

 experiences related to Smith in 1608 at the head of Chesapeake Bay also

 suggests that marauding in this region also enjoyed some antiquity.

 The Massawomeck attack on the Tockwogh village and their willing-

 ness to be coaxed aboard Smith's boat in July 1608 provides some idea

 of Massawomeck determination to acquire European goods even in the

 face of danger. Their readiness to trade even their weapons to Smith in

 return for European trifles while still deep in enemy territory reveals the

 extent to which they were prepared to go and the extent to which the

 Massawomeck dominated the region and the contempt in which they

 held these Algonquian bands. Even while deep in Algonquian territory,

 a few Massawomeck had no particular fear of being attacked by the

 tidewater Algonquians said to be some 5,000 strong at that time. Smith's

 encounter with the Massawomeck canoe party is reminiscent of Jacques

 Cartier's experience on the Bay of Chaleur in 1534. There too the Indians,

 in this case Micmac, demonstrated their eagerness to trade with Euro-

 peans. Whether these Micmac and Massawomeck had had previous but

 unrecorded trading experience with Europeans remains to be demon-

 strated, but certainly both reacted quickly to exploit the opportunity

 at hand to obtain European goods.

 Smith's encounter with the Patawomeck (Potomac) in June 1608, dur-

 ing his return voyage southward along the west shore of Chesapeake

 Bay following his visit to the Tockwogh village, is noteworthy. Although

 the Potomac and probably their neighbors the Moyaones (Piscataway),

 Nacothtant (Anacostank), and Taux (Patuxent); had been " . . . com-

 manded to betray us by Powhatan's direction," they "kindly used"

 Smith and his party (Barbour 1969: 403). This does not suggest that these

 bands on the northern environs of Powhatan's dominions were, at this

 time, wholly subordinate to Powhatan, as sometimes has been sug-

 gested (McCary 1957: 6). Indeed, this loose affiliation of Algonquian

 bands on the periphery of Powhatan's "empire" on the west shore of

 the Bay indicates how by 1608 the Nanticoke bands on the east shore

 of the Bay south of Tangier Sound were able to establish and maintain

 an amicable trading relationship with the Massawomeck while the core

 of Powhatan's Algonquian "empire" remained hostile to them.

 The trading patterns which were extant in Chesapeake Bay ca. 1608

 were not immutable. By 1627 there is no evidence that the Massawomeck

 were trading with the Nanticoke bands on the east side of the Bay in

 the Tangier Sound region. Nor is there any record of their having at-

 tacked the Susquehannock and Tockwogh at the head of the Bay, al-

 though these raids may have continued unrecorded. By that date they

 have developed a more secure source of European goods adjacent to

 their new homeland in the Chesapeake Bay hinterland. Following a

 punitive campaign against the Moyancer Piscataway ca. 1627 in which

 large numbers of Piscataway were killed (Neill 1876: 25; Menard and

 Carr 1982: 186), the Massawomeck established suzerainty over the Po-

 tomac River Conoy bands, forcing them to acquiesce to arrangements

 whereby the Anacostank, and to a lesser extent the Piscataway, served

 as middlemen in the Massawomeck fur trade with the Virginians and

 Marylanders (Neill 1876; Hoffman 1967: 8, 38 n. 3; Feest 1978 a: 243).

 Undoubtedly these Conoy bands sought to dilute Massawomeck control

 when they met with Calvert and Fleet in 1634 to negotiate an association

 with the English (Menard and Carr 1982: 171). Possibly they were suc-

 cessful, for this is the last year the Massawomeck are known to have

 been trading on Chesapeake Bay.

 THE FRENCH CONNECTION

 Powhatan's relation to Smith in 1607 is the earliest English evidence
 of a connection between New France on the St. Lawrence River and the
 Chesapeake Bay region. At that time Powhatan indicated to Smith how

 at Ocanahonan, an unknown location beyond the headwaters of the James

 River and on a sea beyond the "Quirank" mountains, there lived people
 who wore European clothing and sailed in European ships. Ocanahonan
 was said to be located on the "same sea" as the Pocoughtronack
 (Massawomeck) (Barbour 1969:182-83, 186). This explanation has raised
 the possibility that the identification of Ocanahonan could help locate the

 Massawomeck homeland. The possibility has also arisen that the Eu-

 ropeans at Ocanahonan may have been the source of the French European

 goods the Massawomeck are alleged to have obtained on the "river of

 Cannida," as the Susquehannock and Tockwogh related to Smith in

 1608. However, an examination of the evidence concerning Ocanahonan

 (Appendix 'B') demonstrates conclusively that there is no connection

 between Ocanahonan and the Massawomeck. Again, Smith had mis-

 understood the briefing he had received from Powhatan in 1607.

 Probably the best-known account of a Massawomeck connection with

 the French on the St. Lawrence River is set out by Nathaniel Po(w)ell

 and Anas Todkill in the Proceedings. In this work they recount how during

 Smith's meeting with the Susquehannock in a Tockwogh Algonquian

 village they heard in July 1608: " . . . many description and discourses

 they made us of Atquanahucke, Massawomeck and other people, sig-

 nifying they inhabit the river of Cannida, and from the French to have

 their hatchets, and such tools by trade . . "(Barbour 1969: 408; Quinn

 1979 (5): 323).

 This text requires close scrutiny to discern that the Susquehannock

 are explaining to Smith that it is the Massawomeck who obtain European

 material from the French. Later when Powhatan corrected Smith re-

 garding the location of the Atquanahucke homeland making it clear that

 they lived on Delaware Bay, he removed the Atquanahucke from those

 who lived on the "river of Cannida" and those who received European

 material from the French in New France (Smith 1624: 61). Remarkably

 it has long been contended that it was the Susquehannock who were

 trading with the French to the north and so served as middlemen to

 redistribute this French material from the north and at the head of Ches-

 apeake Bay (Stith 1747: 69; Hunter 1959: 13; Quinn 1977: 451; Ceci 1977:

 71; Brasser 1978: 81; Feest 1978 (a): 255; Cumming 1982: 281; Jennings

 1982: 219; Trigger 1985: 143, 155; 1988: 257-8). David Quinn (1973: 459)

 has suggested that the heavy iron weapons "able to cleave a man in

 sunder" seen by George Percy in the Appamatuck village on the James

 River in 1607 (Purchas 1625(18): 412; Barbour 1969: 138) may have been

 obtained "through" the Iroquois traveling to the St. Lawrence River to

 trade with the French.

 Francis Magnel's Relation of the First Voyage at the Beginning of the James-

 town (1610) states in part: " . . . the natives of Virginia assure them [the

 English] that on the other side of Virginia by the South Sea there is a

 land where the natives wear long silk robes and buskins, and that they

 have a great deal of gold, and that ships often come to the said land

 which bargain with the natives there and take gold and silk from there,

 and in proof of this those of Virginia showed the English some knives

 and other things which they got from those who came in the said ships,

 and the English judge that the said ships would be Spanish" (Barbour

 1969: 156). Nevertheless, there is at present, no evidence to demonstrate

 the reality of the Tockwogh and Susquehannock accounts which claimed

 that, commencing before 1608, the Massawomeck had obtained

 " . . . hatchets and such tooles by trade" from the French on a regular

 basis. There are, however, accounts of events in 1634 by several inde-

 pendent sources which support the credibility of a trading connection

 between the Canada region on the St. Lawrence River and the hinterland

 Massawomeck and Hereckeenes Erie who lived between Chesapeake

 Bay and lakes Ontario and Erie. Principal among these is Fleet's account

 which relates how in July 1632 while trading with the Hereckeenes Erie

 he saw in their possession two English axes. By Fleet's account these

 axes were the type Sir David Kirke traded at Quebec during the period

 1629-1632. It is interesting to note that he (Fleet) identified these axes

 as being identical to the axes he had obtained from "Whitts of Wapping"

 in London for his use in the English fur trade on Chesapeake Bay. The

 Hereckeenes could have been regaling Fleet with tales of trade with the

 English in the Canada region to obtain some trading advantage by per-

 fidiously displaying English axes which in fact they had acquired on

 Chesapeake Bay, but this seems unlikely in the light of subsequent

 events.

 Soon after Fleet had seen the English axes with the Hereckeenes, the

 Massawomeck fur traders of Great Falls related to Smith the reputation

 of the Hereckeenes as the "Cannyda Indians" who did " . . . drive a

 trade in Canada at a plantation which is fifteen days journey from this

 place," their homeland. In May 1634 Calvert confirmed these accounts

 of the trading connections with the Canada region by relating how the

 English colonists on Chesapeake Bay had lost access to some 3000 beaver

 pelts when their trading partners, the Massawomeckes, had recently

 directed all their trade to Kirke at Quebec. Certainly there was a con-

 centration of European material on the St. Lawrence River by this date.

 French traders had ascended the St. Lawrence River as far as the Lachine

 Rapids by 1580, possibly as early as 1562 (Le Blant et Beaudry 1967;

 Pendergast 1985), but the Hereckeenes and Massawomeck may not have

 had to travel to the St. Lawrence River to obtain European goods. Dail-

 lon's letter (Sagard 1636) indicates how prior to 1626 French coureurs de

 bois had visited Ouontisation, a Neutral village at the head of Lake Ontario

 one day's journey from the Seneca: "Many of our Frenchmen who have

 been here [at Ounontisaston] have in the past made journeys to this coun-

 try and to the Neutral Nation for the sake of reaping profit and advantage
 from the furs."7 Roy Wright (1974: 85) has suggested that the dotted

 line south of a much distorted Lake Erie on Champlain's map of 1632,

 which is sometimes said to be Brule's route to the Carantouannais in

 1615, may in fact represent an early cc -elir de bois trading route into

 those regions which was in use by that date.

 This evidence of the Hereckeene Erie having traded with the French

 before ca. 1632 contrasts sharply with current orthodoxy which holds

 that the French did not encounter the Erie until after 1656 when they

 7A considerably less detailed account of Daillon's experiences at Ouontisaston appears

 were first seen as captives among the Five Nation Iroquois. However,

 because the evidence in support of the Hereckeene Erie having traded

 in the Canada region relates to a period prior to 1634, and 1632 in par-

 ticular, it may be that it took place over the period 1629-1632 when the

 English under Kirke occupied Quebec. In that event the French may not

 have encountered the Hereckeene Erie in this context.

 There is additional evidence that hinterland Iroquians could have ob-

 tained European goods introduced by the English on the axis of the St.

 Lawrence River without their having to go to Quebec. Soon after the

 Kirke brothers occupied Quebec in July 1629 there arose a conflict be-

 tween the Kirkes and a group represented by Sir William Alexander.

 Matters were resolved when the two factions joined to form the Company

 of Adventurers to Canada. Moir records (1966: 405) that this Company

 " . . . prosecuted the fur trade, contended with attempts to trade by

 both French and English interlopers, maintained two hundred men in

 Canada, and explored 400 leagues into the interior." This suggests there

 was ample opportunity for frontier and hinterland tribes to acquire Eu-

 ropean goods introduced by the English during the Kirke interlude with-

 out their traveling to the Canada region on the St. Lawrence River. It

 also enhances the credibility of the Massawomeck explanation that the

 Hereckeenes traded for European material at a "plantation" fifteen days

 journey from their homeland. Heretofore there has been little to support

 the possibility of European traders, particularly English ones, in the

 Iroquoian hinterland. This too explains, in part, the two English axes

 from Whitts of Wapping, London, which Fleet saw with the Hereck-

 eenes on the Potomac in 1532 and Calvert's explanation that the

 Marylanders had arrived too late in 1534 to have access to the furs which

 were traded to the Kirkes at Quebec.

 LINGUISTICS

 In his 1612 Map of Virginia John Smith remarked upon the variety of

 languages which were spoken in the regions surrounding Chesapeake

 Bay. In particular he noted: " . . . many several nations of sundry lan-

 guages that environ Powhatan's Territories. The Chowanokes [Algon-

 quians], the Mangoags [southern Iroquians], the Manacans, and Manna-

 hokes [both are eastern Siouans], the Massawomeckes [northern

 Iroquoians], the Powhatan [Algonquians], the Susquesahanocks [northern

 Iroquoians], the Atquanachukes, [Algonquians], the Tockwoghes [Nanti-

 coke Algonqian]. Al those not any one understandeth another but by

 Interpreters" (Barbour 1969: 344; 1986 (2): 107; Smith 1624: 25; Wright

 and Freund 1953: 49). Accounts of Smith's encounter with the Massa-

 womeck crossing Chesapeake Bay in canoes indicate clearly that, except
 by signs, he was wholly unable to communicate with them (Barbour

 1969: 407). Neither could the Massawomeck converse in any of the Al-

 gonquian dialects in which Smith had demonstrated a competence nor

 in the dialects used by his interpreters to communicate with the various

 Algonquian bands Smith encountered on his journey around the Bay.

 Several scholars have sought to identify the Massawomeck linguistic

 affiliation. In 1881 Gatschet interpreted "Massawomecke" to be Algon-

 quian for those on a great water which, he suggests, is in keeping with

 the lacustrine homeland location attributed to them by the Susquehan-

 nock and the Tockwogh. Having examined Edward Fleet's 1632 record

 of the Massawomeck words for town and band names in conjunction

 with words which Margry indicates were recorded by La Salle in the

 Lake Erie region in 1699, and in conjunction with the words recorded

 by Abbe de Gallinee (Rene de Brehant de Gallinee) who accompanied

 La Salle, Gatschet concluded:

 From all facts stated it becomes apparent that the "Herechenes" were not in-

 cluded in the term Massawomecke, but that this term comprehended at least one

 of the Five Nations, The Senecas, and that the three others [mentioned by Fleet]

 were allied or confederated with them. Indian history sufficiently proves that

 it is more natural to suppose racial and linguistic affinity between the four chief-

 taincies of the Massawomeckes [Fleet gives four, Smith indicates three], than

 to build them up of tribes of disparate affinities and heterogeneous elements.

 What we cannot possibly decide now, for want of sufficient information, is

 whether the three other tribes formed, with the Shaunetowa, the four villages of

 the Senecas mentioned by Gallinee, or whether they were scattered all the way

 from Lake Ontario to the Ohio River, as the name Tonhoga seems to indicate.

 To assume that the Massawomeckes were the Shawnees would be to assume

 they had formed an alliance with the Shaunetowa, or Seneca" (Gatschet 1881:

 322-24).

 Tooker (1894: 183) argues Massawomecke is an Algonquian word mean-

 ing those who go and come by boat, or those who travel by boat.

 Hewitt (1910: 658-59) concluded that of the twelve populous seden-
 tary tribes listed in the Jesuit Relation for 1635 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8):
 115) as dwelling south of the French settlements, the Scahentoarronons,

 or Akhrakvaerton as they were known in Huron, were probably the Mas-
 sawomeck. He derived this identification from a linguistic analysis of a
 number of Iroquoian and Algonquian roots. Hewitt translated Scahen-

 towanenrhonons as people beyond big meadows. This was the Huron and
 Iroquois word for the Wyoming plain on the Susquehanna River in the
 vicinity of present day Wilkes-Barre. Hewitt (1910: 658) quotes Hecke-
 welder's suggestion that Wyoming is a Delaware cognate term derived
 from a translation of the Iroquois word. Heckewelder indicated M'cheu-
 omi or M'cheuwami signifies "extensive level flats" in Delaware. The Del-
 aware locative term would be M'cheoming or M'cheuwaming meaning "at
 the great flats or plains" which the English changed into Wyoming. The
 animate plural added to the first of these locative terms would produce

 M'cheuomek which, Hewitt contends, Smith heard in another Algonquian

 dialect as Massawomecke.

 Two entries in the Jesuit Journal for 1652 indicate the Iroquois defeated

 the Atra'kwae'ronnons or Adasto'e'ronnons that year. Hewitt suggests that

 the identification of the Atra'kwa'e as Andasto'e " . . . is probably due to

 a misconception of the relator." He supported this identification of the

 Massawomeck by drawing attention to the fact that Smith, on his 1612

 map Virginia and Champlain on his 1632 map indicate that the Mas-

 sawomeck and the Carantouannais respectively both have three "King

 houses" or towns. Interpreting Smith's observations somewhat subjec-

 tively when he introduces the Potomac River specifically, Hewitt noted

 that the Massawomeck were located "beyond the mountains from

 whence is the head of the river Potawomeck . . '" and " . . . higher up

 in the mountains . . . " than the Susquehannock. He concluded, "These

 references to the presence of mountains in the country of the Massa-

 womeckes well describe the mountainous regions of the upper Sus-

 quehanna r[iver] and its branches," including the Wyoming Flats area.

 Fenton (1940: 232-39) has suggested there were at least two groups

 of Iroquoians on the Susquehanna River. Those on the lower reaches

 of the river were the roily water people, known to the French and Huron

 as the Andaste, or Andastoerrhonon or Ganadstoguehronons and to the

 English as the Susquehannock or Conestoga and as the Minqua or White

 Minqua to the Dutch and Swedes. By Smith's account they were located

 some fifty miles above the rocks near present day Port Deposit, Mary-

 land, which marked the head of navigation, or possibly at Falmouth

 Falls south of Canewago Creek (Hewitt 1910: 654; Fenton 1940: 237).

 Fenton's second group were the big flats people or the Skahendawaneh-

 ronon, Hewitt's Scahentowanenrhonons, and Brebeuf's Scahentoarrhonons

 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8): 115), who were on the North Branch of the

 Susquehanna River on the Wyoming Flats above present day Wilkes-

 Barre. Fenton suggests they were also Smith's Massawomeck and Brule's

 Carantouannais (Biggar 1929: 217, 1632 map).

 In support of this conclusion Fenton examined the location of the six

 Susquehannock villages shown on Smith's 1612 Virginia map and the

 location of the tribes shown on the Dutch Carte Figurative of ca. 1614

 drawn by the Dutch fur trader Adriaen Blockx (Cummings et al 1971;

 265) and redrawn by William Blaeu for his Novus Atlas (Goss 1990a:164;

 1990b:68). As a result he presented the following three-faceted argument

 used by Hewitt to equate the Massawomecke and Wyoming, quoting

 as references Hewitt's correspondence with Stirling dated 20 December

 1936, and Bureau of American Ethnology Ms. No. 3816:

 1. "The linguistic equivalence of Algonquian Massawomecke and Wy-

 oming to Iroquoian Scahentoa-and Carantouan [Skahentawaneh]-
 meaning "big grassy flat";

 have three kings' houses on Smith's map of Virginia, 1612, and the

 Relations, vol. 8, p. 115) . . . Andastoerrhonons (Susquehanna), Sca-

 hentoarrhonons (Wyoming), Riierhonons (Erie), and Ahouenro-

 chrhons (Wenro), which clearly shows his Huron informants con-

 sidered them distinct tribes."

 Current archaeological data do not support Fenton's hypothesis.

 The McFate-Quiggle sites on the West Branch of the Susquehanna River

 and the archaeological sites in the Wyoming Valley which, having

 yielded no European material, are attributed to a prehistoric period prior

 to the arrival of Europeans. Both these peoples are believed to have been

 destroyed ca. 1525-1550, by the Susquehannock Iroquoians when the

 latter moved southward from Bradford County at the junction of the

 Chemung and Susquehanna rivers to Lancaster County near Chesa-

 peake Bay, where their archaeological sites date from ca. 1600. After the

 inhabitants of the Wyoming Valley were destroyed by the Susquehan-

 nocks that region remained uninhabited until the Algonquian Conoy

 bands and Nanticoke moved into that region ca. 1730.8

 Michael Foster (pers. comm. 1987) having examined the Massawo-

 meck words for their kings and villages (To(n)hoga, Usserahak, Shaun-

 netowa, and Mosticum) has opined that apart from Mosticum they are

 "possible-even likely-Iroquoian words." To(n)hoga is a plausible Ir-

 oquoian word which could mean something like "the junction of two

 creeks or small rivers (Lounsbury 1960: 53), although there is too much

 distortion to be certain. Usserahak is more certainly an Iroquoian word."

 Foster explains it consists of a noun root meaning "basswood." Fenton

 (per. comm. 1987) has suggested "basswood opening." Chafe (1967: 55,

 item 646) indicates that the modern Seneca name for present day Buf-

 falo, New York, is "basswood." This connection, however tenuous, ac-

 8 During the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth centuries, several groups oc-

 cupied the Susquehanna River valley. The McFate-Quiggle people were located on the
 West Branch, the Wyoming Valley people were in the vicinity of Wilkes-Barre, and the

 Shenks Ferry people were in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania near the Maryland line.
 Initially and prior to ca. 1550 the Susquehannock were located in Bradford County, Penn-
 sylvania, near the junction of the Susquehanna and Chemung rivers near the New York
 state line. Circa 1550 the Susquehannock left their homeland in Bradford County in the
 north to move southward through the Susquehanna River valley to the region south of
 present day Lancaster, Pennsylvania, near the mouth of the Susquehanna River.

 The archaeological material excavated on McFate-Quiggle sites on the West Branch and
 that on Wyoming Valley Complex sites in the vicinity of Wilkes-Barre indicate that these
 people were not Susquehannocks. Nor is there any evidence of European material on
 these sites. Having no evidence that they moved elsewhere intact, they are believed to
 have been destroyed in-situ during the period 1525-1550 by the Susquehannock when they
 moved southward through these regions to the new Susquehannock homeland in Lan-
 caster County. One thing is certain. By the time the Susquehannock had moved through
 and beyond the West Branch and Wilkes-Barre regions, these areas were no longer in-

 cords well with the initial location of the Massawomeck in the Niagara

 Frontier region ca. 1608 as postulated here.9

 Foster goes on: "Shaunetowa is plausibly Iroquoian and the final ele-

 ment owa strongly suggests one form of an Iroquoian root meaning large,

 great, or grand. While there is a superficial resemblance to the early

 French name for the Seneca, too much distortion would be necessary

 to make that a serious connection." Foster also raises the possibility

 "whether Shaunetowa could be a form of an Iroquoian word which has

 come down to us both as Skenondoah and Skenandore, the Susquehanna

 River and an Oneida family name Skennontonah or Skennontonha" (Louns-

 bury 1960: 65). In that event the meaning could be "deer," an important

 Iroquoian moiety or clan, particularly in the Huron. In this context it is

 interesting to compare these Massawomeck names with the Susque-

 hannock clans and nations as they were recorded in 1666: Dahadaghesa,

 the Turtle clan; Sarangararo, the Wolf clan; Gosweinquecrakqua, the Fox

 clan; Waskanecqua of the Ohongeoquena nation; Kagoregago of the Unque-

 hiett nation; Saraqundett of the Kaiquariegahaga nation; Uwhanhierelera of

 the Usququhaga nation and Waddonhago of the Sconondihago nation (Hew-

 itt 1910: 653-54). A Deer clan is not included.

 habited and continued to be uninhabited until ca. 1730 when Conoy Algonquian bands

 and Nanticoke moved into the region in colonial times.

 In Bradford County, the prehistoric home of the Susquehannock, the protohistoric Sus-

 quehannock archaeological sites contain a small amount of European material, usually

 scraps of metal (Dunbar and Ruhl 1974). These sites are dated ca. 1550, slightly later than

 the McFate-Quiggle sites on the West Branch and the Wyoming Valley Complex in the
 Wilkes-Barre area where no European goods attributable to this era have been excavated.

 Upon their arrival in Lancaster County near the mouth of Susquehanna River ca. 1575
 the Susquehannock encountered the indigenous Shenks Ferry people. Conflict and Eu-
 ropean disease soon depleted the Shenks Ferry people so that over the period 1575-1600
 their survivors were assimilated by the Susquehannock. From this time onward, through
 to the period when the Susquehannock encountered Smith in 1608, the Susquehannock

 occupied what is now Lancaster County. Archaeological sites in this region which have
 been attributed to this period; the Washington Boro site ca. 1600-1625, the Roberts and
 Billmeyer sites ca. 1625-1645 and the Strickler site ca. 1645-1665 and later sites all contain
 large amounts of European material which, with the possible exception of certain glass

 beads, cannot be demonstrated to have been introduced by a specific European national

 group, or attributed to a particular documented encounter between natives and Europeans.

 This understanding of Susquehanna River Valley archaeology does not support a hy-
 pothesis in which ca. 1600 the Susquehannock located at the head of Chesapeake Bay
 served as middlemen to distribute European material they received from a northern source.
 While it accords well with the hypothesis which ca. 1635 has the "roily water people"

 living along the lower river at the falls (Fenton 1940: 232), there is no archaeological evi-

 dence to support a second group, "the big flats people," on the North Branch above
 Wyoming (ibid.). Archaeological evidence indicates that the Wyoming area near Wilkes-

 Barre was uninhabited from ca. 1525 when the Wyoming Valley Complex was destroyed
 until ca. 1730 when Conoy Nanticoke established a village, the Knouse site, in this area
 (Kent 1984: 18, 122-23, 306-307, 401).

 (This synopsis of Susquehanna River valley archaeology is derived from several sources,
 principally Witthoft 1969, Kinsey 1969, Kent 1984, Lucy and McCracken 1985, and Mc-
 Cracken 1985).

 9 It should be noted that the "basswood" connection is not peculiar to the Niagara region
 alone. Fenton (1940: 229) indicates that the large Seneca village at Boughton Hill was known
 to some Mohawk as Kohoseraghe, "basswood place," and the surrounding area was known
 as the place with "basswood bark lying around."

 46 THE MASSAWOMECK

 ETHNOGRAPHIC COMPARISONS

 The bark canoes luted with gum used by the Massawomeck (Wright

 and Freund 1953: 108; Barbour 1969: 361) contrast sharply with the dug-

 out canoes used by the tidewater Algonquians. George Percy in his

 Discourse (Barbour 1969: 134) describes Algonquian dug-out canoes forty-

 five feet long which had been made from a whole tree. In his True Relation

 (1608: 358) Smith notes some canoes were " . . . an elne deep and 40 to

 50 foot in length and some will bear 40 men but the most ordinary are
 smaller and will bear 10, 20, or 30 . . . ." Spelman's account of the Mas-

 sawomeck using dug-out canoes ca. 1609 in their war with the Potomeck

 (Smith 1624: 33; Arber 1884: cxiv; Tooker 1894: 184; Hoffman 1964: 199)
 appears to reflect a Massawomeck readiness to use captured Algonquian
 dug-out canoes which would be better than their Iroquoian elmbark

 equivalents.

 Close reading of Fleet's account of the use "birchen canoes" on the

 Potomac in 1632 (Neill 1876: 26) will reveal that these were used by the

 Piscataway, not the Massawomeck. However, it seems likely that these

 canoes had been obtained by the Piscataway from a group farther north,
 possibly the Massawomeck, as a result of their fur trading activities.

 In his Map of Virginia (Barbour 1969: 361) Smith notes that Massa-
 womeck" . . . Targets [shields], Baskets, Swords, Tobacco-pipes, Plat-

 ters. Bowes and Arrowes and everything they showed" were much su-

 perior, he says "much exceeded," to those used by Chesapeake Bay
 Algonquians. Although these comparisons set Massawomeck artifacts
 apart from the tidewater Algonquians, the information is insufficient to
 permit a significant conclusion regarding the identity of the Massawo-
 meck.

 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

 At present, and apart from certain artifacts excavated in connection

 with known European settlements, installations, and habitation sites,
 the European material from Indian archaeological sites which can be
 attributed to the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seven-
 teenth century, still cannot be identified, unequivocably, as having been
 introduced by the nationals of a specific European country. Nor can the

 European material excavated from Indian sites be attributed, with cer-
 tainty, to a documented event when Europeans are known to have in-
 troduced European material into the Indian community, or are known
 to have been in the company of Indians in the region. Consequently it
 is not possible, at present, to provide evidence which can, with rea-
 sonable certainty, be used to demonstrate the direction from whence
 came the European material excavated.

 No archaeological sites have been identified which can be attributed
 to the Massawomeck. Indeed, until a territory can be attributed to them,

 DISCUSSION 47

 it does not appear likely that specific sites can be investigated to ascertain

 whether they can be attributed to the Massawomeck. Until this can be

 done it will not be possible to compile criteria against which to compare

 and contrast Massawomeck archaeological data with those of other Ir-

 oquoian groups. Nevertheless there are aspects of the Jamestown set-
 tler's accounts regarding their relations with the Indians which are man-

 ifested in current archaeological data.

 Strachey's remarks regarding the large quantity of English axes in the

 Indian community by 1608 are borne out by existing Susquehannock

 archaeological data. The twenty-four iron axes excavated at the Wash-

 ington Boro site, a Susquehannock early historic village dated ca. 1600-

 1625 (Kent 1984: 292), represents a five-fold increase in the incidence of

 these European tools over those from the nearby Schultz site dated ca.

 1575-1600, which is believed to be the next earliest site in the Susque-

 hannock archaeological sequence. The quantity of European goods ex-

 cavated on the Washington Boro site is not exceeded until the mid-

 seventeenth century when fifty-three axes appear on the historic Strick-

 ler site which is attributed to the period 1645-1665 (ibid.).

 Archaeological data from farther afield, although sometimes more

 oblique, are germane in this context. The thin scattering of European

 iron and brass excavated on early Seneca and Onondaga protohistoric

 sites closely resembles the situation on early protohistoric Susquehan-

 nock sites in Bradford County. This similarity has been remarked upon

 by Heisey and Witmer (1962: 108), Kinsey (1969: 67), and Bradley (1979:

 379) who have attributed this patterning of European material on pro-

 tohistoric Iroquois sites to the last half of the sixteenth century. Bradley

 (ibid.: 380) also explains how on " . . . 16th century Onondaga sites a

 correspondence exists between the increasing presence of European

 goods and a growing influence of southern [in part Susquehannock]

 traits." He elaborates on this relationship in his recent work The Evolution

 of the Onondaga (1987: 60, 90, 96-99, 103). Nevertheless, it remains to be

 demonstrated whether these Seneca and Onondaga obtained this ma-

 terial with southern traits by preying directly on Chesapeake Bay Al-

 gonquians and the Susqhenannock or whether they obtained it from
 middlemen who had received it from these tidewater people. Like all

 Five Nation Iroquois, the Seneca and Onondaga were located on or near

 the headwaters of the Susquehanna River at this time, so they were in

 regions in which the terrain provided best access to the Susquehannock

 villages in the Susquehanna River valley, however hostile their reception
 might have been. Possibly the Massawomeck, who certainly did inter-
 vene at tidewater, played some intermediary role in the introduction of

 European goods and marine shell to the Five Nation Iroquois, at least to
 those Iroquois with whom they were allied, ca. 1615, but this has not

 been demonstrated.

 V. HYPOTHESES

 T his work demonstrates the elasticity of the confusion which some-

 times occurs when different European observers refer to the same

 group of Indians, often at different times and in different places,

 using different names. Here we have on one hand John Smith, an En-

 glishman in Virginia in 1608, using mid-Atlantic Algonquian information

 and names to describe a group of Indians, and on the other hand we

 have Champlain, a Frenchman in Huronia in 1615, using Iroquoian in-

 formation and names, specifically Huron-dialect Iroquoian, to describe

 the same group of Indians.

 Discussion cannot but arise regarding the possibility that there were

 Massawomeck elements, possibly those peripheral to the main group,

 whose "history" might not be wholly congruent with the hypothesis
 proferred here. Certainly experience with better-known Iroquoian

 groups suggests that this would not be unusual. Unfortunately the scope
 and nature of the primary and contemporary sources on which this work

 is premised, perforce, does not permit a discussion based on evidence

 regarding either the existence of peripheral Massawomeck groups, or

 how their "history" might vary from the main-line events examined

 here. To do so on the basis of the evidence extant would, I believe, lead
 us into a morass of speculation premised on an endless proliferation
 of 'if' and 'perhaps'. I have opted to explain the evidence extant.

 TWO MASSAWOMECK HOMELANDS

 Seventeenth-century primary and secondary accounts regarding the

 Massawomeck indicate that in the period 1607-1634 they occupied two

 distinct and widely separated territories. Initially ca. 1608 they were

 located in a lacustrine territory associated with the St. Lawrence River,

 the "River of Canada," in a manner not yet understood clearly. Later

 ca. 1632 when they were visited by Edward Fleet, they were located in

 the Appalachian hinterland not far from Chesapeake Bay remote from

 the "river of Cannida."

 In 1607 Smith learned from Powhatan that the Massawomeck home-

 land was a riverine or lacustrine territory. In 1608 the Tockwogh and

 Susquehannock confirmed this location. Although Powhatan had made

 it clear to Smith in 1608 that the Massawomeck were located on a fresh-

 water lake, Smith continued to describe this as a marine location as late

 as 1612 (Barbour 1969: 361, 414). Three primary sources' independently
 describe it as on the "river of Cannida" or in "some part of Commada"

 (op. cit.). Both the early seventeenth-century maps which depict the
 Massawomeck, the Zuniiga sketch map of ca. 1608 (Fig. 2) and Smith's
 Virginia map of 1612 (Fig. 1), place the Massawomeck in a lacustrine

 location. William Blaeu's map of 1630 (Portinaro and Knirsch 1987: pl.

 74), which is a detailed reproduction of Smith's map Virginia, adds noth-

 ing new in this regard. Nevertheless, there is not a shred of evidence

 to suggest that this information was derived from Europeans who visited

 the Massawomeck homeland during the first decade of the seventeenth

 century. All the data available regarding this location of Massawomeck

 territory reflect what the Virginians learned first-hand from widely sep-

 arated and independent Indian accounts-two Algonkian, Powhatan

 and Tockwogh, and one Susquehannock Iroquoian.

 On the basis of this evidence, it is postulated that ca. A.D. 1607 the

 Massawomeck were located in the region at the east end of Lake Erie

 or the west end of Lake Ontario, east of the Niagara River. In either of

 these locations they would be associated with the "river of Cannida"

 in the context of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River waterway. At this

 time and in this location they would be in a position to receive European

 material from the French as the Susquehannock and Tockwogh had

 related to Smith in 1608. The absence of any French notice of this trade

 suggests that they obtained French goods through Huron and Neutral

 middlemen.2 This is not a new idea. In 1881 Royce (1881: 179, 181),

 having studied much the same evidence which has been examined here,

 1 In The Proceedings Powell and Todkill state the Massawomeck "inhabit the river of

 Cannida" (Barbour 1969: 408; Quinn 1979 (5): 323). Smith repeated this information in his
 Map of Virginia (Barbour 1969: 361). In 1624 in his General Historie Smith stated that the
 Massawomeck were either from "some part of Commada" or "an inlet on a sea" (1624:
 33). Once again Smith has indicated a marine location in spite of the fact that Powhatan
 had corrected him on this point in 1608. Strachey repeated Smith, placing the Massa-
 womeck in "some part of Caneda, some great lake, or some inlet of some sea that may
 fall into the West Ocean" (Wright and Freund 1953: 107). It is not certain whether Strachey
 is here simply ignoring Powhatan's correction regarding the salt-water sea, or was in fact
 unaware that Powhatan had corrected Smith.

 2 The earliest archaeological evidence of European material among the Ontario Iroquois

 has been dated to the end of the first quarter of the sixteenth century, although there are
 claims for some being present as early as the end of the fifteenth century (Noble 1980: 4;
 Trigger 1976: 449 n 40; 1985: 151). At that time European goods received initially by the
 Montagnais from French and Basque fishermen on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and in the
 Strait of Belle Isle were moved northward on St. Lawrence River tributaries in that region
 to the hinterland Algonquians. In the region where these St. Lawrence River tributary
 headwaters are adjacent to the headwaters of the Ottawa River, particularly at the head-
 waters of the St. Maurice River, European goods entered a zone where the Algonquian
 bands were either in contact with the Huron or with other Algonquian bands, the Nip-
 pissing for example, who were in contact with the Huron. As a result of this trading on
 the hinterland river networks European material became available to the Huron long before
 Europeans encountered Huron traders on the lower St. Lawrence River in 1609.

 From ca. 1580, possibly as early as 1562, French fur traders had been trading in significant

 numbers on the St. Lawrence River as far up as the Lachine Rapids (LeBlant et Beaudry
 1967; Pendergast 1985). While there is no evidence of these Europeans having ascended

 50 THE MASSAWOMECK

 suggested that ca. 1608 the Massawomeck homeland was located in the

 Niagara region.

 Evidence regarding the location of the second Massawomeck home-

 land is more substantial. Edward Fleet visited the Massawomeck ter-

 ritory in 1632, and spent "seven days going and five days comming"

 back to the Great Falls on the Potomac (Neill 1876: 28). Estimates prem-

 ised on the length of his journey and a reasonable distance to travel

 each day led Hoffman (1964: 200-201) to suggest Fleet would have ar-

 rived at the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River. Had

 he crossed the watershed into the Ohio River drainage he would have

 entered the region in which the headwaters of the Monongehela or the

 Youghiogheny rivers rise.

 Fleet did not place the Massawomeck in a lacustrine location nor did

 he associate this Massawomeck territory with the "river of Cannida."

 Indeed, Fleet's account in 1632 stands in sharp contrast to Smith's ac-

 count in 1608. Now it was the Hereckeenes (Erie), who lived three days

 journey beyond the Mosticum Massawomeck, which carried on a "trade

 in Cannida" with the French on the St. Lawrence River. On the other

 hand by 1632 the Massawomeck had turned to Algonquian middlemen

 on the Potomac River where they had an arrangement which permitted

 them to have access to the European material being introduced into

 Chesapeake Bay. Calvert's experience in 1634 emphasizes the impor-

 tance of this trade to the English and in so doing provides a glimpse of

 Massawomeck involvement in a wider trade than Fleet describes. His

 explanation that the Massawomeck "cometh seven, eight, and ten day

 journey" to trade at the mouth of the Potomac River generally confirms

 Fleet's location of the Massawomeck homeland, but the travel time,

 which is in excess of that related by Fleet, suggests that the Masso-

 womeck homeland may have included territories beyond the Potomac

 River in the Ohio River watershed.

 Jansson's map America Septentrionale of 1636 (Goss 1990b: 72) is the

 earliest to place the Massawomeck in the Chesapeake Bay hinterland,

 a location compatible with accounts by Fleet and Calvert. Dudley's de-

 rivative map Virginia Vecchio e Nuoua of 1647, which has been described

 as one of the best maps of Virginia in the seventeenth century, also

 places the Massawomeck in this location. Farrar's map of 1651 (Fig. 4)

 and the Hondius-Visscher map of 1669 (G. Shilder World Map of 1669)

 (Fig. 6), both of which are largely derivative, also place the Massawo-

 the St. Lawrence River beyond the Lachine Rapids in the sixteenth century, there is every
 likelihood that European goods introduced by these traders at the Lachine Rapids were

 moved onward to the Ontario Iroquois and the hinterland by the Ottawa River Algonquian
 allies of the Montagnais on the axis of the Ottawa River and possibly on the axis of the
 St. Lawrence River. The presence of European goods on the latter route has not been
 demonstrated. In 1626, which is somewhat late in this context, the visit of the Ottawa
 River Algonquian chieftain Iroquet to the eastern villages of the Neutral (Sagard 1636) sug-

 gests that there was person-to-person contact between Algonquians located on the lower
 Ottawa River, not far from the Lachine Rapids, and the Iroquoians at the head of Lake
 Ontario. Daillon makes it clear that by 1626 French coureurs de bois from the Canada region
 were trading in the region at the head of Lake Ontario with some regularity (Sagard 1636).

 meck in an Appalachian hinterland. Lederer's note on his 1672 map

 (Fig. 5) that "The Massawomeck dwelt heretofore beyond these moun-

 tains" is the last reference to the Massawomeck on a contemporary map.

 The location of the Massawomeck on the wholly derivative Delisle map

 of ca. 1700 simply reflects this and earlier information. Neither Lord
 Baltimore's earlier English map Noua Terrae-Mariae of 1635, revised by

 John Ogilby in 1671 (Cumming 1982: 288) nor William Blaeu's earlier
 Dutch map Nova Belgica et Anglia Nova of 1635 (ibid.: 284) indicate a
 location for the Massawomeck or the Antouhonorons, although the lat-

 ter incorporates, severely distorted, the St. Lawrence River and the Lake

 Ontario regions.

 On the basis of this evidence, it is postulated that by ca. 1627 the

 Massawomeck homeland was located in the hilly Appalachian hinter-

 land in the region between the headwaters of the North Branch of the

 Potomac River and the headwaters of the Youghiogheny River. Here

 between Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay the Massawomeck were adja-

 cent to and three days journey from the Hereckeene Erie. They were

 also on, or adjacent to, the headwaters of streams which provided access

 to Chesapeake Bay where European material was available. There is no

 evidence that the Massowomeck continued to carry on a trade in marine

 shell with Algonquians in the Tangier Sound region, from their Ap-

 palachian homeland.

 IDENTITY OF THE MASSAWOMECK

 It is proposed to examine the Indian groups which appear on sev-

 enteenth-century maps in the two homeland locations which have been
 attributed to the Massawomeck by primary and contemporary sources.

 Champlain's map of 1616 (Fig. 7), which is the first to depict the interior

 beyond the foot of Lake Ontario (Wroth 1952: 2), provides the earliest

 record of people between lakes Ontario and Erie in the region east of

 the Niagara River. There, in an understandably distorted representation

 of the local geography, Champlain places the Antou-honorons. This map,

 which was published in 1619 to accompany his work Les Voyages, in-

 corporates information Champlain had received during the period 1615-

 1618. As a result his knowledge of the Antouhonorons must be attributed

 to his Indian associates, probably the Huron and the Ottawa River Al-

 gonquian Ononchataronon and their chief Iroquet.

 Champlain's map Carte de la Nouvelle France of 1632 (Fig. 8) is the next

 map to depict the region between lakes Ontario and Erie. This map,

 which represents hinterland geography more accurately, locates the An-

 touoronons (sic) in the region adjacent to Lake Ontario a short distance

 east of where he placed the Antou-honorons on his 1616 map. Apart from

 La nation neutre, which Champlain located on the south side of Lake Erie,

 the remainder of this region is unoccupied. Although Champlain names

 explanatory text he refers to it several times as 'the lake of the Entou-

 viction that the Antounoron homeland was in some manner closely as-
 sociated with Lake Ontario.

 The Nouvelle France map of ca. 1641 (Fig. 9) has been attributed to Jean
 Bourdon (Heidenreich 1988) who, having arrived in New France in 1634,
 visited the Mohawk with Father Jogues in 1646. His duties as clerk of
 the Communaute, which required him to travel extensively to supervise
 the fur trade (Hamelin 1966), provided him an opportunity to become
 familiar with the interior. He locates the Akhrakvaetonon in the region

 rad Heidenreich has noted (pers. comm. 1987), that both these maps

 were printed from Champlain's 1632 copper plate.

 The Sanson map Amerique Septentrionale of 1650 (White 1978a: 414)

 locates the N. Neutre north of Lake Erie and the N. du Chat at the east

 end and south of Lake Erie, but leaves the region east of the Niagara

 River unlabeled. As a result neither the Antou(h)onorons nor the Akh-

 rakvaetonon are indicated. Sanson's map Le Canada ou Nouvelle France of

 1656 (White 1978a: 415) locates the Attiou anaarons beyond the mountains

 at the headwaters of what appears to be the Appomattox River and again

 in the region north of Lake Erie as the Neutre ou Attiouandarons. The

 Eriechronons ou N. du Chat are located south of Lake Erie. The area east

 of the Niagara River carries only the caption Ongiara Sault. Once again

 neither the Antou(h)onorons nor the Akhrakvaetonon are indicated. Hei-

 denreich (pers. comm. 1987) has suggested that the Indian names on

 the Le Canada ou Nouvelle France map are derived from the Nouvelle France

 map of ca. 1641 which has been attributed to Bourdon. Sanson's map

 Le Nouveau Mexique et La Florida, which was also published in 1656, does

 not include the Neutral but continues to locate the Eriechronons south

 of and at the east end of Lake Erie. The Ongiara are placed immediately

 east of the Niagara River. Neither the Antou(h)onorons nor the Akhrak-

 vaetonon are mentioned on this map.

 Du Val's Le Canada map of 1653 (Fig. 10), which is derived from Cham-

 plain's of 1616, duplicates exactly Champlain's location and spelling of

 the Antouhonorons. However, in designating the Nation du Chat for the

 first time and placing them correctly on the south side of Lake Erie where

 Champlain had located the Neutral in 1632, Du Val appears to have had

 access to information which was not available to Champlain in 1616 and

 1632. Du Val also correctly locates the Neutral on the north side of Lake

 Erie.

 The Bressani map Novae Franciae Accurata Delineato of 1657 (Heiden-

 reich 1971: map 10) locates the Gens neutre at the head of Lake Ontario

 and the Erie populi well to the south of Lake Erie. Neither the

 Antou(h)onoron nor the Akrakvaetonon are indicated by Bressani.

 Du Creux's 1660 map Tabula Novae Franciae (Heidenreich 1971: map

 11) places the Gens Neutra at the head of Lake Ontario but there is no

 mention of the Erie. An indistinct entry immediately east of the Niagara

 River appears to read Ondaeron II On dieromius pagus. Neither the

 Antou(h)onorons nor the Akhrakvaetonon are located on this map.

 The map dated ca. 1680 which is attributed to Abbe Claude Bernou

 (Trigger 1976: 798; White 1978: 408) locates the Antouaronons (sic) on the

 north shore of Lake Erie together with the information that they were

 a "nation destroyed." The two symbols which accompany this entry

 have been interpreted to indicate the Antouaronons once consisted of

 two villages. The Akhrakvaetonon are not shown on this map. It is possible

 that the location of the Antouhonorons on the north side of Lake Erie

 represents the cartographer's intention to convey the information that

 this "nation" had been destroyed as a marginal note on his map, rather

 than locate precisely a "nation" which was no longer extant. Otherwise
 this location is an error for this is the only instance in which the An-

 touhonoron are located north of the Great Lakes. The J.B. Louis Fran-
 quelin map places the Antouaronons south of Lake Erie with the notation
 that they were a nation destroyed. Both the Bernou and Franquelin maps

 incorporate material derived from LaSalle's explorations in 1669.

 This review of the cartographic evidence indicates that ca. 1608 when
 ]owhatan, the Tockwogh, and the Susquehannock were explaining to
 John Smith how their mortal enemies, the Massawomeck, lived on the
 'river of Cannida" in a location compatible with the Niagara Frontier
 r-egion, contemporary French maps were locating Champlain's Antou-
 ronons and later Bourdon's Akhrakvaetonon in the Niagara River region.
 The close association of these two groups in this context demands that
 they be examined in detail.

 The Akhrakvaetonon

 The Nouvelle France map of ca. 1641 attributed to Bourdon contains

 tfhe only cartographic reference to the Akhrakvaetonon, although they
 appear in contemporary literature several times. They appear first in the
 list of tribes set out in the Jesuit Relation for 1640 (Thwaites 1895-1901
 i18): 232), which is believed to have been derived from Rageneau's lost
 mnap. Here the Akhrakvaetonon appear in the sequence immediately after
 the Aondironon and Ongmarahronon, both of which have been attributed
 lo the Neutral (Hodge 1910: 63; White 1978: 411; Steckley 1985: 12) and

 immediately before the Oneronon, which have been identified as Wenro
 White 1978: 411; Steckley 1985a: 17). In the 1656 list of tribes (Thwaites
 1895-1901 (42): 197) the Akhrakvaetonon are mentioned following the Atir-
 uiguenrek and Atiaonrek, both of which the Neutral names (White 1978:
 411; Steckley 1985: 12), and before the Gentuetehronons, or Gentaguete-
 ionons, an Erie group (Hodge 1907: 490; Fenton 1940: 195; White 1978:
 412; Steckley 1985: 12). Both these listings place the Akhrakvaetonon in a
 sequence which is believed to reflect the relative geographical location
 of these groups. This would locate the Akhrakvaetonon in the Niagara
 RiZiver region. In the 1740s the Akhrakvaetonon were listed after the
 eraenrek or Neutral (Steckley 1985: 12) and before the Rie or Erie

 ibid.). This too places the Akhrakvaetonon in the Niagara River region.
 'Nhile it would be difficult to demonstrate that these three listings con-
 stitute independent sources supporting a single location for the Akh-
 r-akveatonon, they consistently place this group in the Niagara River re-
 gion, a location which accords well with the Bourdon map. The Boucher

 Relation of 1655-1656 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (45): 207) explains that the

 Trakwaehrons, a synonym, are "utter foreigners although they form with-

 out doubt the largest and best part of the Iroquois."

 Other documentary evidence regarding the Akhrakvaetonon has been

 interpreted differently. An entry in the Journal des Peres Jesuits for 4 June,

 1652 chronicles, in part, how two Algonquian women who, having es-

 caped from the Mohawk, related: "The Iroquois, having gone during

 the winter [1651-1652] in'full force against the Atrakwaeronnons Andas-

 toeronnons had the worst of it" (Thwaites 1895-1901 (37): 105). A later

 journal entry for 1 July 1652 clarifies which of these nations had been

 attacked: "The capture of Atrakwae by the Iroquois nations

 of a thousand. They carried off 5 or 6 hundred-chiefly men" (Thwaites

 1895-1901 (37): 111).

 Fenton (1940: 237) has suggested that Atrakwae may refer to Quadrogue,

 the town on Smith's 1612 map near the mouth of the Susquehanna River.

 Hewitt (1910: 112) was prepared to accept Atrakwae(y) as the Conestoga

 village from which the Iroquois took 500-600 prisoners in 1652 and it

 was the seat of the Akhrakvaetonon, a division of the Conestoga, (ibid.:

 658). Hewitt (1910: 336, 657) has also suggested that the Scahentoarronon

 mentioned in the Jesuit list of 1640 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (18): 232), who

 were the people of Wyoming flats, and the Gandastogues or Andasto-

 errhonons mentioned in the Jesuit Relation for 1672 were also Conestoga.

 Having suggested that the Scahentoarrhonon were probably, the Mass-

 awomeck, Hewitt raised the possibility of a Akhrakvaetonon/Scahen-

 toarronon/Andastoerrhonon/Conestoga/Massawomeck synonymy.

 Jennings (1982: 221) has interpreted references to this battle with the

 Iroquois to conclude that Atrakwaeronons was a synonym for the Sus-

 quehannock. Steckley (1985: 13) has interpreted it to indicate that it was

 the Akhrakvaetonon, or Atrakwae (Thwaites 1895-1901 (36): 141; (37): 111)

 in the Huron dialect, and not the Andasterrhonon who were destroyed

 over the winter of 1651-1652. Although the Mohawk are known to have

 attacked the Andaste that winter, amicable relations between the An-

 daste and Mohawk in 1655 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (37): 97; Jennings 1968:

 23-26; 1978: 365) indicate conclusively that the Andaste were not de-

 stroyed at this time. Indeed, if by using the Huron form Aktrakwae for

 the Akhrakvaetonon, Steckley (1985: 13) correctly equates the Akhrakvae-

 tonon with the Seneca or Cayuga Kahkwa, who are recorded on the Ber-

 nou maps of ca. 1680 (Trigger 1976: 798, 838; White 1978: 408) as the

 Kakouagoga "a nation destroyed," it is the more likely that it was the

 Akhrakvaetonon who were destroyed over the winter of 1651-1652.

 In this context it is interesting to note that the Relation of 1655-1656

 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (42): 197) does not list any of these groups as having

 been destroyed by the Iroquois: "I have made you master of the earth

 and victors over so many Nations: I made you conquer the Hurons, the

 Tobacco Nation, the Ahondihronons [a branch of the Neutral (Hewitt

 1910: 63)], Atiraguenrek ['under the Neutral' (Hewitt 1910: 62)], Atianrek

 [probably a synonym for Atiraguenrek, the Neutral], Takoulguehronons

 [otherwise unknown], and Gentaguetehronons [Erie (Hewitt 1910:

 490)]."

 At this juncture several interpretive options arise regarding Akhrak-

 zaetonon synonymy. Following from Hewitt's conclusion (1910: 658) that

 the Scahentoarronon and Akhrakvaetonon were alternative names for the

 same group, the latter being in the Huron dialect, Trigger (1976: 97) has

 suggested the possibility that the early chroniclers had subsumed the

 Andaste and the Scahentoarronon under the general name Susquehannock.4

 Fenton (1940: 232) and Trigger (1976: 97) appear to have embraced with

 some certainty Hewitt's suggestion that the Scahentoarronon/Akhrak-

 vaetonon were probably Smith's Massawomeckes (Hewitt 1910: 657). Fen-

 ton (1940: 232) adds the Carantouan to this synonymy although Cham-

 plain (Biggar 1936 (6): 249-250) refers to them as separate nations sep-
 arated by three days' journey.

 These interpretations raise serious problems quite apart from the ar-

 (chaeological discrepancies which have been mentioned (see Chap. IV,

 n. 8). First, it seems unlikely that as Massawomeckes of the Scahentoar-
 r onon/Akhrakvaetonon/Carantouan/Conestoga/Andaste/Massawomeck
 ctomponent of the Susquehannock could at the same time be the principal
 aind mortal enemy of the same Susquehannock as related to Smith by

 both the Susquehannock and Tockwogh in 1608 in no uncertain terms.

 fFurther, if indeed the Scahentoarronon/Akhrakvaetonon/Conestoga/

 Andaste/Carantuan/Massawomeck group were located on the Susque-

 Jaanna River, in the Wyoming Flats area (Hewitt 1910: 657-58), in rela-

 tively close proximity to the Susquehannock, as suggested by Fenton
 1940: 233-39) and as is implicit in the Hewitt and Trigger interpreta-

 tions, they do not, in that place, accord well with Susquehannock and
 rockwogh explanations regarding the Massawomeck homeland ca.

 1608. Overlooking Smith's erroneous interpretations of Powhatan's re-

 lation in 1607 which placed the Massawomeck in a marine location be-

 4 The Laigniet and de Fer map La Nouvelle France of 1669 separates the Andastocconons
 qui sont (?) porcelaine, who are located on this map at the headwaters of what is clearly the
 Potomac River, from the Susqiquehan??nna who are located on this map at the head of
 Chesapeake Bay. The Andastocchonons qui sont la Porcellaine are also shown on the Boisseau
 map of 1643, Nouvelle France, in much the same Potomac River location. The Susquehan-
 nock are not indicated. Champlain's map of 1632, the DuVal map Le Canada of 1653, which
 closely resembles Champlain's 1632 map, the Boisseau map of 1643, and the Laigniet and
 de Fer map of 1669 locate the Carantouannais on the upper reaches of the Delaware River.
 It is planned to examine the implications of an Andaste location on or near the headwaters
 of the Potomac River very close to the Massawomeck hinterland homeland during the
 period depicted by these maps, some of which are highly derivative. It is anticipated that
 this will have a bearing on the current views regarding the Andaste-Scahentaorronon
 dichotomy of the encompassing term Susquehannock. It may also help further define the
 Scahentaorronon/Akrakvaetonon/Carantouan synonymy.

 yond the hinterland mountains, these twice-told first-hand accounts

 place the Massawomeck in 1608 in a lacustrine location in "some part of

 Commada" where they "inhabit the 'river of Cannida"' (op. cit.). If the

 Massawomeck homeland was on the "river of Cannida," and they were

 known to Fleet as the "Cannyda Indians," it seems unlikely that the

 Susquehannock would place them on the Susquehanna River. Indeed,

 there is no evidence to suggest that the Susquehanna River was ever

 known as the "river of Cannida."

 A new hypothesis is required to reconcile these anomalies. It is, there-

 fore, proposed to remove the Massawomeck from the Scahentoarronon/

 Akhrakvaetonon/Conestoga/Andaste/Carantouan/Massawomeck syn-

 onymy and place them in a location outside the Susquehanna River

 watershed in a "river of Cannida" context compatible with Smith's ex-

 planations of the Powhatan, Tockwogh, and Susquehannock accounts.

 This would not run counter to any sixteenth-century evidence in this

 context, nor would the Scahentoarronon/Akhrakvaetonon/Conestoga/

 Andaste/Carantouan synonymy be called into question.

 On the other hand failure to remove the Massawomeck from the Sca-

 hentoarronon/Akhrakvaetonon/Conestoga/Andaste/Carantouan/Mass-

 awomeck synonymy would raise even more serious problems when

 tested against Fleet's and Calvert's first-hand accounts regarding the

 location of the Massawomeck in the period 1627-1634. At that time fully

 credible accounts by Fleet and Calvert regarding the Virginia and Mary-

 land fur trade with the Massawomeck and their middlemen on the Po-

 tomac River axis (op. cit.) indicate that the Massawomeck were located

 on or near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River,

 or, on or near the Youghiogheny River in the Ohio River basin. Neither

 of these places accord well with those attributed to the Scahentoarronon/

 Akhrakvaetonon/Andaste/Carantouan during the period 1627-1634. It

 should be noted that these observations are wholly independent of the

 polemic regarding Andaste and Susquehannock synonymy.

 The Antouhonorons

 The other Indian group located in the Niagara region ca. 1608 are the

 Antouhonorons. They first appear when Champlain recounts how in the
 Huron village of Cahiaque in 1615 he learned of a Huron plan to join
 their allies the Carantouan in an attack on their common enemy the En-

 touhonorons (Biggar 1929 (3): 53-54; 1932 (4): 244). In his account of the

 journey to attack the Entouhonoron village Champlain mentions the "lake

 of the Entouhonorons," Lake Ontario, several times (Biggar 1929 (3):
 58-59, 62-64, 79). The remainder of Champlain's account has not yet
 served to identify the location of this Entouhonoron village with certainty.

 HYPOTHESIS 63

 Pond, the location which has long been mentioned as being the site of

 Champlain's attack, is not that location.5

 The legend on Champlain's map of 1632 identifies a lacustrine location

 where there was located a "Village surrounded by four palisades, where

 Sieur de Champlain went to war against the Antouhonorons and took

 a number of prisoners." The explanatory text for the 1632 map (Biggar

 1936 (6): 249-50) states:

 "The Antouhonorons comprise 15 villages built in a strong position.

 They are enemies of all the other nations except the Neutrals. Their

 country is a fine one, with an excellent climate, lying near River St.

 Lawrence. This [thus] they prevent all other nations from passing which

 explains why that river is less frequented.6 They cultivate and sow their

 lands."

 "The Iroquois and the Antouhonorons make war together on all other

 nations except the Neutrals."

 "The Carantouanis [sic] are a nation settled south of the Antouhon-

 orons in a very beautiful and excellent country where they are strongly

 established. They are friends with all other nations except the said An-

 touhonorons, from whom they are distant only three days' jour-

 ney. ... ."

 Earlier Champlain had estimated that the Carantouan lived "three long

 days journey beyond the Entouhonorons" (Biggar 1929 (3): 53-54). On

 another occasion he confirmed this estimate stating that the Carantouan

 lived "three good days journey beyond the Entouhonorons" (Biggar 1932

 (4): 244). In 1615 when Champlain dispatched Brule to make contact

 with the Carantouan in preparation for their attack on the Entouhonoron's

 5 The location of the Antouhonoron village attacked by Champlain has long been the

 subject of much discussion. For years the principal contender has been Nichol's Pond near

 Oneida Lake as General Clark suggested, although sites on Onondaga Lake, Cayuga Lake,

 and Canandaigua Lake have also been suggested. Fenton (1940: 213-16) has remarked that,
 "until someone demonstrates that there is a suitable site on the east shore of Onondaga
 lake, the proponents of Gen. John S. Clark's old theory, which favours the Nichols Pond

 site, have offered the only concrete evidence." In his Archaeology of the Oneida Iroquois,
 Pratt (1976) has compiled a comprehensive review of the documentary and archaeological

 evidence having a bearing on the location and identification of the Entouhonoron village
 Champlain attacked. Cogently he has concluded (ibid. 148), "Examination of the natural
 setting, historical documents and maps and of the archaeological record clearly show that

 Nichols Pond [an Oneida archaeological site] was not the site of Champlain's battle in 1615.
 James Bradley plans to examine an archaeological site which, judging from the surrounding
 terrain, appears more likely to be the correct location (pers. comm. October 1988).

 6 Champlain can only have known the location of the Antouhonorons in a lacustrine
 setting at the head of the "lake of the Entouhonoronos," from the Indians or the coureurs
 de bois. Both these groups would understand the geography of an extended Great Lakes-
 St. Lawrence River waterway which underlies Champlain's garbled explanation. Antou-
 honoron domination of the Niagara River, which seems likely, could inhibit the use of
 that waterway by groups in that region and so, by extension, their entry into the St.
 Lawrence. There is no case for placing the Antouhonoron at the east end of Lake Ontario
 to be able better to prevent other nations from using the St. Lawrence River. In that location
 they would be in St. Lawrence Iroquoian territory, where long before 1615 the inhabitants
 of this region had been destroyed.

 village, Champlain instructed him ". . . to go towards the Entouhon-

 orons at Carantouan" (d'aller vers les Entouhonorons a Carantouan)

 (Biggar, 1929 (3): 213-40), thereby raising the possibility that they were

 collocated or nearly so. Beauchamp (1895: 321) had earlier suggested

 that the Carantounnais and the Antouhonarons (sic) were enemies.

 Apart from these cartographic and locational references, the Entou-

 honoron are not often mentioned in the literature. When Champlain

 spent the winter of 1615-1616 in Huronia he interceded on behalf of the

 Algonquian chief Iroquet in a dispute regarding the disposition of an

 Entouhonoron prisoner who had been captured during the attack in 1615

 (Biggar 1929 (3): 99-100, 111; 1932 (4): 283). A Neutral alliance with the

 Antouhonoron, which excluded the Huron, was demonstrated when

 Champlain attempted to visit the Neutral in the winter of 1615. The

 Huron prevented him from making this journey claiming that it would

 not be safe because they had incurred Neutral displeasure when in 1614

 they had killed a Neutral while attacking the Entouhonorons. Here we

 have confirmation, or repetition, of the 1632 map legend regarding the

 Antouhonoron-Neutral alliance.

 Although the Antouhonorons are mentioned in the Jesuit Relations some

 twenty-five times by this and various other spellings, they are not in-

 cluded as Antouhonorons in Brebeuf's list of tribes set out in Le Jeune's

 Relation of 1635 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8): 115-117). Neither are they men-

 tioned in the Relation of 1640 which lists the tribes derived from Rage-

 neau's lost map (Thwaites 1895-1901 (18): 232), nor are they mentioned

 in subsequent lists of tribes (Thwaites 1895-1901 (42): 197). Thwaites does

 not mention them in his extensive notes on the Iroquoian tribes

 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8): 297-302) nor are they included in Hodge's

 Handbook (1910).

 Several scholars have sought to equate the Antouhonorons (Entouhon-

 orons) with one or another of the Five Nation Iroquois tribes. This is

 surprising because Champlain's text explaining his 1632 map clearly

 differentiates between them. He states, "The Iroquois and the Antou-

 honorons together make war against all other nations" (Biggar 1936 (6):

 250) thereby describing two components of a single military alliance.
 Neither do any of the Jesuit appellations used for the "Iroquois" or for
 the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, or Mohawk in the Jesuit Re-

 lations approximate Antouhonorons, or one of its various spelling

 (Thwaites 1895-1901 (8): 115-17; (18): 233-35). Nevertheless this did not

 deter Parkman (1865: 402-403, n 1), Clark (ibid.), Shea (1878: 107), or

 Marshall (1887) from attributing the Entouhonoron village attacked by
 Champlain to the Onondaga. Later several scholars accepted this Onon-
 daga identification (Biggar 1929 (3): 125; Ganong in Biggar 1936 (6): 250;
 Fenton 1940: 213, 216, 235; Bishop 1948: 356). Ganong had earlier iden-
 tified them as Seneca (ibid.: 245). Aptly Trigger (1976: 311) has noted
 that "Biggar [1929 (3): 54, 125; 1932 (4): 304] and his co-workers have

 led many readers astray by their unwarranted substitution of Onondaga

 for Entouhonoron in their translations of Champlain's writings." The

 error had been Parkman's sixty-odd years earlier.

 Laverdiere (1870: 33-34), Thwaites (1895-1901 (8): 293 n 21; (12): 293;

 (72): 322) and Hodge (1912 (2): 191-92) suggest that the Antouhonoron

 were Seneca. Because the Antouhonorons once moved their villages forty

 or fifty leagues, Shea (1870: 28 n 2, 83 n 2) suggests that they may be

 the Wenro who moved to Huronia ca. 1638. Beauchamp (1900: 88) con-

 cluded they were Oneida.

 Hunter (1959: 10) remarks parenthetically that the Entouhonorons

 were "... probably the Seneca or western Iroquois," presumably

 meaning the Seneca and Cayuga. Zeller (1962: 28, 36) has suggested,

 without providing an explanation, that Champlain included the Oneida,

 Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca in the Entouhonoron. Trigger too (1976:
 227) speculates that Entouhonoron was "a term which appears to mean

 the four western Iroquois tribes," that is all the Five Nations except the

 Mohawk. Pratt (1976: 55) suggests that Entouhonoron was a general term
 which encompassed the Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga. He speculates

 (ibid.) that there having been a Neutral killed in 1614 by the Hurons

 when they made war on the Entouhonorons, it appears likely that the

 Entouhonorons were the Cayuga or the Seneca whose territories were

 adjacent to, or not far distant from, the Neutral. Campisi (1976: 490)
 believed Antouhonoron and Entouhonoron were Huron dialect names for
 the Oneida explaining, "however it is unclear whether this term was

 applied solely to the Oneida or to other Iroquois tribes as well." White

 (1972: 70) notes the location of the Antouaronons (sic) on the Sanson map
 of 1656, the Bernou map of 1680, and the Franquelin map of 1684 and
 says that they were a group for "which there is almost no information."
 Later (1974: 71) she identified the Antouaronons with several other groups
 as distinct subdivisions of the Neutral Confederacy. She notes the spu-
 rious location of the Antouaronons on the north side of Lake Erie on the
 Bernou map of 1680 suggesting that later they had moved to the south
 side of Lake Erie into Erie County to escape the Iroquois. In her definitive
 paper "Neutral and Wenro" (1978: 411) she notes the location of the
 Antouhonorons on the Bernou map of 1680 and the Franquelin map of
 1684 remarking that they "... .. probably refer to the Neutral tribe."
 White does not mention the Antouhonorons by that name or any of its

 66 THE MASSAWOMECK

 Champlain's cartography, Explorations and Mapping of Samuel de Cham-
 plain, 1603-1632. He suggests that the Entouhonoron village attacked
 by Champlain was a Cayuga village (Heidenreich 1976: 39-40).

 Roy Wright (1974: 85-85) has raised an interesting question regarding

 the Erie which is germane in the context of this work.

 Beginning with Sagard, the chroniclers repeatedly say that "we" or "our French-

 men" [when they] call the Eries the Nation of (the) Cat(s) (Sagard 1632: 307).
 The fact that another tribe is simply "named. . . " or "called" may simply reflect
 its non-French name, but why would precisely one of the few unseen tribes [by
 the French] receive such a name, and especially why, in this case, should the
 explanatory translation (which quickly predominates over the native term, in-
 dicating greater familiarity of use) be preceded by the indication that we use it?

 Cogently Wright (ibid.) goes on to note how in 1632, the "seven lusty
 men in strange attire" who arrived at Great Falls purporting to be Mos-
 tikum Massomacks, were in fact Hereckeenes who lived three days beyond
 the Massawomeck. They "were not the friends" of the Massawomecks
 (Neill 1876: 30-31). Gatschett (1881: 322-24) and Wright (ibid.) have
 identified these Hereckeenes as Erie. This synonymy is not known to have
 been suggested elsewhere.

 Recently Steckley (1985: 9-13), in a paper which examines the An-
 touahonaron/Scahentoarrhonon/Andoouanchronon relationship, has
 suggested that the latter designation is a copying error. Apart from being
 listed in the 1640 Relation (Thwaites 1895-1901 (18): 232-33) the name

 Andoouanchronon does not appear. If as Steckley suggests (ibid. 11, 13),
 it was intended to be "something like 'Entoouanronon' it would be ac-

 ceptable as Antouahonaron."

 Although the Antouhonorons have been identified as Neutral, or a
 group of Neutrals (Fenton 1940: 198; White 1974: 71, 1978: 411), Steckley
 (1985: 18 n 1), having examined the linguistics of several of the names
 of the Neutral components, states that the Antouaronon were not Neu-

 trals. Nevertheless until a satisfactory interpretation is available to ex-

 plain the significance of the Attouandarons being shown twice in widely
 dispersed areas on the Sanson map of 1656-once as Neutre ou Attioua-
 darons in the southern Ontario region occupied by the Neutral, and once
 beyond the mountains at the headwaters of what appears to be the
 Appomattox River-the possibility of an Antouhonoron/Neutral con-

 nection should not be rejected. The implications of Champlain's advice
 that "The Iroquois and the Antouhonorons make war together on all
 other nations except the Neutrals" cannot but invite scrutiny in this
 regard.

 On the basis of information he received from the Indians, probably
 Huron or Ononchataronon Algonquians, Champlain recounted how on
 one occasion the Antouhonorons were forced by their enemies to move
 their villages some forty or fifty leagues (Biggar 1929, (3): 125; 1932, (4):
 304). At present the archaeology of the Seneca and Cayuga (Wray 1973;

 White, Engelbrecht, and Tooker 1978; Abler and Tooker 1978; Niem-

 czycki 1984; Wray et al 1987), the Oneida (Pratt 1976), and the Onondaga

 (Tuck 1971; Bradley 1987) does not indicate any of these tribes moved

 any of their villages at any time during the seventeenth century any-

 where near the forty or fifty leagues described by Champlain. Unless it

 can be demonstrated that one of the Five Nation Iroquois moved a village

 this distance in the first quarter of the seventeenth century, it seems

 unlikely that a Five Nation tribe can be identified as the Antouhonorons.

 From this record two conclusions germane to this thesis emerge. Circa

 1616 a portion of the region which lies between Lake Ontario and Lake

 Erie east of the Niagara River was occupied by the Antouhonoron and

 the Akhrakvaetonon. It is not clear whether these are the names of two

 distinct groups or synonyms for a single group.

 Apart from their having been destroyed by the Iroquois over the win-

 ter of 1651-1652, there is no additional primary or contemporary evi-

 dence regarding the Akhrakvaetonon. On the other hand there are ac-

 counts associated with the Antouhonoron over the period from ca. 1615

 to some time before 1627. Having remarked on how the Iroquois pe-

 riodically move their villages ". . . one, two or three leagues from the

 former spot, if they are not forced by their enemies to decamp and move

 a greater distance" (Biggar 1929 (3): 125; 1932 (4): 304), Champlain then

 goes on to relate twice how on one occasion the Entouhonorons were
 forced by their enemies to move some forty to fifty leagues,7 a distance

 of 190-250 kilometers or some 120-150 miles, depending on the length

 of Champlain's league.

 It is postulated that the Antouhonoron moved southward to a new

 location forty or fifty leagues from their homeland east of the Niagara

 River, to an area on or near the Youghiogheny River, an Ohio River

 tributary, or possibly to the headwaters of the North Branch of the Po-

 tomac River. In either region they would be located near where Fleet

 and Calvert located the Massawomeck over the period ca. 1627 to 1634.

 While English and French maps place the Massawomeck in this hinterland

 Chesapeake Bay region, none place the Antouhonoron there. The groups

 which are located in these hinterland Chesapeake Bay regions on con-

 temporary French maps are the Atiovandarons on the Bourdon map of

 1641 and the Attiouandarons on the Sanson map of 1656. However out

 of place in this location they may be according to current orthodoxy,

 these are names associated with the Neutral. Nevertheless, this con-

 nection of the Antouhonorons and Massawomeck with the Neutral in

 7 Champlain's league has been variously estimated or calculated as being 2.97, 3.07, 3.12,
 3.51, and 3.52 miles. It has also been suggested that it was the distance traveled on foot
 in one hour. In that event Champlain consistently moved at a faster pace than did infantry
 on paved roads in World War II. At that time 2.5 miles in one hour, which included a ten
 minute break, was the norm, apart from forced or run-walk "speed" marches. Pratt (1976:
 57) has examined these variations in Champlain's league, and their implications regarding
 the identification of Nichols Pond as the site of Champlain's attack on the Antouhonorons.

 68 THE MASSAWOMECK

 a manner not yet clear fits well with Champlain's twice repeated expla-

 nation that, "The Iroquois and the Antouhonorons make war together on

 all other nations except Neutral," and the Huron account of how in 1614

 while attacking the Entouhonrons they had accidently killed a Neutral

 then allied (op. cit.).

 In consequence, it is postulated that the Iroquoians, who were known

 to the French as the Antouhonorons and to the English as the Massawo-

 meck, lived in a location in the region east of the Niagara River prior to

 1627 from where they raided and traded with tidewater Algonquians

 on Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries as related to John Smith in 1607

 and 1608. From their homeland in the Niagara region the Massawomeck

 carried on a trade with their Iroquoian neighbors in European goods

 and marine shell, particularly Busycon laeostomum, which they obtained

 by raiding and trading in the Chesapeake Bay region before ca. 1627

 (Pendergast 1989).

 Sometime prior to 1627, how long cannot be stated with certainty,

 enemies forced the Antouhonorons to move from their homeland in the
 Niagara region to a hinterland location on or near the headwaters of the

 Youghiogheny River, or to the headwaters of the North Branch of the

 Potomac River. There as the Massawomeck Champlain's Antouoronons car-

 ried on a fur trade with the English of Chesapeake Bay over the period

 ca. 1627 to 1634 as related by Gookin, Fleet, and Calvert.

 VI. MODEL

 F rom this uneven, confused, often frustrating, record of primary

 and contemporary accounts, and the accumulation of scholarly

 opinion over the past hundred years or more, there emerges a

 body of information which, with varying degrees of credibility, consis-

 tently supports a hypothesis that during the period ca. 1607 to 1634 the

 Antouhonorons/Massawomeck were essentially the same people. The

 model proposed here, which purports to describe events in this period,

 is based on this hypothesis.

 Circa 1607 the Antouhonorons, a populous Iroquoian tribe, lived be-

 tween lakes Ontario and Erie in the region east of the Niagara River.

 They were allied to other Iroquoians there and, together with these

 Iroquois allies, the Antouhonorons made war on all other tribes in the

 region except the Neutral. For some time prior to 1607 they regularly

 harassed the Susquehannock Iroquoians on the lower reaches of the

 Susquehanna River and the Nanticoke, Conoy, and Powhatan Algon-

 quian bands on Chesapeake Bay. These Antouhonoron Iroquoians were

 known to the Chesapeake Bay Algonquians as Massawomeckes and it

 is by this Algonquian name that they became known to the English

 settlers at Jamestown soon after they arrived in 1607.

 The Massawomeck/Antouhonorons journeyed from their homeland

 in the Niagara region to Chesapeake Bay by way of the Allegheny, Mon-

 ongahela/Youghiogheny, and Potomac rivers. They entered the Bay

 from the middle reaches of the Potomac River by way of the numerous

 small rivers which drain the west shore of Chesapeake Bay between the

 Patuxent and Susquehanna rivers. As a result of their frequent hostile

 incursions the tidewater end of this invasion corridor was uninhabited.

 The Potomac and Pawtuxent bands which were adjacent to the southern

 edge of this corridor were particularly prone to attack by the marauding
 Massawomeck.

 The Susquehannock had come into possession of European goods in
 small quantities ca. 1550 when they were located on the Susquehanna
 River near its junction with the Chemung River. Subsequently they
 moved southward to the lower reaches of the Susquehanna River in the
 vicinity of present-day Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in part to be closer to
 a growing source of European material which had been traded into Ches-
 apeake Bay since 1546, possibly earlier. Sometime before 1608 when on
 the lower Susquehanna River, these Susquehannock came under heavy
 attack by the Massawomeck/Antouhonoron who raided their heavily
 fortified villages in search of European goods.

 70 THE MASSAWOMECK

 The Nanticoke Tockwogh Algonquian band at the head of the Ches-

 apeake Bay on the Sassafrass River, who had by 1608 come under the

 suzerainty of their powerful and more numerous Susquehannock Iro-

 quoian neighbors, also possessed significant quantities of European

 goods. As a result they were a target of the Massawomeck/Antouhon-

 oron marauders. Indeed the Massawomeck canoe party encountered by

 John Smith on Chesapeake Bay on 26 or 27 July 1608 had just raided

 the Tockwogh village on the Sassafras River and their wounded indicate

 the ferocity of this encounter. Seemingly the Massawomeck raiders were

 happier attacking the weaker Algonquian bands than they were engag-

 ing the more populous heavily fortified villages of the Susquehannock

 Iroquois, at least on this occasion.

 The Massawomeck/Antouhonoron were not hostile to all Algonquians

 on Chesapeake Bay. Unlike their Tockwogh cousins to the north who

 reacted with hostility to the Massawomeck as befitted their status as a

 client-band under Susquehannock Iroquoian suzerainty, and the Al-

 gonquians under Powhatan's suzerainty, the Nanticoke bands on the

 east shore of Chesapeake Bay south of Tangier Sound on the Delmarva

 Peninsula had reached an accommodation with the Massawomeck. By

 1608 they had become an amicable Massawomeck/Antouhonoron source

 of European material and marine shell, particularly the marine whelk

 Busycon laeostomum which is peculiar to these latitudes.

 European material and marine shell gleaned by the Massawomeck/

 Antouhonorons raiding and trading into Chesapeake Bay returned with

 them to their homeland in the Niagara region. Some of the material was

 later distributed farther afield in the Iroquoian hinterland by ritualistic
 gift-giving and trade. The exotic value of these materials as gifts in the

 traditional Iroquois practice of ritualistic gift-giving cannot but have been

 enhanced in regions far from their source on Chesapeake Bay. The Neu-

 trals, the only nation apart from their Iroquois allies with whom the

 Massowomeck were not at war, were favored in the distribution of these

 goods. Subsequently some of the material received by the Neutral, both

 European goods and marine shell, were traded onward to the Petun

 and Huron. The presence of Busycon laeostomum from the Chesapeake

 Bay latitudes, both intact shells and artifacts made from fragments,

 which has long been known from contemporary Neutral, Petun, and

 Huron archaeological sites in Ontario, particularly in ossuaries, provides

 striking evidence of this ancient trade. The archaeological data dem-

 onstrate a vast increase in the marine shell traded into southern Ontario

 between 1600 and 1620.

 By 1627 there had been a major change in the nature of Massawomeck/

 Antouhonoron activity in the Chesapeake Bay region. No longer were

 they marauders periodically pillaging Susquehannock and tidewater Al-

 gonquian villages in search of European goods. Around 1627 they had

 successfully completed a punitive attack on the Conoy Piscataway band

 on the Potomac River and established suzerainty over the Anacostank

 pressing them into service to convey them ". . . all such English truck

 as commeth into the [Potomac] river." Later in 1632 the Massawomeck/

 Antouhonoron met Virginian fur traders at the Great Falls on the Po-

 tomac where they negotiated a trading arrangement with the English

 which bypassed their Anacostank middlemen.

 By 1632, possibly as early as 1627 but after 1622 when the Virginian

 fur trade on the Potomac river was confined to the "non-beaver" In-

 dians, the Massawomeck/Antouhonoron had moved from their home-

 land in the Niagara region to a hinterland Appalachian location west of

 Chesapeake Bay from which they were better able to conduct their fur

 trade on the Potomac with the Jamestown settlers. The alliance between

 the Antouhonoron and the Iroquois noted by Champlain to be in effect

 ca. 1615 had ceased to exist before ca. 1627 and new hostilities forced

 them to move from their Niagara region homeland. Their move closer

 to Chesapeake Bay reflects, in part, their desire to exploit their earlier

 ability to obtain European material in this region. There is no evidence

 that they continued to trade marine shell from the Tangier Sound region

 after they moved to this hinterland. The hostilities which forced the

 Antouhonoron/Massawomeck from the region between lakes Erie and

 Ontario east of the Niagara River prior to 1627 may be a harbinger of

 the unrest in that region which later caused the Wenro to move to Hu-

 ronia before 1638 and the Kahkwas and Erie to be destroyed.

 An English eyewitness account of the Massawomeck/Antouhonoron

 homeland west of Chesapeake Bay indicates they were a populous "na-

 tion" said to number some 30,000, significantly more than the 5,000 ti-

 dewater Algonquians estimated by Smith in 1608. They were ruled by

 four kings1 who were allied in some manner as a "confederate nation."

 l Smith indicates on his Virginia map of 1612 (Fig. 1) the Massawomecke had three

 "kings" houses, presumably one in each of their principal villages. Champlain records in
 the legend to his 1632 map that the Antouhonoron had fifteen villages (Biggar 1936 (6):
 249). In both instances this information was derived from Indian accounts and reflects the
 situation in their homeland in the Niagara region. In 1632 Edward Fleet's eyewitness
 account of the Massawomeck homeland in the Chesapeake Bay hinterland states there
 were four kings and he names the four principal villages in which they resided. Fleet also
 states that he visited thirty large Massawomeck villages (Neill 1876: 27-28), although that
 seems incredible in view of his short stay with the Massawomeck.

 Lacking additional information in this regard, and taking these estimates at face value,
 it does not seem credible to attribute this significant increase in population over a twenty-

 dd year period to an explosion in the Massawomeck birth-rate. On the contrary it seems
 Likely that, apart from whatever misfortunes they might have encountered, the hostilities
 which drove the Massawomeck from their homeland in the Niagara region would result
 .n a population decrease. Possibly the apparent population increase took place when an

 innamed group allied with the Massawomeck in the hostilities mentioned, joined them

 when they were forced from the Niagara region. Possibly other groups along the way,
 anticipating attack since the Massawomeck had decamped, joined them. Possibly a group
 indigenous to the new Massawomeck homeland west of Chesapeake Bay was adopted by
 the Massawomeck. Possibly all three of these eventualities took place. There is evidence
 of language dissimilarities among the Massawomeck Fleet traded with at Great Falls in
 -1632 (see n. 3 below). Nevertheless, this upheaval could conceivably have resulted in a
 change in the Massawomeck political structure which is reflected in an increase of their
 'kings' from three to four.

 72 THE MASSAWOMECK

 Their principal towns were Tonhoga (Tohoga), Mosticum, Shaunetowa, and

 Usserahak; and their four kings also bore these names.2 In 1632 by an

 eyewitness account there were thirty 'towns' one of which allegedly

 contained 300 houses. These towns were palisaded with ". . . great trees

 and with scaffolds upon the walls." The Algonquians claimed the Mas-

 sawomeck were cannibals. It is possible there were language differences
 between the four Massawomeck/Antouhonoron "kingdoms."3

 In 1632 Massawomeck/Antouhonoron were neighbors of the Hereck-

 eene Erie who lived three days' journey beyond them, probably to the

 north. At that time the Hereckeenes and the Massawomeck/Antouhon-

 oron were not openly hostile but neither were they friends or allies.

 This was, in part, a result of their direct competition for the European

 goods the English were introducing into the fur trade on the Potomac

 River at that time.

 In 1634 the Marylanders commenced trading with the Massawomeck

 on the Potomac River. Although they appear in several locations on

 various maps as late as the Delisle map of ca. 1700, Leonard Calvert's

 description of the Maryland fur trade in 1634 provides the last contem-

 porary documentary reference to these people. John Lederer provides

 the last seventeenth-century reference when, in the region beyond the

 mountains at the headwaters of the Rappahonock River, he notes on

 his map of 1672, "The Massawomecks dwelt heretofore beyond these

 mountains."

 Thereafter there is silence.

 2 It is not certain how much the words for these Iroquoian cheftain names/locations have

 been altered as a result of Fleet's association with the Potomac River Algonquians and his
 use of Algonquian interpreters.

 3 On one occasion while trading with the Massawomeck at Great Falls, Fleet met an
 Indian with "a strange kind of behaviour, using some few words which I learned, but to
 me it was a foreign language." Later this man returned with a group of Usserahak Mas-
 sawomeck with whom Fleet was able to converse (Neill 1876: 29). Apart from the likelihood
 of his being Iroquoian, the identity of this foreigner remains unknown.

 VII. CONCLUSION

 Barring the revelation of heretofore unavailable primary or contem-

 porary documentation regarding the Massawomeck/Antouhonoron,

 problem-oriented archaeology appears to offer the most realistic op-

 portunity to confirm or deny this hypothesis and to test this model. At

 present the archaeological data available regarding the period ca. A.D.

 1600-1634 for the regions in which the Massawomeck and Antouhon-

 oron are alleged to have resided are not of the nature required to permit

 the examination of the archaeological reality in this context. Contem-

 porary sites in the Niagara region and in the areas at the headwaters of

 the Potomac, Monongahela, and Youghiogheny rivers will have to be

 located and examined in a manner likely to illuminate the problem of

 Massawomeck/Antouhonoron identity before this archaeological poten-

 tial can be realized. In the meantime, while awaiting the revelation of

 additional contemporary documentary evidence or the emergence of

 cogent archaeological data, this hypothesis is proffered as a plausible

 explanation of the evidence extant.

 APPENDIX A

 THE LOCATION OF THE ANCHANACHUCK

 In his 1608 True Relation (Barbour 1969: 186) Smith recounts how late

 in 1607 Powhatan had told him that the Anchanachuck lived ".

 upon the same Sea [with] a mighty Nation called Pocoughtronack, a

 fierce nation that did eat men." This location was confirmed in general

 terms by the Powell and Todkill account in The Proceedings which relates

 how, during Smith's meeting with the Susquehannock chiefs in the

 Tockwogh village at the head of Chesapeake Bay in July 1608, the English

 heard ". . . many descriptions and discourses they made us of Atquan-

 ahucke, Massawomecke and other people, signifying they inhabit the

 river of Cannida and from the French have their hatchets and such tooles

 by trade . . ." (Barbour 1969: 408; Quinn 1979 (5): 323). As a result it

 was surmised that the location of the Massawomeck homeland might be-

 come more apparent if the Anchanachuck (Atquanahucke, Atquana-

 chukes) homeland were known.

 It is noteworthy that when Smith drew the Zunfiga sketch map (Fig.

 2), presumably in 1608, he omitted the Anchanachuck from this map in-

 dicating only the Pocoughtawonauck on the inland "sea." This does not

 appear to be an oversight, for on his 1612 work Map of Virginia (Fig. 1),

 once again he located only the Massawomeck on this hinterland body
 of water. The omission of the Atquanahuck from both these maps appears

 to reflect information revealed in September 1608 when in a confron-

 tation with Powhatan, Powhatan put Smith right informing him ". . .

 as for the Ataquanuchuck [sic]. . . it is a contrary way from those parts

 you suppose it" (Barbour 1969: 414). However, there must have been

 more to this exchange, or some subsequent discussion regarding the

 location of the Atquanahucke, for in his General Historie (1624: 61) Smith

 appends the following contradictory illuminating comment to the Powell

 and Todkill account of Smith's meeting with the Susqusahonockes in

 the Tockwogh village: ". . . but the Atquanachucke are on the Ocean

 sea."

 Smith's Map of Virginia reflects this revision to the Powell and Todkill

 text. He locates the Atquanachukes (sic) on the Atlantic Ocean to the north

 of the head of Chesapeake Bay. However, the location of the crosses
 shown on this map at the head of Chesapeake Bay, short of the territory

 Smith attributes to the Atquanachukes, clearly indicates his intelligence
 was had by information of the Savages. ." (Barbour 1969: 344;

 LOCATION OF THE ANCHANACHUCK 75

 Wright and Freund 1953: 50). Thereafter the Atquanahucke, in one spelling

 or another, appear in a location on, or near, Delaware Bay as is evidenced

 by the Hall map of 1632 (Cumming et al. 1971: 283), the Blaue map of

 1635 (ibid.: 293), Barbour's map (1969: 169), and Mooney's account in

 tiodge's Handbook (1907 (1): 112). This location accords well with Took-

 Er's (1894: 183) interpretation of the Algonquian Atquanahucke as mean-

 ing "those beyond, or at the end of, the mountains."

 As finally and correctly located on the Delaware in the region below

 Fpresent-day New Castle, Delaware, the Anchanachuck are remote from
 the Massawomeck on the "river of Cannida" and the erroneous Powell

 and Todkill account of the Anchanachuk homeland can provide no as-

 sistance in the search for the Massawomeck homeland.

 APPENDIX B

 THE LOCATION OF OCANAHONAN

 A ccounts of Ocanahonan indicating that it was located on or near

 the "back sea" beyond or in the hinterland mountains are dou-

 bly involved in the search for the Massawomeck homeland.

 Should the Massawomeck and Ocanahonon have been neighbors, the

 successful location of Ocanahonan might help locate the Massawomeck

 homeland. Ocanahonan, being the location of Europeans in the hinter-

 land may have served, in some manner, as a source of the European

 material which the Tockwogh and Susquehannock claimed the Mas-

 sawomeck to have obtained from the French on the "river of Cannida."

 Late in 1607 Powhatan related to Smith that men clothed like him

 (Smith) lived at a place called Ocanahonan on "the course of our river,"

 the James River. In his 1608 True Relation Smith indicates that this lo-

 cation was beyond the falls at present-day Richmond, Virginia, but

 "within four or five daies journey of the falls" where there "was a great

 turning of salt water" (Barbour 1969: 182). It was in this context that

 Powhatan explained to Smith: "Beyond them [the Massawomeck] he

 [Powhatan] described [to Smith] people with short Coates, and Sleeves

 to the Elbowes, that passed that way in Shippes like ours. Many King-

 domes hee described mee the heade of the [Chesapeake] Bay, which

 seemed to be a mightie River, issuing from mightie Mountains betwixt

 the two Seas, the people cloathed at Ocamahowan" [sic] (Tyler 1907:

 45-46; Barbour 1969: 186).1

 1 In 1622 Edward Waterhouse (1622: 8-9) described an event experienced by a party of

 Englishmen who by that date, Waterhouse states, were "planted" at Great Falls. Although
 not wholly germane in the context of this paper, it is sufficiently reminiscent of accounts
 purporting Europeans to be west of "Virginia," to warrant inclusion here. ". . . in a
 voyage made by Lieutenant Marmaduke Parkinson, and other English Gentlemen, up the
 River of Potomack that saw a China Boxe at one of the Kings houses where they were:
 Being demanded where he had it, made answer. That it was sent from a King that dwelt
 in the West, over the great Hills, some tenne dayes iourney whose Countrey is near a
 great sea, he having that boxe, from a people as he said, that came thither in ships, that
 weare cloaths, crooked swords, & somewhat like our men, dwelt in houses, and were
 called Acanack-Chinas and he offered our people, that he would send his Brother along
 with them to that King, which offer the Governor purposed not to refuse; and the rather,
 by reason of the continual constant relations of all those Savages in Virginia, of a Sea, and

 least whereof is greater than the River of Thames, an navigable above an hundred and
 fifty miles, and not above sixe or eight miles one from another) which fall all into one

 LOCATION OF OCANAHONAN 77

 In his True Relation Smith also explains that "divers Indians" and
 "many of the rest not only Opechancanoyes [Powhatan's brother] and
 an Indian which had beene prisoner to Pehatan [sic] had before tolde
 mee" confirmed this location for Ocanahonan (ibid.).

 The location of Ocanahonan as expressed in days travel is varied and

 uncertain because the points of origin are not clear. In Smith's True

 Relation it was within four to five days' journey from the falls at present-
 day Richmond. Cogently Barbour notes the presence of an ink amend-

 ment to a manuscript copy to True Relation, which had been inserted

 before 1630. It reads "as of certaine men at a place 6 dayes iorny beyond

 Ocanahonan" (Barbour 1969: 182, n 2). Smith also notes in his True Re-
 lation that ". . . some called it five dayes, some sixe, some eight, where
 the sayde water dashed against many stones and rockes" on the back

 sea (ibid.: 186). In his General Historie (1624: 110) Smith states Ocanahonan
 was "five daies iourney from us," presumably from Jamestown. Sig-
 nificantly the accounts of three voyages to the falls at Richmond, made

 by Captain Newport, Gabriel Archer, and two unknown voyagers in
 search of the source of the James River, make no mention of Ocanahonan
 (Barbour 1969: 80-98, 102) which allegedly lay the various distances

 noted above beyond Richmond.

 In his Historie William Strachey mentions Ochanahoen (sic) in a wholly

 different context. In his description of the people who live beyond the

 hinterland mountains Strachey states: ". . . to the Southward where at
 Peccarecanick [Pakerakanick on the Zunfiga map of 1608] and Ochanahoen

 by the relation of Machumps [a Powhatan Indian who had been to Eng-

 land] the people have houses build of stone walls, and one storey above

 another so taught them by the English who escaped the slaughter at
 Roanoke." (Wright and Freund 1953: 34). A note on the Zuiiniga map

 states that four Roanoke survivors lived at this Pakerakanick location (Bar-

 bour 1969: 240, 264).

 The instructions provided for Sir Thomas Gates in anticipation of his

 becoming governor at Jamestown also mentions Ocanahonan in a context

 which place it south of Jamestown. Confused as Gates's instructions are
 at times, they clearly state: "Four dayes Journey from your forte [James-

 town] Southward is a town called Ohonahorn [sic] seated where the River

 of Choanoke [Chowan] divideth it self into three branches and falleth

 into the sea of Rawnoke [Albemarle Sound]" (Barbour 1969: 264).

 This location is alleged to be some twenty miles from Caththega (sic).

 Barbour (ibid.: 182, 264) notes that the amended True Relation manuscript

 in the British Museum also corrects the spelling of Ohohahorn in the

 and North: whereby they doubt not but to find a safe, easie, and good passage to the
 South Sea, part by water, and part by land, esteeming it not above an hundred and fifty
 miles from the head of the Falls [Great Falls], where we are now planted, the Discovery
 whereof will bring forth a most rich trade to Cathay, China, lapan, and those other of the
 East Indies, to the inestimable benefit of this Kingdome."

 manuscript to read "onahawan" and suggests that Caththega may be the

 Cataking shown on the Chowan River on the Velasco map of 1610 or

 1611 (Cumming et al. 1971; 266-67; Quinn 1979 (5): fig. 140).

 If Ocanahonan was south of Jamestown, the possibility arises that it

 may be Lane's Oanoke, or Ohanoke, the Choanoke village visited by Lane

 from the Roanoke settlement in the spring of 1586 (Quinn 1955 (1): 259;

 1979 (3): 296). There Lane heard how a powerful chief to the north,

 which was probably Powhatan, had ". . . traffike with white men who

 have clothes as we have." It seems likely that Lane's remarks refer to

 trade late in the sixteenth century between Powhatan and the Europeans

 who had frequented Chesapeake Bay before 1586, the ill-fated Jesuit

 mission at Axacan in 1570 being but one example. Nevertheless as Bar-

 bour has noted (1969: 240), neither Oconohowan, in any of its various

 spellings, or Pakerakanick are mentioned in the accounts of the Roanoke

 colony.

 These confusing accounts, and the speculation they have generated

 regarding Ocanahouan, appear to be laid to rest by a tangential remark

 made in 1611 by Sir Thomas Dale, then Marshall of Virginia: ". . . this

 summer Cole and Kitchins plot with three more [deserters] binding their

 course to Ocanohowan five daies journey from us [where] they report the

 Spanish inhabiting" (Arber 1884: 508). This places Ocanahowan on the

 Atlantic coast five days journey south of Chesapeake Bay in a region

 where the Spanish were active, remote from the homeland of the Mas-

 sawomeck located by Smith on a hinterland sea in the Chesapeake Bay

 latitudes. However, modern scholars are not all agreed on the location

 proposed by Sir Thomas. Quinn (1973: 459; 1985: 371) has suggested

 that the Europeans at Ocamahowan (sic) may be either the French on the

 St. Lawrence River or a village on the Roanoke River.
