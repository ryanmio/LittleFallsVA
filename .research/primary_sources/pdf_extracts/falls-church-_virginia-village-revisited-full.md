A VIRGINIA VILLAGE REVISITED

I

Falls Church: A virgivia Vi[hge Revisited

presents in words and pictures the roots and
branches of the history of a closely knit V:r-;n:a

community.

Buffalo trails and Indian paths had been

established and land grants and patents were

taken  up by English col ` '-:n+a   Tt  iQ a cherished

local tradition that a log cabin woo .

large chimneys on one of which a stone was

inscribed "1699." This is the date the Falls

Church community traditionally accepts for its

first settlement. A few years later, the Truro Parish

vestry directed that an Anglican church be built
"at the cross roads near Michael Rcagan's," in

1733. This was the important center for a hamlet

which became the postal village of Falls Church

in  1849, a chartered town of the same name in

1875  and a city of the second class in  1948.

The wooden structure of the first church

"near the falls" was completed in  1734 and was

replaced by a sturdy brick building in  1769, both

named "The Falls Church" after an important

geographical feature nearby, the Little Falls of the
Potomac River. Church vestrymen of different

times included prominent people like Augustine

Washington, George Mason, William Fairfax and

George Washington.

When war with Great Britain became

inevitable in  1776, recruiting was done at The

Falls Church for men to fight in the American

Revolution for independence from the mother

country. Old tobacco rolling roads became useful

for transporting corn, wheat and other crops for

export from the international port of Alexandria.

Turnpikes, canals, the Alexandria, Loudoun 8c

Hampshire Railroad and later electric trolleys

were built to provide better means of transporta-

tion.

Telegraph and telephone lines were strung to

improve communications.

The War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish

American War and World Wars I and 11 each had

specific impacts on the small community which

are herein described. Some of the personal letters

quoted have not been previously published.

Everyday life and the resourceful ways in

which civic-minded and well-motivated residents

coped with ever-present problems make for

informative and sometimes amusing reading.

Through text, captions and more than 275

pictures, some in color and many never before

published, a large portrait of people, places,
events and things is painted. The book's narrative

reveals the community's long-standing major con-

cern about providing good schools for the chil-

drcn of the village. Political and racial issues are

presented as well as subjects such as businesses,
community activities, religion, recreation, parks

and historic preservation.

e are standing at a crossroads in time and in history. We give thanks
tr living in a peaceful, free, and prosperous City. We know that it
Les everyone to make a little City such as Falls Church work-there
are no divisions between the government, the people, and business-we are
all part of the same civic ecosystem. It works because we work together to
make it work.

:`:`;

The "we" are our citizens-all of us-men and women of many races,
nationalities and religions. The "we" are their elected, employed, and volunteer

civil servants. The "we" are our businesses who not only serve their customers
but who also freely put so much back into our community. The "we" are the

people about whom this book is written.

In Falls Church at the threshold of the new millennium, we celebrate a

particularly rich heritage. Native Americans roamed the area, followed by
European settlers who moved here in  1699 and were the outermost edge of
Western civilization.  Soon they built The Falls Church. Later, troops marched
through here on Braddock's Expedition.

Our local leaders, including George Washington and George Mason, made

a revolution and established the framework for the most free nation on earth.
One of the corner stones-the Declaration of Independence-was first read in
the area at The Falls Church. And it was to here that the leaders of the country
fled when invaders occupied Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.

Later, the great commanders of the Civil War were here, as were thousands

of Federal and Confederate troops who moved through or were based in Falls
Church and in the forts on the surrounding hills.  During the Spanish-
American War we were again a major base of operations.

Some of our local citizens were leaders in the fight for equal rights early in

this century. During World War 11, Dwight Eisenhower lived here as he

planned the war effort. Before and since, our veterans and public servants have
sacrificed to carry on this heritage. The story of these events told in this book is
not just the history of Falls Church but of America.

Now, we are part of the most diverse, educated, economically successful,

technologically advanced, compassionate, free and influential region in the
world. That is a lot to celebrate and a lot to dedicate ourselves to maintaining
in the future. This book will help us do both.

Church resident. But our mirror may also be said to begin much earlier,
with Captain John Smith's map of the Potomac River basin of 1608.
A glance at Smith's map reveals a world much different from our own in
which a different civilization, with different villages, towns, and place names
occupied our region.

Pictures never lie, goes the old saying, but they alone do not illustrate

history. Falls Church is uniquely blessed to have excellent cartographic cover-

age, and we have included several of the most useful maps here.  Gifted artists
with brush and pen have created depictions of people, places, and local events
especially prior to the advent of photography. Selections from such works
are included.

Falls Church's photographic history reflects that of the medium. Early
Falls Church inhabitants appear grim: limited technology required lengthy

exposures in which the subjects remained absolutely still.  Smiles were difflcult
to hold and teeth were often unsightly (smiling in photographs is a twentieth-
century convention).

Indoor photos became common in Falls Church after the invention of
magnesium flash lighting in  1878.  George Eastman revolutionized photogra-

phy in  1888 by marketing his Kodak camera, which made "snapshots," or
casual photography, the realm of the common man. Photography in Falls
Church grew by leaps and bounds after this date.

Maurice Terman, chair, and members also provided guidance when requested
by the authors.

Tricentennial Committee Chair Ben Birindelli and committee members
were encouraging to the authors and asked good questions which led to helpful
research and answers. Many answers came from the Virginia Room staffs at
Fairfax and Arlington Public Libraries. Staff of the Local History Room of the
Mary RIley Styles Public Library of Falls Church also remained cheerful, will-
ing, and resourceful in repeated searches for different reference materials and

graphics. Janet Daeger-Warden, Beverly Rausch, and Brenda Crowley are pleas-
ant people with whom to work. Deane Dierksen, former library director, gave
the authors the beneflt of her knowledge, loan of computers, and constructive
comments after a careful reading of the manuscript draft. Additional readers
included Benson and Nancy Birindelli, Janet Daeger-Warden, Carol DeLong,

Jane Dexter, David Eckert, Edna Frady, Edwin Henderson 11, John Maier,
Diane Morse, Ross Netherton, David Snyder, Maurice Terman, Keith
Thurston, Adelaide Wang, and Harry Wells.

When a pictorial publication is involved, good photographs are a vital part

of the plan and in addition to the fine professional work of william Edmund
Barrett and Quentin Porter and the extensive Falls Church library photo collec-
tion, we had help from Barry Buschow, Dr. Frank D'Aquila, Maureen Budetti,
Howard Herman, John Maier, Scott Boatright, and many others whose credits
are shown with their photos. Tony Chaves supplied some early Falls Church
images from his extensive postcard collection.

City staff members who assisted us in various ways were City Attorney Roy

8. Thorpe, Jr., City Clerks Elizabeth-Anne Shawen and Kathleen Buschow,
Environmental Services Manager Son H. Nguyen, former City Manager Harry
E. Wells, Patsy Mitchell, staff, Falls Church Post Office; and Communications
Director Sheila Graham assisted with their specialties.

Many writing projects would not be successfully completed without the

people who take care of the all-important mechanics of getting through the
publication process.  Bernie Walton was the representative for publisher
Donning in Virginia Beach and worked as coordinator of the project with the
authors and the Tricentennial Committee in Falls Church. Matthew 8.
Gilmore and Margaretha Backers-Netherton did yeoman service assisting with
the proofreading of thousands of words. Carol and David Dunlap did much of
the preparation of the computer disks for splicing the different parts of the
work together. Finally to RIchard Colvin for his help with the indexing.

Introduction

ty of Falls Church, those exploring its history must first understand those
forming elements.

Falls Church is located in the Northern Virginia Piedmont region. The
underlying intensely folded rocks of the area were formed over 500 million

years ago. They were forcibly intruded by molten rock between 250400 mil-
lion years ago. The ground level was later uplifted and then eroded by wind
and water when Falls Church was a flat alluvial terrace under a wide, shallow
river draining from the western mountain range. River rock was deposited on
the ground that is now between 400-450 feet above sea level.  Following the
demise of the river, continued erosion formed winding, narrow, flat-bottomed
valleys, punctuated by river rock and gravel-capped hills. These hills and valleys
continue to exist today. Until recent decades, these valleys were referred to as
"hollows."

Two main streams, Tripps Run and Four Mile Run, have spring-fed sources

just outside of the City of Falls Church boundaries. The streams flow toward
the southeast into the Potomac River. They are separated by a ridge that rises
to 350450 feet above sea level, extending from Mount Daniel to Taylor Hill.
Tripps Run is bordered by a second higher ridge, to the southwest locally
known as Prout Hill, and also known as "Horseshoe Hill."

By the end of the Ice Age, this attractive landscape was characterized by
deep weathering and fertile black soil covered by game-rich forests and flsh-

filled streams.1

While there is little left in Falls Church to remind us of the game-rich for-
est and fish-filled streams, a very small woods on Taylor Hill next to Oakwood
Cemetery at Seven Corners prevails. The woods provide a diversity of natural-
ly-occurring native Virginia trees, shrubs, and vines, growing in soil undis-
turbed for over  140 years. The central portion of the woods is the last undis-
turbed area in Falls Church that has not been infested by exotic, invasive plants
which crowd out the native understory plants critical to the survival of our
native songbirds, butterflies, and other wildlife that have evolved in this area
over thousands of years.2

Based on a.rchaeological discoveries, at least 8,000 years ago Native

Americans would gather with their families in small groups beside local streams
and establish winter camps from which the men and boys would go on hunt-
ing expeditions. Several projectile points, used for spears or arrows, have been
found in recent times beside Tripps Run near Sisler's quarry and on Four Mile
Run, near the East Falls Church Metro station.3

Captain John Smith was the flrst European explorer who left a written
record of flora, fauna, and the native people when he explored the Chesapeake
Bay area and the Potomac River in  1608. His book on the subject was pub-

lished in  1624.

Prince Charles of England, later Charles 11, granted to loyal followers in
1649 over 5,000,000 acres of land between the Rappahannock and Potomac
Rivers and designa.ted it as the Northern Neck Proprietary. This included terri-
tory later to become Fairfax County and still later, Falls Church.

As English settlement of the area began in the late  1600s, county govern-
ments were gradually created along with Anglican parishes to administer civic
and religious life under the established Church of England.  Before Fair fax
County was created, Truro Parish was established in what was then Prince
William County. The parish vestry ordered at a meeting on March 26,1733,
the construction of The Falls Church, later named after the nearby Little Falls
of the Potomac River. It was a wooden frame building completed "at the Cross
Roads near Michael Reagans" in  1734.4

Fairfax County was established in  1742, but it was more than  100 years
later that the Falls Church postal village was designated. This resulted from the

growth of the settlement which included the immigration of northerners. The
road system between Leesburg and Alexandria had been improved when the
Middle Turnpike, now Leesburg Pike, was completed in  1839.

Following the Civil War, railroads, which had been built by 1860, electric

trolleys, telegraph, telephones, electric power service, and other transportation
and communication improvements made Falls Church a desirable place in
which to live.

Village leaders eventually requested a town charter from the General
Assembly. This was approved in  1875. Shortly thereafter a large public school
was built to educate the children of the community. At the beginning of the
twentieth century, in  1900, the population of the town was  1,007. By 1990,
the city's population was 9,522.  Proximity to the Federal Government and the

growth of the nation's capital in Washington, D.C. had profound
influences on the growth of. Falls Church, which became a city of the second

class in  1948.

Falls Church is located in the northeastern corner of virginia in the

Tidewater-Piedmont transition zone of the Potomac River watershed.  It is
seven miles southeast of and across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.

The climate is moderate with an average annual temperature of 57.8

degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature in January is 35.2 degrees and the
average temperature in July is 78.9 degrees. The annual precipitation is 47
inches, eight inches of snow and 39 inches of rainfall.

The frost-free season lasts about 200 days each year, long enough for the

growth of a wide variety of garden vegetables, fruits, flowering trees, deciduous
and coniferous trees, shrubs, and plants. In winter, the ground is generally
frozen only to a shallow depth. There are several types of soils and topographi-

cal details with gently rolling hills and pleasant stream valleys.

Responsive local government, citizen involvement, an excellent public
school system, tree preservation and planting, and historic preservation are
major concerns of the Falls Church residents of today.

en English adventurers including Captain John Smith arrived in

the Virginia colony in  1607 and settled at Jamestown, they found them
selves among a politically complex group of semi-sedentary Algonquian-

speaking Powhatan Indians. These Native Americans were living in more than
thirty small chiefdoms or districts within a regional district called Chicacoan
in the Potomac River valley. I

The earliest known written account of the Indians of Northern Virginia,
their customs and the local flora and fauna was recorded by Captain Smith,
who with fourteen other Englishmen left Jamestown in  1608 to explore and
map the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. These streams included the
Potomac River, on which they steered their two-ton open barge to where the
boat could go no farther upstream to the Little Falls, referred to as "the head
of navigation.''2

Smith and others have recorded names of eleven different Indian nations
or groups living along the lower Potomac from its falls to its mouth on the bay.
On the left bank or eastern shore, the Maryland side of the river, were the
Nacotchtanks, Piscataways, Pamunkeys, Nanj emoys, Potapacos, and
Yaocomacos.  On the Virginia shore were the Tauxenents, Patawomekes,
Matchotics, Chicacoans, and Wicocomocos.3 These different native peoples
occupied the area and hunted, farmed, flshed, and fought in the region at
European contact time.4

At the head of navigation, where Pimmit Run flows into the Potomac
RIver, trader Henry Fleet exchanged goods with the Iroquois Indians from the
north about  1630. He recorded not only having observed the plentiful supply
of sturgeon which the natives caught at the Little Falls but also noted that "as
for deer, buffaloes, bears and turkeys, the woods do swarm with them and the

soil is extremely fertile .... ''5

As permanent settlement by European landowners began, large plantations

were first established at choice locations along the main rivers and navigable
tributary streams. Yeoman farmers obtained long-term leases from the
Northern Neck Proprietary which had been flrst granted in  1649 by Charles 11
of England. They grew tobacco, corn, and other crops on their small farms.6

One of these humble farmers perhaps built a log house with large brick
chimneys at the future site of Falls Church. No early deed or other documenta-
tion for that land exists nor is a surname known. A cherished local tradition
holds that a large stone set in one of two large chimneys was engraved with the
number "1699." The "Big Chimneys" house, near the current site of the Falls
Church Post Offlce, was demolished between  1908 and  1914.  It is on this leg-
end of the flrst establishment of a dwelling in the community in  1699 that the
observance of the 300th anniversary is based.7

Three well-traversed game and Indian trails gradually became main north-

13

south thoroughfares, one the Sugarlands Rolling Road (now
Route  193, the Georgetown Pike), the second, the Falls Rolling
Road (now Route  120, Glebe Road and Little Falls Road), and
third, what was later called the Alexandria Road by Vestal's Gap
in the Blue Ridge. The early road westward and south followed a
natural drainage ridge to Difficult Run and was chosen as an
avenue of immigration by the first English settlers, also becom-
ing a rolling road in  1732 when the Hunting Creek warehouse

was built.8

By 1730, Governor Sir William Gooch had already reported
that although tobacco was Virginia's largest cash crop, export of
wheat from the colony was between  10,000 and 20,000 bushels

per year and that the greatest part of that was exchanged for
rum, sugar, salt, and molasses brought to Virginia by ships from
New England and Bermuda.9

Two powerful colonial landed gentlemen, Robert "King"
Carter and Thomas Lee, planned to establish a tobacco ware-
house at the Little Falls as early as  1728. However, the ware-

house was not built until  1742.10

A tobacco warehouse was built in  1732 on Simon Pearson's land on the
upper side of Hunting Creek in what was then Prince William County. The
land and warehouse lay within new boundaries when Falrfax County was
organized ten years later, in  1742. It was at the site of this warehouse that the
Town of Alexandria was established in 1749, the first town in Falrfax County.
Tobacco rolling roads were so called because tobacco leaves were tightly packed
into round wooden casks or hogsheads and rolled to the marketplace. These
early roads were established from western and northern inland farms to towns
built on the navigable rivers. One such early thoroughfare from Leesburg east,
later known as the Middle or Leesburg Turnpike, passed through the center of
the Falls Church community on its way to Alexandria.11

property with social standing in their county and were by law responsible for
the administration of religion and the moral health of all people in the parish.
They had to provide a minister, build and maintain churches, provide for the

poor, the sick and orphans, make presentment to the County Court in adultery
cases, appoint processioners to establish boundaries of patented lands, and
levy a poll tax annually on all tithables to pay for the costs. When a parish was
organized, the first vestry was elected and from then on the group was self-

perpetuating for they filled vacancies with their own appointees.1

The definition of tithables (taxable individuals) included all white males
over  15, and all males and females over  15. All negroes under 15 were exempt.
So, too, were all white women and white girls, no matter what their age.2
The General Assembly passed an Act in  1732 directing that Hamilton
Parish in Prince William County be divided and a new Anglican parish called
"Truro" be organized to include all of Prince William north of the Occoquan

River and Bull Run and west to the Blue Ridge. Soon after Truro Parish was
established, a meeting was held at the home of william Gunnell on upper
Four Mile Run.  In March  1733, the vestry decided to construct "a church
at the cross roads near Michael Reagans." A purchase of two acres was made
later with 50 shillings to landowner John Trammell. This is where The Falls
Church has always stood; first as a wooden weather-boarded building designed
and built in  1734 by Richard Blackburn and then in  1769, as a brick church
designed and built by James Wren. The site was in Stafford County until  1730,
from  1730 to  1742 in Prince William County, from  1742 to  1948 in Fair fax
County, and from 1948 to the present, within the City of Falls Church.3
Truro Parish vestrymen played major roles in the early history of The

Gunnell, John West, Charles Broadwater, William Fair fax, George William
Fairfax, Augustine Washington, George Mason, George Washington, and

James Wren.4

The first levy laid for Truro Parish took place in  1733 and furnished a
flne example of life in a society where tobacco served as a medium of exchange.
To take care of financial needs for the coming year in the parish, the vestry
required 45,399 pounds of tobacco to be raised by collecting 67 pounds from

each of 681  tithables.5

When Thomas, Sixth Lord Fair fax came to the Virginia colony in  1735
to discover for himself the potential of his Northern Neck Proprietary, he was
favorably impressed. In order to determine the exact boundaries of the more
than 5,200,000 acres involved he engaged John Warmer in  1737 to survey the
boundary lines and prepare a map for consideration by the King's Council in
London. The Virginia colonial officials engaged surveyor William Mayo to

21

prepare a map as well. Ultimately, the Warner
map was chosen as the official document.6
One of the landowners who lived near
and attended The Falls Church was John Ball,
a yeoman farmer, who received a proprietary

grant in 1742 from Thomas, Sixth Lord
Fairfax. His house was built on a 166-acre

piece of land beside Four Mile Run, down-
stream from his local Anglican church which
had been built in  1734. According to architec-
tural historians, it was typical of an ordinary

yeoman farmer's dwelling in the vicinity of
The Falls Church at the time. Made of simple
log construction, it has a clapboard roof. The
dwelling exists today in Glencarlyn having sur-
vived for more than 250 years.7

John Ball, his wife Elizabeth and their five

daughters all lived in this little house. County
court records made after John Ball's death in
1766 indicate that he and his family had
everything they needed to live a full life: axes
to cut down the trees and clear the land; tools

with which to build his house; and tools with which to make furniture. He had
cows for milk, cream, and beef; pigs for pork and bacon; sheep for food and
wool for clothes; geese for feathers for his beds; and bees for honey for his
bread. He owned a mill to grind his wheat and corn; he had a distillery for
strong drink; and a mare for transportation and plowing. He had guns for
hunting and protection; tools to tend and cultivate his land; linen and wooden
wheels for spinning; bed hides for warmth; earthen and wooden ware for din-
ing; cooking utensils; knives and forks. An iron and a looking glass were listed.
And after a day's work, he had his books, spectacles and even a fiddle for enter-
tainment.8 He was a well-documented example of a successful farmer who lived
near The Falls Church in the mid-1700s.

During the French and Indian War (1755-1763), a force under the com-
mand of British Major General Edward Braddock was sent against the French
in America at the forks of the Ohio River. Landing at the port of Alexandria,
troops, artillery and heavy baggage were gradually moved overland up the
Virginia and Maryland sides of the Potomac River to Fort Cumberland and
then west toward Fort Duquesne and what was to be a major defeat.9

British Deputy Quarter Master General Sir John St.  Clair had been
assigned the task of clearing or building the necessary roads to Fort Duquesne
and constructing boats that would be needed by the troops to cross streams
and rivers along the way. After a thorough inspection of the routes beginning
in January of 1755, St. Clair wrote describing the local roads at the time
as: Williamsburg to Fredericksburg, very good; Fredericksburg to Winchester,
very bad; and Winchester to Wills Creek, "85 miles of the worst road I ever

travelled."10

Troops both British and American assembled at Alexandria for the arduous

journey, most of them on foot. On April 7,1755, three companies of virginia
Rangers left Alexandria for Wills Creek via Winchester. Sir Peter Halkett's
Regiment of Foot (about 500 men) left camp at Alexandria on their way to
Winchester and Fort Cumberland using the road past the country lane to John
Ball's house and past The Falls Church. With the soldiers were marching

drummers, horsemen, cannons on wheels, wagons carrying tents, baggage, regi-
mental provisions, arms and ammunition. The sounds of many tramping feet
and loud voices; horses with their squeaking leather harnesses; creaking loaded
covered wagons; rumbling cannon gun carriages and colorful flags snapping in
the breezes were virtually unknown noises for the sparsely-settled farm families
who lived along the way.1l

On this military expedition was one Madame Charlotte Browne, a wid-

owed Englishwoman who was serving as a matron of nurses. She left
Alexandria with a convoy on its way to Winchester on June  1,  1755. Twelve
wagons and forty guards were in the group. They traveled past The Falls
Church and stayed overnight at the Old Court House (near Tysons Corner).
She commented in her diary entry the next morning, after bumping along
in a wagon all the previous day: "The Roads were so Bad that I am almost

disjointed."12

One result of this major colonial event was that the thoroughfare the mili-

tary used (now Route 7, Broad Street) was called "Braddock's Road" in the
community surrounding The Falls Church until the time of the Civil War-
more than  100 years.13

In February 1765, the House of Burgesses established a new parish-
Fair fax-out of part of the old parish-Truro. The very next year, a levy was
laid for the building of two brick churches, one "where the old Falls Church
stands and the other at Alexandria [now Christ Church] , the undertakers to
meet at The Falls Church and bring in their plans."14 James Wren produced a

plan which was chosen for both The Falls Church and the church at
Alexandria. He had just been appointed a vestryman "in place of Edward
Blackburn resigned."15 James Wren  (c.1728-1815)  proved to be an important
man of the crossroads community which he served well. Not only was he an
architect, builder, and a vestryman, but a

planter and farmer, a court justice, sher-
iff, county official, and finally, an

innkeeper.16

Population was steadily growing in

Fair fax County, especially around
Alexandria, and there was local demand
for a separate parish. After some disagree-
ments, the House of Burgesses reached a
consensus and in May 1765, a boundary
was deflned between Truro Parish and the
new Fairfax Parish in whose territory The
Falls Church was now located. Being in
bad repair, the old Truro Parish had
already directed in  1765 that the wooden
building be replaced with a new brick
ediflce. While the new brick church was
under construction between  1767 and
1769, the decaying wooden building was
the scene of antisocial behavior by one John Hirst, Jr., who was later presented
by the grand jury "for behaving in an indecent manner on Sunday the 17th
instant at The Falls Church by bringing a mare to his stallion in presence of

part of the Congregation in time of service." He was fined for this misdeed.17
Finally the beautiful brick church was finished. The Fairfax Parish vestry

agreed that James Wren had completed his work at the new Falls Church at
their vestry meeting held on December 20,  1769. Three months later, George

Drdujing of John Ball horyiesteed of 1767,

International events were soon to change life in the colonies and particu-

larly affect Falls Church vestrymen George Washington and George Mason.
After the British Parliament closed the Port of Boston on June  1,1774, Mason,
with the help of others, wrote the Fairfax Resolves which called for, among
other points, the need "to concert a general and uniform Plan for the Defense
and Preservation of our common Rights.''19

As war with Great Britain became a reality and recruitment of soldiers was
held at The Falls Church for service in that conflict, Milcah Trammell was laid
to rest in  1776. Her father had sold two acres of land to Truro Parish on which
the  1734 and  1769 church buildings had been erected. Milcah, youngest of

John and Susanna Trammell's seven children, had married wealthy Simon
Pearson, a union which had ended in divorce, a rare action in those times.20

A Vmar for hdependence

ernment. No fighting occurred in Northern Virginia and the war's effects on
Falls Church were incidental.  But the village may be justifiably proud of the
actions of the men representing it in the Colony's revolutionary councils.

After Bostonians threw tea into their harbor to preclude its taxation by
English authorities in  1773, Parliament in London enacted legislation pun-
ishing the colonies and demanding their obedience to policy. Virginia led
the resistance to this legislation when its House of Burgesses  (now the House
of Delegates), meeting in the royal capital, Williamsburg, declared a day
of fasting, prayer, and "humiliation." The Governor, John Murray, Fourth
Earl of Dunmore, dissolved the Burgesses, which promptly reconvened and
issued a call for the colonies to send deputies to a coordinating conference
in Philadelphia. Hostilities soon commenced in Massachusetts and then in
Virginia.  Governor Dunmore fled Williamsburg, and the philosophical

debates began.1

Key to these proceedings were the communications, called "resolves,"

from thirty-one of virginia's counties conveying the sense of their citizens to
the Colony's first revolutionary convention in  1774.  Of particular note are
the Fzzz.r/zz)c I?c:fo/âc'f. These resolves, written by George Mason of Fairfax
County, were the most proactive and far-ranging of any presented. There
were twenty-four separate resolutions each beginning with the single word,
"Resolved"; three called for a continental congress of deputies from each

colony to decide general policy toward Britain; war, if the Crown failed to
redress grievances and publication of the names of citizens not subscribing to

patriot views against England. These ideas proved influential in Virginia's rev-
olutionary conventions and in the Continental Congress. The Fzzz.7/zzx J?cj.a/âc+
were presented by George Washington of Mount Vernon and Col. Charles
Broadwater, of Falls Church.2

The Colony's last revolutionary council convened in Williamsburg from

May 6 through July 5,1776. On May 15  its members, including Col.
Broadwater and John West, Jr., unanimously instructed Virginia's delegates to
the Continental Congress to introduce a resolution calling for independence.
Richard Henry Lee of virginia did so on June 7. Congress passed the motion
on July 2 and two days later issued the Declaration of Independence, written
by Thomas Jefferson.3

George Mason, a Fairfax County delegate to the revolutionary conven-
tion, drafted the Virginia Declaration of Rights adopted by the convention
on June  12. This document, unmatched in its scope, guaranteed fundamen-
tal rights later repeated in the U.S. Bill of RIghts and French Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. These included freedom of religion,

27

freedom of the press, and the right to a jury trial by peers in both civil and

Criminal cases.4

Mason also drafted a constitution for Virginia, which was a novel "flrst"
for Englishmen anywhere who were not accustomed to a document deflning
and limiting the powers of government. Virginia's constitution, which declared
its independence from England, fashioned a republic and commonwealth-
a government of citizens united in their ideas of what constituted the common
âcÂ¢4 or good.5

George Washington remained a vestryman of his parish through the

Revolution, not resigning until  1784, although he was unable to attend to his

duties on the church vestry while leading American
armies afield. Revolutionaries from Falls Church
included Col. Broadwater, who recruited soldiers for
the local militia in The Falls Church; Col. James
Wren, Col. Charles Little, John Follin, and Charles

Simms.6

The Declaration of Independence, a copy of which
arrived over the post road from Philadelphia, was read
from the steps of The Falls Church sometime during
the summer of 1776, as it was at many churches dur-
ing those fateful days.7

A Federal Seat Of Goueruneut

wrote an Ordinance of Religious Freedom which was presented to the Virginia
legislature and failed to be adopted. In December of 1785, however, a similar
law was proposed by James Madison and was adopted as the Virginia Statute
for Religious Freedom in January 1786.  It was generally applicable but specifi-
cally abolished the Anglican Church which had been the official state church
in the Virginia colony. Later serving as a model for the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution, the statute declared that no man could be compelled
to attend or support any church nor suffer any discrimination because of his
religious beliefs. The Fairfax Parish vestry was represented at the First
Convention of the new Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia held at
Richmond in May 1785.1

Methodism in Northern Virginia had begun to win converts before  1776,

the year when the Fairfax Circuit was officially established at a Methodist
conference held in Baltimore. At first local church meetings were held at
"Church Hill," the home (now gone) of Col. and Mrs. William Adams at

present-day Seven Corners. Fair fax Chapel was built and probably dedicated
in  1779, located on the present-day site of Oakwood Cemetery. Itinerant
Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury recorded in his journal that he preached
at Fair fax Chapel in  1780. A year later Asbury recorded that he had preached
at the chapel again, followed by a black preacher, Harry Hoosier, speaking to
an interested white audience.

About  1798, the original wooden chapel building was replaced by a larger

brick building on one acre of land later given to the Methodist Society by the
descendants of Col. George Minor of "Minor's Hill." There was a gallery above
the entrance where the African-American people sat. This second building was
in use until the Civil War when Union troops destroyed it and used the bricks
to build chimneys for their winter quarters.2

The Methodist Historical Society of Northern Virginia placed a plaque in

Oakwood Cemetery in April  1969 commemorating the site of the first
Methodist church in Northern Virginia, Fair fax Chapel.3

After much discussion about various locations, Congress authorized the

establishment of the nation's ten-mile-square Federal District of Columbia on
the Potomac River in  1790. Necessary land was ceded by Maryland and
Virginia. Surveying of the territory took place in  1791  and  1792, forty bound-
any stones being set at approximately one-mile intervals. The work was done
under the supervision of Major Andrew Ellicott, assisted by gifted astronomer
Benjamin Banneker, a free black man.4

In  1980, the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service of the

Department of the Interior approved the naming of Southwest Boundary Stone
9, near Van Buren Street in Falls Church, after Benjamin Banneker to honor

31

his life and contributions. It was also

given the signiflcant major designation
as a National Historic Landmark.
The west cornerstone was sur-
rounded with a protective iron fence
by the Falls Church Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution
in  1952. Arlington County, Fair fax
County, and the City of Falls Church
established the surrounding park in
1956. The stone was placed on the
National Register of Historic Places in
1991. The Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors approved the naming of the

park after Andrew Ellicott in  1998. The
naming of the boundary stones after
Ellicott and Banneker was approved by
the Arlington County Board and the
Falls Church City Council in  1996.
The Banneker Park was publicly dedi-
cated on July  17,1999.5

passed Virginia land included the Town
of Alexandria, Fairfax County's seat of government. The County had therefore
to relocate their courthouse within the county boundaries. In  1798, the
4/exÂ¢72J7.z.a GÂ¢zc#g announced that the Fair fax County Courthouse commis-
sioners had selected the plan of architect James Wren for the new public
buildings. Wren owned and operated an ordinary (inn) at the time near the
brick Falls Church.6

The farm-to-market journey from the Shenandoah Valley, and Loudoun

and Fairfax counties was greatly improved by the first bridge built over the
Potomac River from the Virginia shore, at Little Falls. The covered wooden
bridge, called the Falls Bridge, was constructed by the Georgetown Bridge
Company in  1797. After this structure was washed away by high water, it
was replaced in  1810 with a higher stone chain suspension bridge-"Chain
Bridge.â7

After Thomas Jefferson was chosen president of the United States by the
House of Representatives in  1801, he experienced some difflculty in assem-
bling his small official family.8 Finally anticipating his arrival, Jefferson wrote
his Secretary of State, James Madison, on April 30 about the wretched road
conditions in Northern Virginia at the time. On the advice of col. James
Wren, Jefferson engaged two farmers to supply two horses to draw Madison's
carriage "up the Bull run hill .  .  . really the worst I ever saw in a public road."
The sitting president advised his colleague and friend, Madison: "You had bet-
ter start as soon as you can see to drive, breakfast at Col. Wren's, and come
here to dinner. We shall wait for you till 4 o'clock."9

The inn or tavern belonging to the gifted architect of Pohick Church,
Christ Church and The Falls Church and the new Fair fax County Courthouse
was a landmark in its time. On the map drawn in  1801  by Jonathon Lovett of
his survey of the roads between Winchestcr and Alexandria, he designated as
"Col. James Wren's" the location now known as Falls Church.10

The Tmar Of 1812
Gunpowder and lrtyugees

)mpanies found themselves victimized by an undeclared war upon the
high seas. Between  1792 and  1801  French ships captured at least twenty

Araf with Britain approached in 1812, Fair fax County shipping
Alexandria vessels. Until that point Virginians generally sided with the British
in their quarrels with other Europeans. After Britain began impressing
American seamen onto its ships at sea, local opinion shifted.

Until  1814 most of the fighting occurred far to the north of the mid-
Atlantic region and when the British threatened Washington, the federal gov-
ernment could not comprehend the scope of the danger.1  Most at fault was the
secretary of war, John Armstrong, who refused to believe the British would tar-

get Washington. Pandemonium ensued in the government and among citizens
as the British troops and fleet neared.2

Government offices evacuated their records across the river to Virginia on

or about August 23,  1814. Wagons for this effort were in short supply, howev-
er, as all able-bodied citizens were fleeing the city in wagons piled high with
their own personal goods. The scene was near bedlam in the city and on the

bridges leading to Virginia.3

Col.  George Minor and his 700-man Virginia Militia 60th Regiment were

summoned on August 23 from Falls Church, where they had mustered at
Wren's Tavern, to help protect Washington, but few came armed because an
attack was so unexpected. And due to bureaucratic bungling among war
department officials they were not sent to help defend the approaches to
Washington at Bladensburg.4

As conflicting reports reached Washington concerning the whereabouts of

the British troops, Commodore Thomas Tingey, commanding the Washington
Navy Yard, ordered his senior clerk, Mordecai Booth, to move the gunpowder
from the Yard's magazine to the interior of virginia. Booth, detailed to take the

powder to the farm of Sarah and Daniel Dulany, the commodore's daughter
and son-in-law at Falls Church, experienced great difflculty in flnding wagons
enough to accomplish this task. After crossing the Potomac bridge he encoun-
tered Col. Minor, who assigned a six-man guard to accompany him and his
cargo of explosives to Falls Church. Col. Minor and the rest of his regiment
hurried on to Washington, where they camped for the night in the Capitol.
Booth and his guard arrived at Wren's Tavern in Falls Church late on the night
of August 23, still one mile from the Dulany farm, and there spent the night.5

Before dawn news reached the tavern that American forces were abandon-

ing Washington to the British. Booth left for the Dulanys' farm at dawn, where
he found that 75 of 124 barrels and two quarter-casks of powder had been
unloaded and stored. The Dulanys' barn was woefully insecure, and Booth
went to the house of another local man, Dozier Bennett, with whom he
arranged to have a civilian guard posted at the barn until a Marine force could
arrive.  Booth then returned to the city.6

At the President's House (later the White House) the president's wife, Dolley

Madison, waited in vain for her husband's return. By mid-afternoon Mrs.
Madison wrote her sister, "Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect him! Two
messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly.... " She refused to leave until
the large portrait of George Washington was unscrewed from the wall, cut from
its frame and dispatched for safekeeping.  She then fled into Virginia, hoping to

join her husband, who, with most of his cabinet officials, dispersed to various

points.7

The roads between Falls Church and Washington were chaotic, disorderly,
and full of stragglers from Washington. Booth returned to the Navy Yard from
Falls Church to confer with officials and then rode out to determine the location
of the British troops. He soon collided with British redcoats, who had just
reached the District, and was fired upon. He fled back into the city, where he
found the Capitol deserted. Riding quickly to the President's House he discov-
ered it was dark, empty, and silent. A companion yanked violently on the front
door bell-pull, but no one was there to answer. Only then did Booth realize the

gravity of the situation: "the Metropolis of our Country was abandoned to its
horrid fate."8

Booth returned to the Capitol, where he was flred on again by the arriving
British, and then rode to the Navy Yard. Commodore Tingey, learning that the
enemy was in the city and unopposed, bade Booth farewell and torched the Yard.
It was twenty minutes past eight o'clock. In the Capitol the British Admiral
Martin Cockburn and his troops piled high the books and draperies and set them
afire. Booth, just reaching the Potomac bridge, looked back and saw the first
flames from the Navy Yard and the fort on Greenleaf's Point leaping into the sky.
By the time he ascended the hill on the Arlington end of the bridge the Capitol
was in flames.9

Booth stood on the hill with many other people, transflxed with horror by
the disaster unfolding before them. He reached Wren's Tavern in Falls Church at
midnight, where he found his family, escaped from Washington, waiting for him.
Everyone in the tavern was in a great state of excitement, and people and wagons
were passing constantly on the road outside (East Broad Street).1Â° President
Madison, the attorney general, and his entourage struggled through the crowded
oads toward Falls Church. Mrs. Madison, unable to make it that far in a heavy
rainstorm, stopped for the night at Rokeby, near Chain Bridge, the home of her
friend Mrs. Richard Love, northeast of Falls Church.11  From there Mrs. Madison
watched the flaring night sky. Her husband and his traveling companions
stopped frequently to turn back and look at the burning city. The conflagration
which was Washington-its burning ships, stores, homes, and public buildings-
could be seen as far away as Leesburg and Baltimore, where worried residents still
had no news of events. At daylight David Winchester of Baltimore wrote that no
one knew what had happened in Washington; "We only know from the light
during the night that the city was on fire."12 In the Falls Church area, from
which the burning city was clearly and distinctly visible, Miss Matilda Roberts, a
seven-year-old refugee from Alexandria who never forgot that night, was awak-
ened and taken outside to see Washington burn. "At first I thought the world was
on flre," she recounted later.  "Such a flame I have never seen since."13

Rumors bred in the chaos of that evening that slaves were revolting fright-

ened Mrs. Love into fleeing Rokeby at daylight for the interior of virginia. The
rumors grew in strength the further she went and so she turned and raced for
home. When her driver, a slave, remarked that he did not think the horses would
make it by nightfall, she feared he was part of the rebellion and decided to shoot
him if he stopped the wagon. He did not and they arrived to find that everyone

at Rokeby had fled to Falls Church, "where there was safety in
numbers." Mrs. Madison went to the home of Mrs. Minor,
outside Falls Church, where she stayed the next two nights
out of fear of the supposed rebellion.14

The next morning, August 25, Booth arose early at
Wren's Tavern in Falls Church and, taking the tavernkeeper's
son with him as guide, departed for Mrs. Minor's. There he was told President
Madison had stopped briefly the night before but was no longer there.  Booth
returned to Wren's, where he was met by Sergeant-Major Forrest with a guard
of about twenty-flve men and boys, there to guard the Navy's gunpowder, and
a troop of the Fair fax Dragoons. The presence of the explosive caused Falls
Church residents and the refugees they hosted great consternation, and they

petitioned Booth to remove the powder. This Booth agreed to do, and sent
scouts to locate a better storage spot four to six miles further inland. The scouts
failed to flnd any better location, and the powder remained stored in the

Dulanys'  barn.15

Returning to Wren's from the Dulany farm Booth discovered he had just
missed President Madison, who had stopped at the inn in search of his wife.
The president, whose movements were hampered first by reports that the
British were en route to seize him and then by reports of the slave insurrection,
eventually reunited with Mrs. Madison at Wiley's Tavern near Great Falls.16

0n August 29 the British fleet arrived off Alexandria, where panicked citi-
zens, the destruction of washington fresh on their minds, quickly surrendered
their city.  Booth rode to Alexandria from Falls Church, where he felt sickened
by the sight of the Union Jack flying above the District and the British fleet

plundering Alexandria. After sacking the port town's warehouses, the enemy
fleet moved downriver. The desperate Americans, in an ultimately vain attempt
to stop the fleet, set up large guns at the destroyed President's House (which
then had a seven-mile view downriver). Booth, galloping all the way to
Dulany's farm, dispatched two wagon-loads of powder to the President's
House. The powder was returned to Falls Church September 6 where it
remained until the  loth.17

Falls Church's proximity to Washington bound it inexplicably to the de-
fense of the capital. Future wars would follow in which this was also the case.

Internal Improuemeuts

I nineteenth century.

er-increasing transportation opportunities, and the economic and other

Eindfalls they created, were evident in Falls Church during most of the

Virginia law, following English precedent, required the citizens living
along its roadways to contribute work annually for their upkeep. This method
became less popular in Falls Church and elsewhere as growing commerce
increased wear a.nd tear on the roads. The merchants of Leesburg, the gateway
to the Shenandoah Valley, anxious to have a reliable connection with a market

port, established the Leesburg Turnpike Company in  1808. The company
built a road from Leesburg to Sugarland Run near Dranesville (at Route 7),
where it met a connector road financed by Georgetown-present route  193,
Georgetown Pike-connecting with Georgetown via the Chain Bridge. These
were completed about  1820.1

Georgetown and Alexandria were locked in competition for business from

the interior and from Baltimore and, when Georgetown's merchants fell on
hard times in the late  1820s, Alexandria's commercial leaders arranged for a
new, more direct link between their seaport town and Leesburg. These
arrangements culminated in  1829 in the Middle Turnpike Company, which
built a road from the eastern end of King Street along the colonial-era ridge
road through Falls Church, and on to connect with the Leesburg Turnpike at
Dranesville. Tolls were collected along this route beginning in about  1839.
The new road and the commerce it brought allowed Falls Church, long a
sleepy village,  to begin robust growth.2

Another new road which impacted Falls Church was one completed in
1852, linking the new Aqueduct Bridge across the Potomac with Fair fax Court
House. Its route between the bridge and Falls Church was, generally, that of
modern Wilson Boulevard.3

Falls Church's strength during these times was its location-a short day's
ride from Alexandria and Georgetown. Geography did not bless it with fast-
flowing water sufficient to power a milling industry, and area farmers did not

produce enough crops to export outside the local market, but Falls Church
was well positioned to provide services for travelers. As the roads improved and
commerce quickened the need for taverns and inns increased correspondingly.
By 1827 there were four in the area:  Gordon's near The Falls Church; Wren's,
between the church and modern Seven Corners; Minor's, at Seven Corners,
and Lindsay's (later MCTear's), west of the village on Pimmit Run. Wren's, in
business since at least  1785, was well-regarded and recommended by Thomas

Jefferson. It, as well as the other taverns, were social centers in which public
notices were posted, and official meetings and public sales of land and slaves
occurred. One historian called taverns such as these the "dominant public
spaces" of the era.  By present-day standards these inns offered crude lodging.
Travelers often shared beds and amenities were few. This changed as tra.velers
became more prosperous a.nd willing to pay for better services. The venerable

39

and long-lived Star Tavern, also located near
The Falls Church, joined local roadside hostel-
ries by mid-century.4

Better roads also offered greater convenience

to practice religious faith, and several churches
were added to the village by mid-century. Falls
Church was home to a vigorous Methodism as
early as  1774-the second such place in
Virginia, and one of the earliest in America. By
1780 the Falls Church Methodist meeting place
was called Fairfax Chapel. The first chapel, of
log and clapboard, was built in the late  1770s.
In Falls Church and throughout the former
colonies Methodism soon replaced Anglicanism
as the most popular faith, and the small chapel
was replaced in  1798 by a larger structure which
was, in turn, replaced by the last chapel, in what
is now Oakwood Cemetery, in early 1819.
Fair fax Chapel was the second church in the
area, after The Falls Church. Circuit riders
staffed the pulpit. The last Chapel, a substantial
building constructed of thick brick walls, was
forty-by-sixty feet in width and length, and
included a large gallery used for the "colored

people." This Chapel was dismantled by soldiers
during the Civil War who used its brick to build

Leesburg a,nd Alexandria Turnpike tollgate,

chimney flues in their encampments on the hills nearby.5

Presbyterianism was represented informally in the area beginning in  1812,

when a minister of that denomination began preaching occasionally in Falls
Church until his death in  1828. Presbyterian services were much more infre-

quent from  1828 until  1848, when regular preaching resumed in Falls Church
in the homes of various members. Services were interrupted by the Civil War
and did not resume until afterward.6

The Columbia Baptist Church congregation was established in  1856 and

built a wood-frame home with a steeple in  1857 next to The Falls Church.

The Falls Church, pro-

genitor of them all, fell upon
hard times in the decades fol-
lowing the Revolution. After

the close of hostilities Virginia
formally eschewed the official
state Church of England and
its followers moved to the
newly-established Protestant
Episcopal Church.  Stripped of
its guarantee of parish revenue
and humbled by its prior
association with English colonial authorities, The Falls Church lost much of its
congregation and closed its doors sometime between  1799 and  1806. It soon
fell into disrepair and, missing doors and windows, was open to the elements.
One passer-by noted that animals lived within. This state of affairs lasted until
1823, when several area residents attempted to reestablish it. While this
attempt to reopen The Falls Church was aborted it produced much-needed
repairs, including, apparently, a new roof.7

After 1823, and for the next fourteen years, the church again stood desert-
ed amidst unkempt surroundings, even as the village prospered.  It was used for
meetings of the new Falls Church Temperance Society in  1831, which met the
first Saturday of every month to promote among its members a liquor-free exis-
tence. In about  1835 students from the new Fair fax Seminary in Alexandria
became interested in The Falls Church and their labors led to reorganization of
its congregation in  1836. The church was again led by a rector from  1837 to

The Civil VVIar

ough the situation appeared grim after John Brown's raid at Harper's
erry, many in Virginia hoped to preserve the Union. But moderation was
overtaken by events.

AF

In April  1861  South Carolina began hostilities by flring on Fort Sumter
and on May 23,1861 Virginians voted to remove the Commonwealth from
the Union. In Fairfax County the vote was pro-secession. In Falls Church the
vote, while pro-secessionist, was badly split 44 to 26. Armed secessionist bands
in and around the Falls Church and nearby voting stations frightened the area's
northern sympathizers, a number of whom voted for secession, or stayed at
home, in fear of their lives.  "Vote this ticket," said one secessionist to Philip H.
Minor of Minor's Hill.  "If not, you are gone for.  .  ."I

Federal troops immediately occupied Alexandria and moved quickly from

the initial bridgeheads toward Falls Church and Ball's Cross Roads (modern
Ballston).  On June  1  the troops skirmished with secessionists-as Southerners
were called-near Bailey's Crossroads and at Fair fax Court House, the first
local events of the war.2

General Daniel Tyler and troops comprising several Connecticut militias

established a headquarters in Taylor's Tavern at Falls Church (on the hill above
modern-day East Broad Street at its intersection with Roosevelt Street). Falls
Church at this time was a compact village clustered around The Falls Church.
Between Taylor's Tavern and the village were tidy farmhouses, orchards, farm
land, and woods. In addition to its principal taverns, Taylor's and the Star,
across from The Falls Church, the prosperous little village and its environs
included four churches and about twenty-five houses. According to one con-
temporary observer the homes were ".  .  . of a superior character, proving the
owners to be persons of more than ordinary wealth and taste.  Rows of cedar
trees adorn each side of the street, and the yards around different residences

give it a most beautiful appearance."3

But Falls Church's beautiful appearance belied the disharmony which over-

took the area.  Fair fax Chapel closed its doors in the early spring of 1861, its
members divided by sectional loyalties and fearful of oncoming events.
Columbia Baptist Church fared little better. The stressful days of 1860 took
their toll as talk of possible secession by Virginia roiled the congregation. In
that year the secretary of the Potomac Association of Baptist churches recorded
in his minutes, "Columbia-Laboring under discouragements and opposition.
No cheering news to write. They are embarrassed for their house."4

This schism was reflected at the state level by the disintegration of the

General Assembly. In June  1861  delegates loyal to the Union met at Wheeling,
in Virginia's panhandle, and, declaring Virginia's governmental offlces "vacant,"
established the "Restored" state government. Francis Harrison Pierpont was
elected governor. Fairfax County, Falls Church, and Alexandria were represent-
ed, and Falls Church resident Daniel F. Dulany served as Pierpont's aide. In
1863 Virginia's western counties seceded to form West Virginia, and the capital

Meanwhile, full-scale operations by both sides began in the Falls

Church area. The Union controlled the territory from Taylor's Tavern east to
Alexandria, and the village center much more tenuously, but the country
immediately beyond Falls Church was in Confederate hands. On June 20,
1861, General Daniel Tyler telegraphed to the defensive forts in Arlington
from Falls Church that he believed an attack was imminent and asked for rein-
forcement. Two days later General Tyler telegraphed the forts another alarm
from Falls Church but, again, no action occurred.6

One innovation of this war was aerial reconnaissance-in this case from

hot air balloons. On June 22,1861, Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe with his

balloon, the E7â¬}crp7Â¢.jc, skirting Rebel scouting parties at Bailey's Cross Roads,
traveled to Taylor's Tavern at Falls Church, where it was used constantly during
the next two days. These ascensions appear to be the first aerial military recon-
naissance in the Western Hemisphere, and probably anywhere in the world.7

0n June 26  714c C4Â¢r/c:j`}o7Â¢ [S.C.]  114lcrc%rj/ incorrectly reported that Union
forces had taken Falls Church with a force of 5,000 men, confirming the con-
fused state of affairs in and around the village. Vice President Hannibal
Hamlin visited the picket line at Falls Church at around this time, "being anx-
ious to see how a Rebel looked at short range."8

Union and Confederate armies began massing for the first great battle of
the war, on the banks of Bull Run near Manassas, on July 21. Three massive
columns of union soldiers marched west, with one column, numbering about
15,000 men, passing through the Falls Church area. The affair at Bull Run was
expected by all in Washington to be a short one, in which Federal troops
would put a quick end to the rebellion. The Confederates, however, had a dif-
ferent agenda and superior leadership. The flghting, the cannonading of which
was clearly heard in Falls Church, turned against the Federals. Their advance
halted and they began an orderly retreat, which quickly degenerated into a

panic-stricken rout. Union soldiers "ran blindly, like beasts from a fire."9

In Falls Church the ragged Federals began streaming through the village in
twilight.  Pro-Unionist local citizens, who had believed they would be protected
by Union forces, found the seemingly endless retreating Union soldiers unnerv-
ing. Many quickly packed and left.10

Frightened soldiers passed through Falls Church all night long, and morn-

ing dawned over a village and countryside which, one Falls Church observer
said "seemed fllled with disheveled soldiers." During the night of July 22, the
day after the battle, advancing Confederate scouts, coming on the heels of the
last of the Union forces, penetrated the village.1l

After the Union disaster at Manassas, Confederates advanced east through

the village to Munson's and Upton's hills, which they then occupied.  General

James Longstreet established his headquarters in what is now the Lawton
House at Falls Church, to which he extended the Confederate Military
Telegraph, and from which he conducted councils of war directing the Army of
Northern Virginia. J.E.B. Stuart and his  1 st Virginia Cavalry established them-
selves on Munson's Hill, in full view of the U.S.  Capitol. Stuart took great
delight in directing his artillery to take "practice" shots at Professor Lowe's bal-
loon, which now ascended from the forts in Alexandria County (now
Arlington County)  to observe their movements, and in causing the "Long
Roll"  (battle and mobilization signal, sounded by drums)  to sound all along
the Union front by feigning attacks. This was probably the first incidence of
anti-aircraft fire anywhere.12

For the Confederates their time in Falls Church was a holding action,

intended to divert Federal attention from the build-up of their forces under
way at Centreville. They constructed fcke earthworks on Upton's and Munson's
hills and "fortified" them with falÂ±e cannons.13

An early and major battle of the local front of the war occurred in and
around Lewinsville on September  10,1861. Numerous companies of union
and Confederate soldiers, the latter from Falls Church, engaged in sharp clash-
es in the darkness of the roads and woods between Falls Church and
Lewinsville. It was a terrible night for the Union soldiers, who were outmaneu-
vered and outgunned by their opponents. On the evening of september  13
Professor Lowe, ascending in his balloon from Chain Bridge, saw what
appeared to be two burning buildings just east of Falls Church and another on
an adjacent hill, surrounded by large crowds of cheering and boisterous rebel
soldiers: the Confederates were
celebrating their victory at

Lewinsville.14

0n September 24

Professor Lowe made military
history when he ascended from
the Arlington Heights and tar-

geted fire from Fort Ethan
Allen (near Chain Bridge) on
Confederate forces at Falls
Church. This was the first aeri-
ally directed artillery fire in
American hi\story. Using a tele-

graph machine in the balloon
basket Lowe signaled the fort,
three miles away, to correct its
flre when flring fell short.

soon linked the appearance of Lowe's
balloon with increasingly threatening
fire. And thus Falls Church earned
the dubious distinction of becoming
the first community in history to be
bombarded by aerially-directed flre-
to become common in future wars.15
A smaller engagement occurred
on September 25 as the 600-man
Seventeenth Virginia Infantry,
encamped at and around The Falls
Church, was joined by the Second
South Carolina Infantry and the
Washington Artillery for an attack
on federal troops at Lewinsville and
Langley. ".  .  . While loitering around
the church," William A. Andrews of
the First Georgia Infantry later

wrote, "everything apparently at peace with the world, the long roll was beat to
arms. The regiment was quickly formed in the road. Couriers were dashing at
breakneck speed in every direction. Gen. Longstreet, whose headquarters was
not far from the church, was soon in the saddle. It was not long before the
Ninth Georgia, the Second South Carolina, Thirteenth Virginia, Col. Stuart's
regiment of Black Horse Cavalry, and Capt. Rosser's battery of artillery was on
the grounds, and away we went in the direction of Lewinsville." Another
Confederate victory ensued, after which the southern forces returned after
nightfall to Falls Church, where their hearts were "gladdened by the camp fires
of about 20,000 Confederate soldiers.''16

One consequence of Lowe's frequent ascensions to view rebel forces at Falls
Church was his discovery that the ominous "fortifications" on the hills outside
the village were not backed by corresponding levels of troops and equipment.
But the ruse had served its purpose: Confederate forces were nearly flnished
fortifying Centreville.17

On September 29 the Confederates

quietly evacuated Falls Church and its
hills for their "impregnable" position on
the Centreville heights and a forward post
at Fairfax Court House. Surprised Federal
troops quickly reoccupied Falls Church
and its hills. The next day, reflecting on
the day's ev;nts, a pleased but surprised
Gâ¬neral Heintzelman, not yet compre-
hending the successful two-month long
Confederate feint which had just con-
cluded, wrote, "We have possession of
Fall's Church and Munson's Hill .  .  .

There was no resistance."18

Almost as soon as Union forces reoc-

cupied the area some of them wreaked
vengeance or damage on unfortunate
southerners. Members of the Twenty-
second New York Infantry dismantled
Fairfax Chapel in the winter of 1862 and
used its brick for chimneys at their winter
headquarters nearby. Members of the
Twentieth New York Infantry Regiment
defaced the interior of The Falls Church
with graffiti (their names and regimental
identiflcation) in the winter of 1861 ;
their commanding offlcer made them
return the church to its former state. But
other units soon followed suit. This dam-
age paled in comparison with what would
happen to the church later in the war.
Union forces flrst used it as a hospital and
later as a stable, tearing out the furnish-
ings, floor, and walls below the windows
to afford their horses better ingress and
egress. Columbia Baptist Church was
damaged by secessionist forces during their occupation of the town. And it is
difficult if not impossible to tally the losses suffered by villagers whose homes,
crops, and flelds were harmed.19

The Falls Church figures prominently in the accounts of soldiers of both

sides of the conflict. One soldier of the Twenty-third New York Infantry,
attended services held there by his regimental chaplain on November 9,1861:
"Nearly all the men went, more, I guess, out of curiosity and novelty than from

a desire to attend church. We carried our arms which were stacked in front of
the building .  .  ." The church, "which has obtained such a notoriety in the

present struggle," he writes, is not grand; "It is its age and association connect-
ed with it that gives it its sacredness which, in fact, has almost entirely shielded
it from devastation."2o

Several nurses, volunteers dispatched by the U.S. Sanitary Commission,

ministered to the sick in Union hospitals in Falls Church. Two of them,
wealthy socialites from New York City, arrived in the winter of 1861-62 and
found men from a nearby New York regimental unit, most suffering from
typhoid in a field hospital in The Falls Church. The patients, they recounted,

were emaciated and pale.  "Come and take care of me, and I shall get well," said
one soldier when the ladies first entered.  "If you do not come, I shall die."
When they began service in the hospital it held thirty-nine patients, with six
former patients lying dead but unburied in the "dead-house."21

Falls Church was then the only village between Alexandria and Vienna,

and many soldiers identified themselves in letters home as being posted "near
Falls Church." In truth, most were posted on the hills west and northwest of
the village center-Minor's, Munson's, Perkins' and Upton's hills, for which
Falls Church was the only identifiable point of reference. Soldier camps dotted
the slopes of Minor's and Upton's hills, in particular, causing nearby farms great
damage as soldiers removed fence rails to use as flrewood; fruits and vegetables
for eating; hay and other crops for feeding horses; and cattle, hogs, and pigs for
slaughtering. Valuable timber was felled, and left lying on the ground, in order
to clear gunnery ranges from the forts on Upton's and Perkins' hills: much of
what is now the eastern areas of the City of Falls Church were entirely denuded
of trees. It is difflcult to say how many soldiers were encamped in and around
Falls Church at any one time, as companies came and went frequently, but it
appears safe to say that at certain times during the war several thousand sol-
diers were posted within two miles of the village center.

The Manassas region was again the center of a major battle in August and
September  1862. The second Battle of Manassas, or Bull Run, disrupted life in
Falls Church as Union officials, preparing to burn the village to prevent its use

by the Confederacy, ordered the vil-
lage evacuated. Local residents fled
with as much livestock and personal
belongings as they could carry, and
again Falls Church was deserted.
Rebel armies moved in opposite direc-
tions, however, sparing the village
from a fiery fate.22

Within days of the second battle

at Bull Run a human tidal wave of
misery and suffering descended on
the village as  1,600 sick and wounded
soldiers were brought to Falls Church.
The Presbyterians' Groot Hall,
Columbia Baptist Church, The Falls
Church, and many homes were

pressed into service as hospitals.
Five days after the battle ambulances
continued to arrive hourly in Falls

Church.23

Armed skirmishes and incursions were a continuing and often daily facet
of life in and around Falls Church throughout the war. Some were larger than
others: one, involving the 84th New York Infantry and the 300-man First
Virginia Cavalry, occurred one mile west of the village in November  1861  as
the Virginians were intercepted while attempting to gather "valuable informa-
tion" from the vicinity.24

In May 1864 the Thirteenth New York Cavalry headquartered itself in
Falls Church. Its commander soon complained that Col. John S. Mosby's high-
ly successful raiders were "continually around us" and observed that "the small
force of cavalry here can hardly damage the enemy. We number hundreds, and
they thousands." The erstwhile commander must certainly have been dismayed

50

by the September 14,1864 lightning raid by
Mosby against his headquarters, in which
Mosby captured the brigade butcher and
then returned to capture a quartermaster's
establishment which was only three hundred

yards from a cavalry brigade.25

The Thirteenth New York Cavalry
scored a victory against Col. Mosby on
October 2,  1864 when it captured his arse-
nal and personal saber and brought them to
Falls Church. Revenge, pure and sweet, may
have been on the minds of Mosby and 75 of
his raiders as they attacked Falls Church at 2
a.in. October  18, killing two members of the
village's home guard and capturing pickets of
the Sixteenth New York Infantry. Their raid
was disturbed by J. 8. Read, pastor of
Columbia Baptist Church, who blew a horn
to alert the rest of the village guard and the
16th. Mosby's men captured Pastor Read
and later executed him.  "That Baptist

preacher Read got what was coming to
him," said one. His wife and daughter were

granted safe passage to drive a wagon to
Tyson's Corner to retrieve his body. He is
buried in The Falls Church yard.26

The Falls Church was witness to many

more wartime funerals than just Read's.
Many Union soldiers were interred there,
some in unmarked (and presently unknown)

graves. Their funerals, commemorating
deaths of unusual and cruel variety ("rapid
consumption"; purpura haemorrhagica, "a
very rare disease''; typhoid; death by freezing; and, of course, death in battle)
were sad affairs conducted with regal, but simple, military pageantry.27

As the war closed in  1865  Falls Church again observed massive troop

movements-these all passing through the village, many camping in or near it,
destined for the final review of troops by the president in Washington. The vil-
lage and its inhabitants suffered many privations in the course of the conflict-
churches shuttered, congregations divided; families split on basis of sectional
loyalties; the prosperous and fertile fields alternately trampled and neglected;
the village deserted during the most dangerous points during the war; a local

pastor killed; and the local economy in ruins. Falls Church, just outside the
capital's defensive fortiflcations, and never in the complete and uncontested
control of either side, had been a particularly busy area during the Civil War.
Over eighty-flve regiments are known to have camped in or passed through the
area. The hopes and fears of the Confederate nation were met in bloody battle-
fields on the "sacred soil" of virginia, and Falls Church played a role.
Reconstruction, of a most personal and wrenching kind, would occupy the vil-
lagers of Falls Church for a long time.

A Sense Of Commundy

newcomers from New England, the mid-Atlantic states, and the mid-West.
Attracted to the area by good farmland available at bargain prices, a relatively
mild climate and prospects of economic growth, these Northerners brought
new energy; new capital and new ideas about how to get things done.

The incorporation of the village into the Town of Falls Church in  1875

gave it new legal status with control of part of its taxes, roads, schools, and
other public facilities. For the next quarter of a century, the town grew in pop-
ulation and prosperity as it increased its agricultural output for sale to
Georgetown, Washington, and Alexandria merchants.

Churches were organized to serve as both religious and community centers.
The Falls Church, Fair fax Methodist Chapel, and Columbia Baptist had been
built prior to the Civil War. Shortly after hostilities ceased, the "colored settle-
mentÂ» built both the Galloway Methodist and Second Baptist churches. The
white community then built, in a period of fewer than twenty years, Dulin
Methodist, Crossman Methodist, St. James Catholic Chapel, First
Congregational, and Falls Church Presbyterian churches. I

Virginia's  1869 Underwood Constitution made many changes including
new laws regulating both the county forms of government and universal public
education in the Commonwealth. Where appointed justices had formerly been
responsible for administration of county affairs, the new rules called for eventu-
al division of each county into magisterial districts within which voters would
select a representative to serve on a Board of County Supervisors. Court jus-
tices were to be responsible for judicial affairs only. Universal education was

promised, although separate schools were to be provided for white and black
children.2

A Board of School Trustees for each magisterial district was responsible ini-

tially for adopting rules for government of schools within their district. On
March 6,1871, a public notice was printed and distributed for the Falls
Church school district announcing seventeen rules. The many daily procedures
to be followed included opening exercises requiring reading of sacred scrip-
tures. Pupils were to appear in school with proper neatness; a pupil possessing a

pistol or other dangerous weapon was to be suspended; and no teacher or pupil
was permitted to use tobacco in any form during school hours.3

Efforts were made to put together broken pieces of things everywhere,

especially where railroads were concerned. The Alexandria, Loudoun and
Hampshire Railroad bridges had to be rebuilt. Tracks were replaced and nature
herself had to be pushed back in the places where she was reclaiming the right-
of-way with rapidly growing saplings, shrubs, and vines. When the railroad was
again functioning and renamed the Washington and Ohio Railroad, President
U. S. Grant and members of his cabinet rode it through Falls Church in  1873

59

on a day-long junket to visit Leesburg and
the exhibition of the Agricultural Society
at the Fair Grounds. They listened to the
town band and had dinner with Col. John
W.  Fairfax.4

By a Virginia Act of Assembly

approved in  1875, portions of Fairfax and
Alexandria (now Arlington) counties were
"made a town corporate" named Falls

Church.  Besides being incorporated, the
town's charter was adopted. A long-stand-
ing tradition holds that Joseph Riley of
"Cherry Hill" lobbied the act through the

legislature to successful passage. Town
councilmen appointed were J. J. Moran, T.
T.  Fowler, J. E. Birch, Isaac Crossman, L.
E.  Gott, G. 8. Ives, and Joel Carter. Henry

J. England was appointed Town Clerk and
E. Frank Crocker, Town Sergeant.5

At the first organizational meeting

of the mayor, J. J. Moran and the flrst
councilmen, J.  S. Riley was asked to
deliver in person the offlcial notice
to the Hon. James Love, Fair fax County's
Commonwealth's Attorney, that the
Council had been organized following the
incorporation by the Virginia Assembly
of the Town of Falls Church.6 Ordinances
of the Towns of Keyser and Hamilton were
to be used as models for drafting suitable

ordinances for the Town of Falls Church.7

The flrst ordinance adopted regulated flreworks, guns and pistols "and

things pertaining to the same." Subsequent ordinances were adopted for pre-

Dulin United Methodist Church, as it has

looked Since  1926,  in a  1972 photo. The

vention of: intoxication and vagrancy; public lewdness or indecency, graffiti,
indecent painting, engraving, prints or sculpture. Illustrative of the rural nature
of the town at the time was the passage of an ordinance making it unlawful to
hitch or turn at large any cow, horse, or hog to graze on any of the sidewalks or
highways of the town.8

Frederick Forrest Foote, Jr., a respected black businessman in the commu-

nity, served the Town of Falls Church for ten or more years, first as town ser-

geant from  1876 to  1880, and then as a town councilman from  1880 to  1889.
No Town Council minutes have survived for the years  1885 to  1897.9

One subject which appeared on the Council's agenda at almost every meet-

ing was the need of repairs for roads, bridges, and sidewalks. Loads of stone
were bought at 25,  50, or 75 cents per ton,
hauled and broken up by hand using large stone
hammers or a mechanical stone crusher, and

placed in the gaping holes in the non-hard-sur-
faced roadways.10 Bridges were usually built of
wooden planks and they quickly rotted from use
and weather and had to be replaced.11

Sometimes standing water was a problem.
Councilman G. M. Thompson complained at one
Council meeting that he needed sidewalks for his
house as he "could scarcely get in or out after a
heavy rain and his dooryard was at times naviga-

ble for small boats."12

Public school education was a major concern
of the Town. G.A.C. Merrifield presented a peti-
tion signed by taxpayers to the Council in  1876
to levy a tax for the purpose of sustaining public
free schools in the Corporation.13 More than two

years later, the Town Council called a public
school meeting to devise means of continuing the

graded school and to form a committee to deter-
mine the advisability of being relieved from the

County tax for schools.14

The following year,1879, the Town Council

recorded in the minutes a high degree of frustra-
tion over the school situation: "Whereas, the State
of virginia having failed to provide for the main-
tenance of County and District public schools in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution
of the state of virginia and the necessity of a pub-
lic school in the Town of Falls Church" a resolu-
tion was passed by the Council calling for a
school-age population census and making a determination of the amount of
assistance available for conducting a corporation public school from the State,
County, District or other funding sources.  "The said school shall be under the
control and direction of the Council of Falls Church and their delegated
appointments."15 I. S. Riley, who had been elected to the Town Council in
October 1876, stated for the record that "this matter of public schools is of
vast importance and something should be done by the Council in order tha.t an
effort may be made to have a public school in the Corporation." Mayor Ives
appointed to the Committee on Schools: J. S.  Riley, G. M. Thompson and

J.C.H. Brown.16 Action begun immediately resulted in the opening of the

An issue which had long been
under discussion in the town was finally
resolved when the Council voted to pur-
chase three acres of land adjoining the
old Methodist Chapel grounds for a
cemetery. A large committee of promi-
nent citizens was appointed to view the

Proposed site.18

Another problem was flre flghting.
The Council discussed various measures
in  1879 and early in  1880 ordered flre
buckets and wood with which to build
six flre ladders of different lengths.19
Petitions signed by more than a two-
thirds majority of voters favored purchase
of fire apparatus in  1899, with a levy for

purchase of fifteen cents tax per $ 100
carried. The Council approved the bid of
the C. T. Halloway Fire Engine Co. of
Baltimore for the purchase of a flre

engine.20

One of the present businesses in Falls

Church was established in  1883. James
W. Brown came to Falls Church from
Loudoun County where he had grown
up and been a school teacher. He pur-
chased for his store and home a structure
built by Edward Birch in  1866. Between
1872 and  1881  it was also used as

the post office.2l

The Village Improvement Society

of Falls Church was organized in the fall
of 1885. It was modeled after the famous
Laurel Hill Society of Stockbridge,
Massachusetts and its objectives were to

Secorid Baptist Church, an African-
American congregation off Amtlndele Ri)ad,

1921. This building, constructed in  1870,

was abandoned in f;avor of the building in

use today, bttile in  1926. The church was

1887. Scrapbook of Barban williams.

aid in improving the condition of the village. In  1892, the Society inaugurated
the first observance of Arbor Day in the Commonwealth of virginia. It was
held at the Jefferson Institute.22

A section of the town south of the thoroughfare then known as the Falls

Church and Fairfax Courthouse Road was by a Virginia Act of Assembly
returned to the jurisdiction of Fair fax County. This amendment, passed
in  1887, directed the transfer of the boundary of the section of land then
called "the colored settlement" to outside the corporate limits of the town.23
Since 26 percent of the black males voted Republican the boundary change

gerrymandered the territory in favor of the remaining Town voters who were
mainly Democrats.24

Communications were markedly improved when the Falls Church
Telephone Company was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly in
1888. Its incorporators were forward-looking citizens of the Town and includ-
ed Robert Morrison, W.  H.  Doolittle, Schuyler Duryee, E. J. Northrup, Dr. T.

A clear indication of the rapidly-increasing popularity of Falls Church as a

residential village was given in the Ftzz.r/zzx fJc#jz# in  1891. A special train was
run from Washington on a Tuesday in June bringing about 400 people to a sale
of lots in the new Sherwood subdivision. "The bidding was active from the
start, and ninety-two lots were sold at an aggregate price of $23,000."
Developer Church must have been pleased.26

Merton Elbridge Church was born in Orleans County, Vermont in  1858,

son of Joshua and Mary Elizabeth (Cobb) Church. After his father died while
serving in the Union Army, in  1862, his mother married George S. Spofford
and eventually moved to Virginia.

Merton E. Church was a talented entrepreneur. He was trained as a phar-

macist in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and owned pharmacies in Herndon and
Falls Church. He went into the real estate and insurance business and devel-
oped a telephone system throughout Northern Virginia which he eventually
sold to the Chesapeake 8c Potomac Telephone Company in  1916. The Falls
Church Improvement Company, of which he was general manager and a la.rge
stockholder, successfully developed "Sherwood" in Falls Church, west of the

present-day Lincoln Avenue, and one of the first subdivisions put on the mar-
ket in Fair fax County. He was a founder and director of the Falls Church Bank
and served on the boards of several others, and was an ardent supporter of rail-
way service to Northern Virginia. Ironically, Church was also a strong advocate
for another improvement-road building.27 Gradually roads replaced rails for

preferred transportation.

York,  Pennsylvania, Ohio,  Indian,  Illinois, Connecticut, and other states

found themselves telegraphing home the news,  "Ordered to Falls Church, Va."I

The various state militias were in need of training before deployment. The War
Department in Washington secured a two-square mile tract of land west of
Falls Church which it named Camp Russell A. Alger after the secretary of war.

Camp Alger occupied the area roughly bounded by the present Lee Highway,
Hollywood Road, Gallows Road, Arlington Boulevard and Graham Road.2

Over twenty regiments forming the U.S.  Second Corps took residence there,

totaling almost 30,000  soldiers.

Typhoid broke out in mid-July  1898. Most soldiers and officers blamed

the "water famine," caused by lack of drinkable water for the fever and for the
cases of diarrhea which plagued the camp. The incidence of typhoid, which

sickened many and accounted for most of the seventy-three deaths reported
there, flgured prominently in soldiers'  diary entries and letters home, prompt-

ing recriminations felt in the state capitals and in Washington.3

But all was not hardship. Troops made excursions into Washington, where

they usually visited the Capitol, Navy Yard, Library of Congress, and
Smithsonia.n. These trips to and from Falls Church overwhelmed the train sta-
tions and streets, causing disarray and chaos in the town.  Provost guards from

Camp Alger encamped permanently at East Falls Church to assist in maintain-
ing order and directing traffic.  One soldier wrote,  "The pandemonium  [at East

Falls Church's trolley station]  hcrc is something frightful. Tickets are purchased
in the store across the track, while lemonade, soda water and candy vendors

combine with colored bootblack and clothes ttrush boys, not to mention the
hackmen, to raise a rumpus which is absolutely unforgettable."4

Falls Church residents sometimes bore the brunt of soldier roughhousing

and war games.  On the evening of July 2, men of the Sixth Pennsylvania

Infantry, erroneously believing themselves released for the Independence Day
weekend, left on foot. Troop "A" of the New York Cavalry was called to arms:
"We galloped over the main road  [Lee Highway]  to Falls Church,  a cloud of

dust enveloping all but the flrst two sets of fours." The troops must have made

an impressive appearance, as the leaders,  followed t>y the moving cloud, thun-

dered down the steep hills with their weapons clashing, and the drawn sabres

gleaming in the moonlight at intervals through the dust.  Falls Church, howev-
er, was "quiet as the grave." Troop "A"  then "commenced a wild chase, scouring
the surrounding country on every side in the direction of wa`shington." One

by one the missing Pennsylvanians were rounded up, sometimes thirty men at

a  time.  5

The colorful Troop "A" visited Falls Church aga.in en masse,  this time to

make a "grand attack" on the village. They were careful to leave blank car-

75

tridges behind at camp so that "the villagers might not suppose that the civil
war had recommenced." They were then surprised by Troop "C," which did
not leave behind blank cartridges,  and a "lively"  (and surely noisy)  engagement

followed.`'

Falls Church residents found Camp Alger a very noisy neighbor indeed.

Much of the village was within earshot of the gunfire emanating from the prac-

tice skirmishes there.  Each day began and closed with regimental buglers

sounding reveille and taps, the notes echoing over the fields and woods.  "The
neighingofhorscs,therattleofemprywagons,trampofthetroops,while

above all sounded the ceaseless roll of drums or practice of bands  .  .  .  made a
life of activity comparable to nothing outside the army," wrote one soldier,

adding,  "Singing, as in all camps, was a favorite pastime with the men  .  .  .
Each company had its glee club, and after supper, as night fell, you were sure
to hear from every  [company]  street the familiar choruses by the men, varied

by occasional solos by the best singers.  `Break the News to Mother,'  `Say Au

Revoir,' `Nearer, My God, to Thee,'  `Marching Through Georgia,'  `The Old
Oaken  Bucket,'  etc., were favorites of an endless  repertoire."7

Coexistence of the massive camp with the adjacent town of Falls Church

was always tenuous. Temperance leaders in the village were incensed by

the "boom-town" called the Midway Plaisance,  named for the camival strip
made famous by the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of 1893,
which grew along the Warrenton Pike (present-day Lee Highway)  in the
vicinity of Merrifleld. The tents, shacks, stalls and vendors' stands of the

Plaisance supplied the soldiers with alcohol which, many in the village felt,

was cause of much of the carousing by soldiers which took place there.
Coexistence of the two-village and camp-was also sorely tested by Falls
Church residents' dislike of being stopped by army road patrols while going

about their own  business.

The visit of President William MCKinley provided Camp Alger its biggest

day on May 22 as he brought several cabinet officers and foreign dignitaries
to review the troops.  Fifteen thousand soldiers prepared to parade before the

president and his entourage, and the troops assigned to escort him from the
train sta.tion busily polished brass and brushed off uniforms, but to no avail:

The president was by no means the only dignitary to visit Camp Alger.

Chinese Legation and of the Norwegian and revolutionary Cuban armies all

paid calls, as did members of Congress. And Carl Sandburg,  a soldier at the

camp theater, enjoyed sarsaparilla and ice cream, and viewed what must have

been Falls Church's greatest fireworks display until recent years.10

But the war was among the shortest in

American history. Most at Camp Alger never saw
combat.  Even after the Kingdom of Spain signed

peace protocols,  insurrection continued in the
Philippine Islands,  requiring garrison troops,

but Camp Alger's role was ended. The last of
the regiments departed September 8. The troops
had wreaked such havoc on the land tha.t it was
"a bleak sand waste" and unproductive for many

years  to  come.11

Lessons learned in  1898-the necessity and
ability to coexist with welcome and unwelcome cir-
cumstances, developments, and conditions-were

to prove instrumental  to  Falls  Church's success  in
the century soon to dawn. The villagers' new-found
flexibility and adaptability would soon assert itself

in positioning the town for growth and prosperity
during what many would come to call "the
American century." The Spanish-American War

proved a valuable litmus test for Falls Church for
the changi.s soon  to come.

Domestic Tranquilly

A Camp Alger closed down and Spanish-American War soldicrs' activities

ad ceased to have an impact on  Falls Church,  the Town Council turned
its attention to local problems.  Fire equipment was purchased and the
Fire Company was invited to participate in the Fourth of July parade.I  Many

commuliity affiniry groups had been organized in Falls Church by  1899. They

included a wide variety of intere`sts:  the Potomac Fruit Growers Association, a
farmers' cooperative;  the Independent Order of Good Templars; the Village

Improvement Society;  the International Order of odd Fellows;  the Kemper

Masonic Lodge,  the Volunteer Fire Department; and the R.  E.  Lee Chapter,
Daughters of the Confederacy.2

The future for the new twentieth century looked especially bright with the

establishment of a highly-respected training school under an energetic and
well-trained principal, Mattie Gundry, and a Falls Church library which was in
the next hundred years to become a vital cultural and educational center for

residents of town and city.J

Educator Miss Mattie Gundry purchased residential property on West

Broad Street near Little Falls  Street from Schuylcr Duryee in  1899.  She

enlarged the building and developed a campus for the Virginia Training School
which she operated successfully for almost fifty years.  She taught her mentally

disadvantaged students useful  knowledge and skills to enrich  their lives.4

Nonfunctioning oil street lamps or problems with  the lamplightcr seemed

to appear almost every month in the council's  1899 minutes.  Complaints

about the poor maintenance of the electric trolley crossings on the public

streets were almost as frequent.  One petition asked that someone fix the culvert

at a crossing "to  at least make the water run downhill."5  Living with  the rail-
roads was not easy.  One resident requested that the mayor effect abatement of

the noise made t)y the Southern  Railway's locomotive whistles.(`

Vandalism had become a problem and by  1901,  the council adopted a res-
olution authorizing the mayor to put the town sergeant on active duty to con-

trol  disorderly conduct (]r to appoint special policemen for the purpose.7  Litter

was another ever-present source of irritation. The VIllagc Improvement Society

requested at a council  meeting that same year that the litter ordinance be strict-

ly enforced.8

Future author James Thurber and his family,  including two brothers, lived

in a rented house on Maple Street in the summers of 1901  and  1902, when hc

was six years old.  In letters to Mrs.  Frank Acosta in  1958  and  1959, Thurber
recalled some of his vivid memories of Falls Church.  Fascimted by one of the

town's employees, he wrote:  "Our garbage was collected by an ancient white-
haired negro,  no more that five feet tall, whose two-wheeled oxcdrt was pulled

by a brace of oxen.  His appearance never failed to enchant us boys, for hc was
not only out of the South, but out of the past, even out of fiction,  as remark-

able as old Uncle Tom himself." It was in Falls Church that Thurbcr lost one of

his  eyes as  the result of a childhood accident.`J

83

The Thurbers were followed by
many renters for both summer and

winter.  By  1903,  real estate agents,

subdivision developers  and poten-

tial  residents of Falls Church were

using the trolley services.  In  addi-

tion to land purchases,  renters

were eager to live in Falls Church

in all seasons. The F#z.r/zzx fJc#jz/J'j

Falls Church correspondent pub-
lished the information that "more

people have recently rented houses
in our town for the winter than

was ever known before. A house is
scarcely vacated by the summer

residents before a new tenant

moves  in."10

Cultural enrichment was

beginning to be a part of village

life. The Falls Church Library

not get electricity until  1912.  It proved so

popular that  ky  1912  the  iou/n i;ound it

had only been in existence for four years when the Library Association and
its Board of Control published a  C4f#/ogace a/Boo4f listing all of the 650 items

in their collection. The civic-minded officers for  1903 were Pickering Dodge,

president;  Dr.  George 8.  Fadeley, vice president; William A.  Ball,  secretary;
and George W.  Hawxhurst, librarian. Advertisers whose ads helped pay for
the publication were business people from Falls Church, Leesburg, and

A strong interest in protecting native birds was formalized in  1903 when

the Virginia State Audubon Society was established in Falls Church. John 8.
Henderson was the first president.  One of the principal goals of the organiza-

tion was to promote a popular interest in bird study.  Children under sixteen

paid no dues  but signed pledge cards agreeing not to harm birds or their eggs.12
It was around this time that Joseph Harvey Riley of Cherry Hill  in Falls

Church embarked upon his life career as a renowned professional ornithologist

at the  Smithsonian.I-) A successor branch organization,  the  Fair fax Audubon

Society,  now meets monthly at the National Wildlife Federation  in Vienna.14

In  his book F&//f  C4"rc4.. j4  Vz'rgz.7Â».a  Vz./4ggc published in  1904,  Charles A.

Stewart noted that there were then few old houses in the village.  One comment
he wrote is of interest:  "The old big chimney house situated in the ficld oppo-

site the Odd Fellows'  Hall was built in  Revolutionary times and is probably the

oldest  dwelling  in  this vicinity."15

Stewart also wrote of the "colored settlement"  a short distance south of the

town limits, consisting of about a hundred cottages with a population between
four and five hundred.  "They have a school building and three churches and
many of the little cottages and surroundings indicate industry and thrift in the

occupants."l('

Stewart described Falls Church as the place where

d:en may  e.njay life with riatae:e, where the climate,  condueiue to refreshing

sleep,.spothes tired nerves and makes life to such again bttayant with

youthful hopes  and jays.17

A new church building and a parochial school were built in the town

between  1902 and  1906. The stone building of st. James Roman Catholic

Church was erected in  1902 and the St. James Catholic Elementary School was

built facing Broad Street in  1906. They are still located across from one anoth-

er on  spring street.I8

If any evidence was needed in  1910 that Falls Church was in at least one

regard still a sleepy little country town,  it was provided by an earlier council

ordinance passed again  that year.  In  part,  it read:  ".  .  .  It shall  not be lawful
for any person to fasten, turn at large or permit any cow,  ox, horse,  mule
or hogs or other animals to graze on any of the sidewalks or highways of the

town  .  .   ",9

Major changes were made the very next year. The Rosslyn Gas Company

was  extending its  lines to Falls  Church.20 And after years of council discussions

the decision was made to electrify the town.  Requests for bids were released but
the only response was made by Merton E.  Church,  General Manager of the
Arlington Electric Company. The council accepted his offer to buy the fran-

chise for S 10.00. The formal let-
ter of notification and accept-
ance was dated January  11,

1912.2]  After all of the years of

problems with kerosene street
lamps,  the council was surely

relieved to direct that lighting of

kerosene street lamps  be discon-
tinued at the end of April

1912.22

After lengthy discussions
had been held at many meetings

before the Falls Church town
council, it adopted on

December  14,1914,  the
Virginia state act approved

March  12,1912,  providing for

designation of segregated dis-
tricts for residence of white and

Colored  persons.23

Five men from the black
community appeared at the fol-
lowing January  1915  council

meeting protesting passage of

the segrega.tion ordinance. J.  8. Tinner,  Rev. Y. W.  Powell, Rev. J. W.  Colbert,
E.  8.  Henderson,  and G. W.  Simmons spoke on the subj.ect.24 The ordinance

was enacted and the council's segregation committee was instructed to prepare

a map showing the boundaries of segregation districts Nos.  I  and 2.2S

Early in  1915, however,  E.  8.  Henderson had called a meeting with lead-

ing black citizens of Falls Church to oppose the proposed segregation ordi-

nance for the town of Falls Church. The group organized the Colored Citizens
Protective League  (CCPL)  and Henderson urged them to elect Joseph Tinner

pre`sident.  Later that year,  the organization  became the Falls Church and

dedicated post office  in  touJn.  Courtesy  Mrs.

abandoned efforts to

Decades passed dur-

ing which federal legisla-

tion was passed to eliminate

segregation and its many

inequities. An important Supreme

Court decision was  made  in  1954  call-

ing for equal opportunity in public educa-

tion.  In  1964,  the Civil  Rights Act provided the first

federal fair employment practices  law,  prohibiting discrimination on  the basis

of race, color,  religion, national origin, or sex by employers, employment agen-

cies,  and union.  Fair housing was mandated by additional  statutes. The  1915

segregation ordinance was repealed by the Falls Church City Council in

February  1999.27

The Great Tmar

he lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them

lit again in our lifetime," mused Edward Grey,  the British foreign
secretary in  1914, as diplomacy failed and war loomed.10n April 6,

1917, Congress declared war on the Central Powers.

Compulsory draft registration began in May.  Falls Church registrar George

T.  Mankin soon found himself very busy, registering  114 men by early June,  a
larger number than any other area of the county save Vienna.2

The need for land around Washington on which to conduct war activities
became acute as the war effort moved into high gear.  "SELECT OLD CAMP
ALGER,"  the Ftzz.r/zz}Â¢ fJc#4/J boomed, editorializing, somewhat romantically,
that "the country  [near Falls Church]  is gently rolling, well drained, and with
no nearby marshes to breed malaria. The health of the recruits would be safe-

guarded by selecting this point." Several thousand Spanish-American War vet-
erans of Camp AIger would probably have contested this point. And perhaps
they did:  the Army inspected the old camp site and rejected it in favor of land

at what became Fort Belvoir.  Had the Camp Alger site been chosen Falls
Church would have embarked on a very different course, with a giant, perma-
nent,  military base just outside town  limits.3

Consumer goods were redirected to the war front to feed soldiers and as

war materiel.  By winter  1917 Falls Church felt the brunt of mandatory

rationing as coal, an important home heating fuel, became scarce.  By early

1918 the fuel crunch was so severe that meetings were canceled so that citizens

might conserve their fuel supplies.4

Food supplies were equally problematic. J.  Parker Milburn,  the Fair fax

County food administrator,  urged citizens to observe meatless Tuesdays and
wheatless Wednesdays. Mondays later joined Wednesdays in wheatless fare, and
at least one meal of every day was to be wheatless and another meatless.  Lack

of wheat became so dire it spawned the creation of "Victory Bread," an unap-

petizing wartime recipe which county bakers were required to prepare using
alternative ingredients.  Flour and sugar soon joined the list of rationed foods,

and by April  1918 local citizens were urged to forego the use of wheat com-

pletely until at least September.  "BLOOD OR BREAK,"  read one notice in an
area newspaper.  "Others are giving their blood. You will shorten the war and

save life if you eat only what you need,  and waste nothing."5

Falls Church leaders were particularly active in supporting the war

effort. Town residents played an active role in the county War Camp
Recreation Society, assisted by the Village Improvement Society, and carried

out an ambitious fund-raising program. The Red Cross chapter in Falls

Church raised almost $2,000 during one drive, nearly three times the goal.

Local residents assisted the county Red Cross in purchasing a motorized
ambulance and motorcycle for use at the front. The Young Men's Christian

Association  (Y.M.C.A.)  directed locally by Merton E.  Church,  also raised

funds successfully.6

Americans financed the war via a series of four
Liberty Loans.  Falls Church residents committed $7,700

through their local bank during the first loan drive and

$22,000 in the second drive, with many, it was assumed,

pledging in Washington, D.C. banks,  for a much greater
total.  Each of the four local loan drives was

oversubscribed.7

Falls Church men formed a home defense league, the

Colonial Rifles, which was active throughout the war. The
town council appropriated money for uniforms, but not

guns, and the company never received rifles for all its men.
Its membership peaked at approximately forty-five.8

Yet no one in Falls Church contributed more to the

war than those men at the front. Newly-drafted soldiers
spent the first few months of the war in training camps,
and, fully seven months after Congress declared war, most
of the twenty-four Falls Church men then serving in the
armed forces were still at Camp Lee outside Petersburg,
Virginia.  Reports began returning of wounds and deaths as

local men made it to the front. Twenty-nine year old
Edward G.  Fenwick, of the University of virginia ambu-
lance corps, shot through a cheek, appears to have been the
first man wounded abroad. Stephen P.  MCGroarty, 23,

became the first Falls Church and Fairfax County ba.ttle
fatality.  He was followed by Walter L. Taverner and Ralph
Stambaugh. The terrible litany of reports of wounds and

deaths at the front would be broken only by the war's end.9

Death struck more than the soldiers. The greatest pandemic in recorded

history,  the Spanish Influenza, or, "the Flu," bred in the trenches and mass

population movements engendered by the war, attacked 40-50 percent of the
world's population, killing 22,000,000.  Unlike most viral episodes the Spanish
Flu attacked young and active adults-those cla.sses of population usually least

susceptible. Virologists believe the elderly bore antibodies developed in the late
nineteenth century when a similar, though lesser flu passed through the area-
to which younger people bore no resistance.  "Cover up each cough and sneeze;
if you don't you'll spread disease," went the popular admonition, but disease

visited Fair fax County despite public effort.  Falls Church and the portions of
the county nearest Alexandria and Washington were particularly hard hit.
Schools and churches closed and all meetings of any kind were suspended for

over a month in  October-November  1918,  until  infection rates lessened.1Â°
When the Armistice ended the conflict in November  1918  almost one

hundred soldiers from Falls Church,  a large percentage of its population of
fourteen hundred, were then serving.  Falls Church greeted the peace which fol-
lowed the Armistice with relief and jubilation.  Rationing was curtailed and

then ended. The flu gradually played itself out, a.nd the veterans began return-
ing from the front.  Falls Church had been a busy place during the war. Merton
E.  Church, the town banker,  noted that with "the increased number of
Government clerks and war activities in Washington the housing problem has

become very acute .  .  .  Every house in Falls Church is rented and we could rent
many more if we had them."I I  But slowly the local economy and war-weary
Falls Church returned to normal.

terrible state of area roads. The first privately owned automobile, or
"machine,"  as  they were called,  made its appearance in  Falls Church  about

1907.  It was owned by Ralph and Mabel Garland, and was top-of-the-line (it

had headlamps).  Other Falls Church inhabitants bought machines and soon

they outnumbered horses and buggies. I

At the dawn of the automobile age roads in the Falls Church area were

a detriment to travel.  "The automobile was born into a roadless world,"

according to one contemporary Washington editorialist.2 It was an era in
which  roads and highways developed by local usage and not through concerted

government policy. They bore names, not numt)ers, and were usually short-
haul.  Falls Church business leaders recognized that linking the village via good

roads with Washington would increase markets by expanding trade.

A group of visionary citizens known as the Lee Highway Association
was attempting to build a coast-to-coast highway across the southern United

States to be named in honor of Robert E.  Lee, as companion to one being
built across the northern tier of states in honor of Abraham Lincoln.3 The

genius of the Lee Highway effort was that it promised travelers a highway
bearing the same designation-then a novelty-and passable in all seasons

along  its entire length.4

Sensing an historic opportunity,  Falls  Church's preeminent citizens con-

vinced the Lee Highway Association to rcroute the proposed road through the

town.S They organized a local branch of the association to rally efforts,6 paid

substantial subscription fees,  and arranged  large-scale private financing to get
the road built.7 The road they proffered-the present Lee Highway, U.S.
Highway 29-consisted of worn-out pavement for a mile east of the village
center, while west of town between Falls Church and Fairfax Court House it
was a narrow dirt track reliable only in dry weather.8

Falls Church's gamble paid off.  Real estate agents reported "one thousand

per cent increase in sales and one hundred per cent increase in value" of prop-
erty along the new highway. Yes, Falls Church citi7.ens paid a lot of money to

garner the highway, but, according to the mollified town banker, Merton E.
Church, "WE NEVER MADE A BETTER INVESTMENT.''`)

Pleased by the commercial success of the new Lee Highway and boasting

immodestly,  "we will  not rest until  the United States  is paved,""I the Lee

Highway Association and Falls Church citizens almost immediately began

planning the route now known as Arlington Boulevard  (U.S.  Highway 50),
intending for it to pass through Falls Church. The route, also honoring Robert

E.  Lcc and called Lee Boulevard (until renamed in honor of Arlington  House,

Lee's home,  to allay the confusion)  was  never national  ill scope.  It was  to link

Washington with the new Shenandoah National Park.I I  Falls Church residents

was called until  the  1950s)  and were among its greatest financial

backers,  but the economics of increasing road frontage prevailed,

and the new road passed outside of the town limit.12

Another consequence of the advent of the personal automo-

bile was the decline of railroad  ridership. The electric trolley,  the

Washington-Virginia Railway, long linking East and West Falls
church to downtown Washington, entered a period of steep
decline and was liquidated in  1927.  Merton  E.  Church organi7.ed

the Arlington and Fair fax Railway Company, or A&F, out of its

remnants and led it energetically until  his  death  four years later.
Soon afterward, however,  the A8cF  lost its right-of-way to

Washington and,  in the face of ever-increasing automobile owner-

ship,  closed  for good  in  1939.13

The  1920s were a time of great prosperity, both in the

country at large and in Falls Church. Among the era's most
important achievements was the right of women to vote, granted

by a federal constitutional amendment in  1920.  In Falls Church
Mi`ss Mattie Gundry, proprietor of a home and school for the

mentally handicapped]  and Mrs.  P.  H.  Smyth were elected to the

town council in  1921.  Miss Gundry,  a firebrand,  bccamc well-

known for her leadership and research in national matters con-

cerning mental handicaps.14

The town council was advised of a new problem in  1920

when the electric company wrote them that it was going to bill

the town for all light bulbs broken by vandals. There were other

similar annoyances as reported by a Village Improvement Society committee in
November pointing out many depredations made by boys of the town recently.

Falls  Church's electric street lamps,  in  place only eight years,  made an  inviting
new target for youthful mayhem.15

Perhaps the most momentous event occurring during the interwar years

was the separation of East Falls Church from the town.  Until separation Falls

Church  and West Falls Church were within Fair fax County and East Falls

Church was within Arlington County.  Separation sentiment was first voiced in

1921  but little activity occurred on the question  until  1932, when  East Falls

Church citizens, citing "intolerable confusion of overlapping governmental

agencies,"  successfully petitioned the cil.cuit court for permission  to  lcavc the
town.  By court order, Arlington County wa.s required to pay 29.6 percent of
the principal and interest due on outstanding school bonds and  18  percent of

the water bonds. The eastern area of the town, containing 25  percent of its

population  and area,  30  percent of its  taxable value and  60  percent of. its stores
and businesses, was  not,  as  now,  geographically isolated  from  the rest of Falls

but lost,  and  East Falls  Church withdrew from the  town on April 30,1936.1r.

The East Falls Church business district was largely eradicated by the advent of

interstate highway 66  in  the  1970s.

The Great Depression, which defined the life and character of the times in

most other places, had but limited impact on Falls Church, where most resi-

dents held secure government jobs. Their guaranteed salaries, in turn,  meant
continued prosperity, or at least solvency, for the merchants and services in
town which supported them. The few area residents falling into harm's way

economically were helped by local citizens and organizations, which saw to  it

Deal "alphabet soup" agencies, the Works Project Administration and Public
Works Administration.  Periodic drought conditions and a more than doubling
of the town's population-from  1,007 in  1900 to 2,109 in  1930-had an
adverse effect on the level of the underground water table by which shallow

domestic dug wells and the somewhat deeper drilled wellLs were supplied.
By  1930,  failure of the water supply in the town had been  felt by 40 percent

of the 316 households. The town council contracted to deliver water to house-
holders by truck and in September and October, over 33,000 gallons were

supplied  at cost.I8

After careful  investigation, the council found that the cost of purchasing

water from Arlington County would be excessive.  On advice from a consultant

in the United States Geological Survey,  the mayor and council decided to

provide the needed water from town-drilled wells into a new central piping
system. The first of four wells was drilled on a lot behind the old First

Congregational Church, where the town's first water storage tank was built.19

By the mid-1940s, a more dependable water source was needed because

of increased demands. A connection was made with Arlington County near

Chain Bridge from which water was piped to Falls Church and the Fort
Buffalo  (now Seven Corners)  area.  By the  1950s,  now a city,  Falls Church

completed its own Potomac River crossing and a direct connection to the
Dalecarlia Treatment Plant in Maryland.  Currently,  the City of Falls Church

provides water to approximately  120,000 people in and around Falls Church.
It operates six pumping stations and nine storage  tanks strategically located

within  the service area.20

Prior to  1937, when the U.S. government gave a Public Works Admini-

stration grant to the town, each Falls Church residence had a privy or a septic

tank.  In that year, the first public sewer system was constructed after the suc-
cessful passage of a sewer bond issue by the  town's voters. As early as  1901,  the

local Board of Health had received numerous complaints of unsanitary privies

in  town  a.nd the complaints continued for decades.21

With periodic improvements to the system, the service area now includes

3,300 homes within the city and approximately 650 homes adjacent to the
city. The City's waste water is treated under contract either with Arlington
County's Four Mile Run system or Fa.irfax County's Tripps Run system.22

House to house garbage collection began  in  1937,  the fruit of a campaign

by the Falls Church Woman's Club.2.3 An equally important municipal
improvement was the incorporation of the volunteer fire department in  1925.
Education took great leaps in  1924 when the Commonwealth granted
Falls Church its own school district.  In  1926 Madison Elementary School

opened, with grades  1-7, and the venerable Jefferson Institute became a
four-year high school.

The relative affluence of Falls Church was highlighted in January  1936

when the State Theater opened.  Local pundits called it "the finest theater in

Arlington and Fairfax counties."  It seated over eight hundred,  featured a large

stage to be used for plays and public events and a lounge which could be used

for teas,  bridge  parties,  and  meetings.  Its parking lot accommodated 250  cars
and its interior was air-conditioned-an innovation not yet available in typical
homes.  ("Manufacturing its own weather throughout the year," boasted the

firm which installed the air-conditioning system.) The State's strong but sub-
dued Art-Deco  (a phrase not yet coined)

architectural motifs would bolster preserva-

tionists' successful attempts to save it from

the wrecking ball sixty years later.24

Increasing traffic on area roads during the

interwar years caused Lee Highway to be

widened to three lanes. Trees, long a major
concern in Falls Church, became a con-

tentious issue when the state highway depart-
ment announced plans to cut all the shade

trees lining Broa.d Street as part of its widen-
ing. As community opposition to the trccs
removal grew, even the Parent-Teacher
Association became involved-on the side of

the trees,  of course.  Henry G.  Shirley,  state

commissioner of highways,  issued Falls
Church an ultimatum: it could have its shade trees, or it could have a new

forty-foot road. The need to rebuild Broad Street took precedence over the
trees, which were said to be reaching the cnd of their life spans. The state high-
way department replanted the rebuilt Broad Street with pin oaks and Chinese

elms,  so Falls Church and Henry Shirley both won.25

In September  1938 a family which was to become renowned moved to the
home later known as Tallwood on East Broad Street: Milton S.  Eisenhower and

his wife,  Helen.  Di..  Eisenhower, the elder brother of Dwight D. Eisenhower,
was a high-ranking official in President Roosevelt's administration and was
known and envied for his access to the president, with whom he dined alone

frequently.26

Coming world events were to influence Falls Church and the Eisâ¬nhowers

in ways which no one could have ima.gincd. The era of peaceful prosperity was

drawing to a close.

Mobiltz;ation and a
Second Tmorld Tmar

E rope was at war as America, still at pcacc,  cclebratcd Thanksgiving in

941.  Falls  Church's  First Church of. Christ,  Scientist,  held a `special  service
in which the text of the day was Psalms  50: 14-15-"Offer unto God

thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the m{)st High; and call upon mc in  the

day of trouble  .  .  ." The Christian Scientists and their fellow townspeople
would have been chagrined to lean how quickly they might have opportunity

to  request Divine help. I

The  bombing on  December 7,1941,  of the U.S.  Paciflc Fleet in  Pearl

Harbor,  Hawaii caused something of a panic.  One Falls Church resident cross-
ing Key Bridge into Washington December 8, the day after Pearl Harbor

noticed anti-aircraft guns hastily mounted and manned along the Georgetown
shore of the Potomac River.2

Preparations for war began immediately in Falls Church and Fair fax

County, of which the town was then still a part. The county's draft board
resumed physical  examinations  of all potential draftees.3

Consumer rationing and salvage efforts became the way of life in the area.

Rubber for automobile tires quickly became in short supply as the Japanese
assumed control of the great rubber plantations of Southeast Asia, and a

county tire rationing board was established shortly after the new year.4

As the rubber shortage became "increasingly acute"  the county rationing

I)oard obtained the draconian  power to order private vchiclcs  needing tire

scrvicing off the  roads.S

Soon  to  follow were strict rationing controls  for gasoline,  shoes,  farm

machinery  (including t)arbcd wire),  long-distance  telephone service,  stoves,

fat,  sugar,  coffee,  and processed  foods.6 Even  milk became scarce  in Virginia

during  1943.7  "Don't be a fat-waster!,"  Falls Church  inhabitants were  urged.
"Two pounds of waste  kitchen  fats contain  enough  glycerine  to  fire  5  anti-

tank guns  shells."8

The county Red Cross, headquartered in Falls Church, established a

visible presence early in the war, running frequent and highly successful cam-

paigns to collect "life-saving plasma for the Army and Navy," usually in Falls
Church Presbyterian Church.`' The Falls Church branch of the Red Cross
County Canteen Corps served breakfasts to Fair fax County men inducted into

the  armed scrviccs.10

War hysteria prompted Falls Church's town council to enact protcctivc
measures quickly. The town council chartered a civilian defense committee
which was to assist in managing the after-effects of an enemy attack on
Washington, including policing,  trafflc control, directing rcfugces, and report-

ing sabotage or cspionagc.11

Air raid wardeiis were appointed and Fair fax County's air raid warden

headquarters wcrc cstabli`shed in the Falls Church Police  Station.  By  1943  Falls

Church's aircraft ottservation post, at dakwood Cemctcry, was staffed 24 hours

a day,  7 days a week,  by 350 volunteer observers.  Occasiomlly local air raid

The Fair fax County Board of Supervisors enacted a blackout ordinance in

February  194213  and the first total  blackout took place in April. Three prison-

ers attempted to escape the county jail during the twenty-minute blackout.14

Virginia's governor ordered blackout drills monthly in at-risk areas, including

the District of Columbia it did not necessarily take part in blackouts mandated

by Richmond.16 The county's practice record was not good:  drills as late as

June  1942 earned caustic reports.17

News of the allied invasion of enemy-occupied Europe in  1944 was greeted

warmly in Falls Church, where churches held commemorative services and

rang bells  in  unison.18 Advertisers,  ever in time with  current events,  responded

by fllling local papers with jingoistic language  ("How's your invasion going?

HIS  seems  to  be doing all right  .  .  .  Buy your Invasion  Bonds today").HJ

General Dwight D.  Eisenhower stayed with his brother, Milton, in the lat-

ter's home, now Tallwood,  on  East Broad Street during part of the war.
Eisenhower, who worked eighteen-hour days, later wrote,  "I cannot remember

ever seeing their house in daylight during all the months I served in
Washington."  Helen Eisenhower always prepared the general a pot of cocoa
when he arrived home as it helped him to go to sleep.  During this time many
of Dwight's assignments were secret even from his wife,  Mamie, but Milton
learned his brother was Allied commander heading the invasion of North

Africa.  On November 8,1942,  the night of the invasion, Milton,  Helen, and
Mamie Eisenhower and several friends were playing cards in the Eisenhowers

recreation room.  Milton, knowing Dwight would announce the invasion by

radio at 9 p.in., kept the radio on during the

card game. After the invasion announcement
and the little group heard General Eisenhower's

personal statement,  Mamie was silent.  Milton
relates,  "Tears came to her eyes, but for a long

time she said nothing .  .  .  `Milton,  I am proud

of you for not telling me."20

Falls Church citizens,  meanwhile, were

fighting around the globe.  One local man

based in England wrote that "Every time you

wi.ite you mention a few more boys who are

going into the service. Must be hardly anybody
between eight and eighty left." Another, in
training in Texas, wrote,  "Will you please bake

me some cookies or a cake?"21  Donald M.

Moore was cited for bravery on Guadalcanal.22

Lytton H.  Gibson earned the Silver Star in

Italy.23  Charles 0. Triebel severely damaged
enemy shipping while commnding a subma-

rine, which earned him the Silver Star.24

Several others earned similar recognition. And Edward R.  Pierce of west Falls
Church arrested and imprisoned the poet Ezra Pound, who was the spokesman

of ltaly's  Fascist leader  Benito  Mussolini.25

Local leaders began drafting plans for reabsorbing returning servicemen into

the economy after the close of the war.26 Blackout and air raid regulations were

lifted with the fall of the Nazis in Europe,27 and in June  1945  German prison-

ers of war began working in Fairfax County agriculture and food processing
sites to hasten the delivery of food to  U.S.  troops in the Pacific. The Germans
worked for local  farmers until the local prisoner-of-war camp, a branch of a
much larger one at Front Royal, closed in November (much to the disappoint-

ment of the farmers).28

In August it was over.  Fair fax County and Falls Church greeted the news

surprisingly quietly.  Special church  services were held,  as on  "Invasion Day,"
and sirens were blown, and many businesses and government offlces closed the

next day.

farmland which surrounded the town and separated it from other settle-
Post-war prosperity wrought great changes to Falls Church. The ficlds and
cnts gave way to business development and residential subdivisions and,
by the close of the  1950s,  they were gone.  Seven Corners, one of the region's

flrst suburban  malls,  opened  in  1956.  "A quiet little country orchard  .  .  .  was

transformed overnight into the great Seven Corners Shopping Center,"I

according to interested observers.

A former slave, Frederick Foote,  Sr., had purchased about thirty-nine acres

from the Minor family following the Civil War with money he had earned
working as a blacksmith for Union  troops. The land was owned by his descen-

dants until they sold it for the new shopping center.

An instant success among shoppers, the new commercial complex quickly
reduced Falls Church's market territory-that is, the area from which shoppers
were drawn  to Falls Church-so that it now included only the city and areas
west of it. Tyson's Corner, an even larger retail development, which opened on
empty farmland to the west in  1966,  further reduced Falls Church's market ter-
ritory to what it is today-the City and immediately edj.acent environs.

Meanwhile,  Falls Church's business district rapidly expanded to create the
commercial "spines" that still exist-North and South Washington Street and
West Broad Street. The town's first strip shopping center opened in the  1000

block of West Broad Street (between West Street and the railroad crossing)  in

1948. This automobile-oriented strip center, featuring buildings separated from

the strcct by parking lots for cars, proved the prototype for future development
in Falls Church,  mirroring a nationwide trend. This and other development

added enough  new businesses to the city to warrant establishment of the

Greater Falls Church Chamber of commerce in  1946.2

An unpleasant consequence of the area's newfound reliance on the automo-

bile was the widening of washington and Broad Streets from two lanes to four
and five lanes, which necessitated cutting the shade trees lining both thorough-

fares.  Citizens objected, but the rapidly increasing population of both the
town-and city-which increased from 2,576 in  1940 to 7,535 in  1950, and
10,192 in  1960-as well as in the surrounding areas made the widcnings nec-

essary to accommodate all  the new cars plying roadways.  But this time the state

highway department did not replant the trees. West Broad Street remained bar-

ren of trees until the  1990s. And Washington Street remains unplanted. The

fate of the trees  lining these  two streets has been  a recurring question  in  town

and city life as  "growth and progress  issues"  such as strcct widenings  have

caused the  trees to be cut and replanted several  times.

Infrastructure,  in hand with the broader roadways,  made physical expan-

sion of the city possible.  Donald S.  Frady, legendary director of public works,

and his staff installed six miles of sidewalks,  twenty miles of curbs and gutters,

and many thousands of feet of storm drains within ten years of the city's cre-

ation  in  1948.3

Civic groups, the equally vital component
of any cohesive city, continued to be formed or
strengthened in post-war years. The League of
Women Voters and several neighborhood groups
representing Greenway Downs, Broadmont,  and
northern Falls Church were active in governmental

affairs, and Jaycees, Kiwanis, Lions, Veterans of
Foreign Wars, American Legion, and Boy and

Girl Scouts all provided fraternal and charitable

activities.4

During this time Falls Church inhabitants
came under the influence of two nonpartisan citi-
zens' organizations rather than of the Republican

or Democratic political parties. This was done to
comply with the provisions of the Hatch Act,
which barred federal employees from being spon-
sored by national political parties for elective

office.  Much of Falls Church's population is feder-
ally employed. The Hatch Act was recently amend-
ed to remove this restriction but Falls Church vot-

ers,  loyal to the Citizens for a Better City (CBC),
the Falls Church Citizens Organization  (FCCO),
or to the nonpartisan system itself, show no signs

of returning to more typical affiliations.

attempt to endorse and elect to the Council pro-school candidates.5 The

FCCO's formation followed in  1988 largely in  response to land use decisions
that were not maintaining the character of Falls Church.  Since that time the
city has generally elected members from divided tickets and independent can-

ed housing fir these new citizou.  One Â§aech

Falls Church is unique in this country for the high number of registered

voters who participate in elections.  In the  1996 national  election over 92 per-

cent of registered voters in Falls Church cast ballots. The national average is

generally near the flfty percentile.

The Town of Falls Church was separated from the County of Fair fax and

became an  independent city of the second class by District Court order in
1948. The city's charter was granted' by the General Assembly in  1950.

Schools in Falls Church became a top priority. When the new city assumed

control of the schools from Fair fax in  1949-50, almost immcdiatcly a modern-
ization and rebuilding program was begun with a difference of opinion. To
many in the new city it seemed an extravagant use of public monies for capital

improvements and for "frills" such as music and art programs.  But to the high-

ly educated, mostly federal employees who were driving the modernization

push,  it seemed a wise use of tax dollars. The pro-modernization side won the
argument but only after more than  a decade of law suits and protracted, bitter

and divisive city elections producing radically different councils as control see-

sawed between the two sides.6

The city's independence from  Fair fax County in  1948 left it without a
high school, adequate elementary school space, and with Fair fax County
schools within its borders. This somewhat unsettled state of affairs continued
for many years, with the Falls Church High School in Falls Church attended

by Fairfax County students.  Falls Church's own junior-`senior high school,

which opened in  1952 just across the city boundary on land purchased in the
county before the annexation sul( was ]as(, was named after Vlrrinia statesman
George Mason, a name chosen from a list which included Old Dominion,
Northwestern, Columbia, Falls Church, Thomas Jefferson. MacATthur, and
Haycock. The city requested the Falrfu County School Board to change the
mme of Falls Church High, bu( i( did no(. I( later was renamed whittler and
was razed in  I 997. M(. Daniel Elementary School, also built on land just out-
side the city limit, opened in  1952. In 1955 the Oak Street School, renamed
Thomas Jefferson Elemen(ary School, was pu[chased from Falrfax CoLinry and
the venerable Jefferson lnstifu(e, the town's first public school, was closed in
1956 and demolished in 1958. For the first several years after independence
falls Church and Fairfu Couiity exchanged students until each made ami]ge-
mcnts to accommodate its own studelits.7

Segngation played a role in Fans Church's history, as i[ did throughout the

sta(e. The Commonwealth of virginia adopted a "massive resistance" polity
toward federally-directed desqpngation mcasLires in education until  1959. Falls
Church insrfuted mixed-race education two years ]a(er, in  1961, two years
behind neighboring Arlington, which instituted jt in  1959. Prior to that date
the city paid tuition to send its black elemen(ary

pupils to Fajrfax County's James I.ee Elementary
School on Annandale Road, and its black high
school pupils (o school in Mamssas.8

Separation of the races `mas also evidem in res-

idential alitas. Neighborhood covenants in some
sections of the city forbade owners from selling
their homes (o persons "of negro or negroid
descen( in aLny dngree . . ." These covenaJ)ts were
observed until  1948 when the U.S. Supreme
CouT( ruled (hem unconstitutional.9 Affican-
Americans continue to be counted among Falls
Church's notable citizens and Tinncr Hill, settled
by blacks after the Civil War, is home to descen-
dants of those oririnal families today, including
the Tinncrs and the HendeTsons.10

Recorlf trming VIllage Roots

Ihe powerful  forces of a particular brand of prosperity, progress,  and

rough the  1970s were often disrespectful of history and architecture.  In

Falls Church, lovely old homes lining North and South Washington Street and

dernization, seen in Falls Church and across the country from the  1950s

Broad Street were razed, as were the I.O.O.F.  (International Order of odd

Fellows)  Hall, Jefferson Institute,  Falls Church Bank,  Columbia Baptist

Church, and other visual and cultural landmarks in the local streetscape. They

were often replaced by architecturally undistinguished structures of predomi-

nantly utilitarian design.

But Falls Church,  finding itself at the crossroads represented by unbridled

change and tempered, selective change, chose the latter. Many jurisdictions did
not.  In  1962 planners recommended apartment towers for East Broad and
North Washington Streets. The City, after measured debate, disagreed.  In  1964

planners recommended turning downtown into an  "experimental" pedestrian
mall. This ambitious plan was in process for ten years and was formally pre-

sented in  1974. Apartment and commercial towel.s were to line the streets. The

plan is easy to dismiss now, since it was not undertaken, but numerous other

jurisdictions did  undertake similar redevelopment schemes.  Ma.ny features of
similar  1970s  urban redevelopment plans failed.I

But nothing in Falls Church's history threatened it as immediately and

physically as the interstate highway network, an outgrowth of the amazing

post-war economic prosperity in which  it shared.

President Dwight D.  Eisenhower announced plans for an interstate high-

way system  in  1956;  the Washington area segment called  for nine radial corri-

dors and three circumferential highways (beltways)  centered on Washington,

with five new Potomac RIver bridges.2 One such radial corridor, later designat-

ed Interstate  (or "I")  66, was to link the Shenandoah Valley to  the capital.`3

Falls Church lent its support to this monumental effort.  In  1955,  fully a

year and a half before the Virginia Highway Commission formally proposed 1-
66, the City Council recommended that the road be built and that the City bc

on  its  right of way.4 Additional  details caused  the council  to  rescind its early

approval:  by  1958 plans called for the new highway to pass through the City of
Falls Church along the right of way of the Washington  8c Old Dominion

Railroad.5 Its eight lanes and associated rights of way would form a corridor

300-500 feet wide.  Its interchanges would consume approximtcly [hirry acres
each.6 Over forty homes and forty businesses would be eliminated.7

The impact of this proposal-eradicating the entire West End business dis-

trict and many of the city's historic homes and residential areas-was not lost
on the council, which lobbied to have the proposed route shifted.  In  1959 the

director of the Northern Virginia Planning District Commission assured Falls
Church  residents that the route would now pass north of the city.8

Falls Church's narrow escape proved to be the opening chapter of a com-

plex story.  In Arlington,  environmentalists,  unable to  block construction

143

entirdy, caused the proposed higivay, Irfe6,
to be scaled back from eight lanes to four,
with portions below grade aTid with cmen-
sivc ]andscaping and sound barriers.9 In East
faJ]s Church, separated from the rest of
Falls Church in  1936, businesses virtun]Jy
ceased to exist after lrfe6 made its local

appearance. Many residences and its com-
mercial district, which included a movie
theater, barber shop, stores, a post office,
and doc(ors offices, were almos( en(irdy sac-
rificed to make way for the new in(erstate
higivay.'Â° Falls Church. itself no longer

physically thTca(ened by the higliway route,
was still kcenJy in(crested in the issue. City
officials viewed the new highway as a bypass
arotind the tTafficcholnd (owii. "Perhaps
Falls Church's most obvious curse is traffic,"
said one, hcanily endorsing the roadway. 8 I
Balancing the needs of automobile traps-

pomtion against the quality of life incmasingiv consumed public debate jn
Falls Church as i( adjusted to exis(once in a rapidly-burgeoning urban aJca.

Falls Church's downto\rm became less intimate than before when the streets
which in(crscct there were widened (o four and five lanes. Overhead pedestriai]
walkways vere recommended for (hc intersection of Broad and Wching[on
Streets by a consultan( who noted in  1967, "It's worth your life to try (o cross
there on foot."12 Bu( Falls Church, tl]rough carrful stroe( ornamentation ai]d
cmsswalk trca(ment, has managed to preserve its downtown as a place where

Tcstau[an( patrons dine ourdoors and residents and visitors interact.

Suburbs, as Gertrude Stein said, are the place where "there is no A4|rir
there."13 "Falls Church may be a city by name and a metropo]i(all subul
by locale, l]ut it has the hcalt and soul of a vi]]agr," according to one life-

President John  F.  Kennedy was quick to cable,  "Warmest congratulations

to  Falls  Church, Virginia,"  in  1962  as  the city learned that its progressive civic

program sccurcd it the AIl-America City award from the National Municipal
League and foo4 magazine. The city showed "noteworthy accomplishments
through alert, continuing citizen pa.rticipation.  Such is the only way to make

self-government effective," according to contest judges, who praised the city's

nonpartisan  atmosphere.16

One of the most effective protectors of the village legacy has been the Falls

Church Village Preservation and Improvement Society (VPIS), the  1965  suc-

cessor to  the  1885-1919 Village Improvement Society.  It was a VPIS  study

which originally suggested replanting trees on Broad Street,  and its work in

preserving the tree canopy, conserving the stream valleys,  and encouraging judi-
cious landscaping using native plant species has been  invaluable in preserving

the city's natural character.  Its popular concerts in Cherry Hill Park and in
homes around the city have added immeasurably to the cultural milieu.

"The beautiful historic homes

and sites we enjoy today have a

way of becoming gas stations,
hamburger stands, and high-rises
that we must endure tomorrow,"
wrote Stewart W.  Edwards of
Historic Falls Church,  Inc.,  a
nonprofit corporation formed in

1975  to encourage  restoration and

administer preservation Case-

ments.17 In  1984  the Council

enacted a zoning ordinance desig-

nating the entire city as an his-

toric overlay district,  giving

homes and buildings built in or

before  1910 special protection
from demolition.  Remembrance

and preservation of the past are

essential ingredients in the life of

any village.

iumcrous examples of user-friendly services  in practically every Falls
Church city government department.  Helpful staff members make con-
Efective government involves clear understanding of expectations. There are

tacts pleasant even when they include paying taxes.

Joint ventures are shared with  neighboring jurisdictions. The city govern-

ment cooperates with the Arlington County government in providing commu-
nity-based group homes for court-sponsored programs for teenage boys a.nd

girls who need emphasis on personal responsibility,  independent judgment, and

positive change. Argus House,  on Clarendon Boulevard in Arlington, opened
in  1976 and Aurora House on South Maple Avenue in Falls Church opened on

April 7,1991. The Friends of Argus and Aui.ora Houses support extra projects

and the Susan L.  0lom Scholarship Fund encourages house residents to attend

college.I

Through the Housing and Human Services Division, programs are provid-

ed for families,  senior citizens,  people with disattilities and residents  in crisis.

These and other services are available from the city or in cooperation with

Arlington or Fair fax counties.2

Priorities had been strongly established after the circuit court judge granted

Falls Church city of the second class status in  1948 and the General Assembly

granted its charter in  1950. The city built two schools:  George Mason Junior-
Senior High School west of Haycock Road, and Mount Daniel Elementary at
the end of Oak Street; both were opened in  1952. The City purchased Oak

Street School from Fair fax County in  1955  and renamed it Thomas Jefferson
Elementary School. All school buildings had subsequent additions and renova-

tions. The first section of the brick city hall was opened in  1958,  as was  the

flrst section of the library building.J So were schools, government, and the

library served.

All of the Falls Church public schools and one private school have been

nationally recognized as exemplary learning centers. In  1982-83, George

Mason High School received one of the first Excellence in Education awards
from the United States Department of Education. Mount Daniel and Thomas

Jefferson Elementary Schools received the Excellence in Education award in
1986,  a.nd  in  1998,  George Mason Middle School  received a Blue RIbbon

award for excellence in education. Also in  1998, the Virginia Tech/University
of virginia Northern Virginia Center on Haycock Road formed a partnership
with George Mason High and Middle Schools for a technology learning

center.4 The only private school in Northern Virginia to receive the award that

year, St. James Catholic School in Falls Church, was named a Blue Ribbon
School for  1998-99 by the U.S.  Department of Education.  It was one of the
Blue Ribbon Schools named nationwide for the school year and was cited for
"academic excellence, parental involvement and community support." The

school population in  1998-99 at St. James Catholic School,  kindergarten

through eighth grade, was 625.5

Schools have had an important place in the Falls Church community for
decades. As Falls Church Public School Supcrintendcnt Mary Ellen Shaw wrote

in  1999:

Since its inception in  1949,  the  Falls Church City  inde|iendent School

systenii has  prodeced a concrete measure of its excellence in the form of a

coritinttous Â§tredm of well-edrcated graduates ...,  Buildings  have  been

renovated and new Staff hired.  Neu) I)rograms  have  been introdaeced, Xerox

machines, VCRs and com|)uteri  have replaced Pur|]le ditto md$1;ers, film

Strip |]rojectorÂ§ and typeu)riterÂ§.  But one thing htts remained the Sdme-the

commitment of the commiAnity drid the Â§tÂ¢ff to  provide the  best possible

education to all of the Students in the  Pal:lÂ§ Church City I>ttblic Schools.6

In  the  initial  1998-99  city budget,  the schools'  appropriation  amounted  to

S 14,246,683,  74.50 percent of the total city budget.  Appropriations for school

purposes have traditionally represented a high percentage of the annual budget
for Falls Church. The public school population for  1998-99 was  1,062 stu-

dents for kindergarten through eighth grade, and 505 students for ninth

through twelfth grades.7

Since the Falls Church Community Center was opened in  1968  under the

direction of Ken Burnett,  it has filled a large variety of needs for the city and
its environs throughout the year and offered numerous opportunities for the

constructive use of leisure time. The center,  now under director Howard
Herman,  hosted citizens' groups, health groups, scout groups, athletic clubs,

military historians, recyclcrs, the Victorian Society, and garden clubs, some of

the organizations that met in  1999 in the Community Center on a regular
basis.  Other special events were held in the Community Center's large gymna-
sium and in Cherry Hill park.9

In  1999,  the city of Falls Church was named a Tree City USA for the

twenty-first year in a row.  Under the direction of arborist Shirley Street,  the
successful program meets four requirements: a community tree board or

depa.rtment, a tree care ordinance, a comprehensive community forestry pro-

gram, and an Arbor Day observance.  National sponsors of the Tree City USA
program are the Arbor Day Foundation, the Forest Service,  and the Association
of State  Foresters.1Â°

The recycling program in Falls Church began in the  1970s when the city
became the first in the region to offer curbside recycling of newspapers to the

residents. With the establishment of the "green bin"  program in  1990 and the
Falls Church Recycling Center in  1991, a wide variety of materials is now col-
lected on a regular basis.  Citizen volunteer involvement and youth education

programs reaching hundreds of elementary school students have provided
opportunities to take part in environmental awareness and action in the com-
munity.  In  recognition of its strong recycling program,  Falls Church is one of

only nineteen communities across America to be included in an EPA docu-

rrLâ¬ITt, Cutting tlJe VmaÂ§te Stream in  Halfi  Community Record Setters Show  Hou).

After using open dump sites and a sanitary land fill established by Fair fax
County in  1973, Falls Church has relied on Fair fax County for disposal of its

solid waste.  Nearly all such material collected in  the city is  now incinerated at

the I-95  Energy/Resource Recovery Facility in  Lorton.1l

Vice President Albert Gore issued a National Recycling Challenge on

November  16,1998, asking citizens to renew their commitment to conserve

our national  resources by recycling.  Under the City's Recycling Coordinator,

Annette Mills, and with active and enthusiastic citizen participation, Falls

Church received the nation's highest rating-67 percent a year later in  1999,
forty points above the national average.

As City Manager Louis  Z. Johnston, Jr.  wrote in  1961 :

.  .  It is on the basis of its contribution to the chanlcter of the city ac
a;h.Ore-;;;;;;;;;;;:;;;t-:;;;if`;;';;';;;;i;;:;;i;';;;i;;.i::[;'6;#fJrto
be a great city in the sense of Square miles occapied.  But Falls Church  can

be, and is u)ell on its u)ay to  becoming, a great city in the sense of offering

a fine Place in which to  live and u)orb. The city is match more than its

government:  it is homes, churches,  organizations dedicated to Â§erulce,  and
businesses operated efficiently yet u)ith a strong Sense of the |>ttblic interest;

it is the way in which neighbors and even rivals work together in common

PurpeÂ§e.  But a SenÂ§e Of udlue and of civic |jurpose cannot operate withottt
the Solid foundation of good government and public service. This is the

responsibility of the City Mdndger, the Saperintenderit of Schools, and

other officials and civil Â§erudnts. W:e u)ant all our citiacns to understand

uihdt we are trying to do; to  be frond t;o Â§ttggest ujayÂ§ in which we can

Â§erue better or more economically; and to surpport our effort to mdhe FdllÂ§

Throughout history,  Falls

Church has been a crossroads, with
its people and that of the region
often  returning to a common
theme of how to maintain and
improve the movement of people

and freight from one place to

another. The Tricentennial year was
no different.  Representing the City,
Mayor David Snyder participated
in creating the Northern Virginia

2020 Plan to address the inadequa-

cy of the region's road and transit

more accessible and reducing the  reliance on cars and the resulting congestion

and pollution.

Early in  2000,  the City unveiled its  new bus  transit system which is a part-

nership of the City and Fcdcral,  State and regional government, Virginia Power

and the Metro system. The twenty-two seat electric/diesel hybrid experimental

vehicles will link residential and business areas  better to  the rail stations.  In

addition to the state-of-the-art technology, the system will operate on different

da.ily schedules to better serve  the needs of commuters,  school children,  senior

citizens,  employers  and employees. Yet again,  improving transportation is occu-

pying the minds of the City's leadership and citizens  as  it has  repeatedly
throughout the three hundred years of the community's history.

The Falls Church
Tricenteunial Celebration

In September  1992,  the Board of Directors of the Village Preservation and

Improvement Society propo.sed a commemoration of the 300th anniversary
in  1999 of the settlement of the community in  1699. This date was selected

on the basis of a verbal account of a stone bearing the date "1699" on a chim-

ney in the "Big Chimneys"  house which once stood near the present-day inter-

section of Little Falls  Road and Broad Street in  Falls Church.

The Falls Church Tricentennial Committee was selected by the City

Council in  1993  to develop plans for a year-long celebration in  1999.

Committee members appointed were Ben Birindelli, Joyce Gory, Barbara
Cram, Ron Crouch, Susan Earman,  David Eckert, Merni Fitzgerald, Edna
Frady, Rosemary Haynes Jones, John Rodock, Kieran Sharpe, and Maurice

Terman.  Staff liaisons were Diane Morse, Barbara Cordon, Deane Dierksen,
Nancy Birindelli, and Daughters of the American Revolution members Marie
Yochim and Doris Katz.  During several years of meetings a tentative schedule,

month by month, was laid out.  In  1998, a Publications Subcommittee signed a
contract with the Donning Company of virginia Beach to produce this picto-
rial history of the settlement, hamlet, village, town, and city from Indian times
through December 31,1999. Two Falls Church authors,  Bradlcy Gernand and
Nan Netherton, were chosen by Donning to research, write,  and collect graph-

ics,  a process begun  in spring  1997.

The Tricentennial Committee deemed it necessary to have a special logo

for the observance and a contest was held. The winning design was done by Pat
Algie of the City's staff. It was used on  numerous banners and printed materi-

als. Additioml ideas were developed.  More than a dozen cachet envelopes with
maps and pictures were authorized by Falls Church Postmaster Joseph

Quinones,  assisted by his staff person,  Patsy Mitchell. These individually illus-
trated envelopes were designed by artist Barbara Cram and others and specially

canceled at different times during the year for stamp collectors and other inter-

ested individuals.  Over one  thousand were sold t]n  December 31,1999,

Tricentennial Eve. This was the first time the U.S.  Postal service had produced

such a series with special cancellations.

Other souvenirs included ceramic crocks marked with ``Falls Church"  and
the number "300", designed by potter Walt Zotter. Wallets filled with printed

play money were negotiable with various local merchants.  Golf shirts and pins
were also available for sale.  Sets of free bookmarks wcrc printed with brief his-

tories of individual schools or churches and made available at the public

library.  Historic maps of the city were designed, printed, and distributed free to

residents  and visitors.

Many individuals and groups gave time,  talent, and imagination  to the

planning and implementation of the year's numerous cvcnts.  In addition to the
leadership of the Tricentennial Committee, the following organizations partici-

pated:  the Historical Commission, the Village Preservation and Improvement
Society,  the Victorian  Society at Falls  Church,  the Falls  Church Public Schools,

169

the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation,  the City Manager's offlce and other City
offices, the Library Board,  Daughters of the American Revolution,  Recreation
and Parles,  neighborhood groups, the Grcatcr Falls Church Chamber of
Commerce,  the Economic Development Authority, the Police Department, the
American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars veteran's organizations, several

civic organizations,  and merchants of good will. The efforts of all participants

helped to produce memorable shared experiences among the citizens of Falls

Church, their children,  and guests during the Tricentennial year of 1999.

Festivities began on New Year's Eve,  December 31,1998, an unusually

cold and windy night. The "Crossroads in  History,"  Broad and Washington
Streets,  informally dubbed "Timeless Square"-were transformed into a pedes-
trian walkway as through traffic was rerouted around the area. Thousands of

celebrants, all bundled up, enjoyed music and other entertainment as they vis-

ited busincsses and churches whose doors had been opened for the occasion,

some with historical displays. An outdoor stage was used by music groups.

Restaurants and street vendors provided hot and cold drinks and welcome
warm food.  During the month of January  1999 which followed,  both the Falls

Church Chamber Orchestra and the U.S.  Navy Ba,nd presented special con-
certs in the George Mason High School auditorium.

The January theme of "Crossroads in History" was followed by the
February theme of "Government." Two Leadership Round Tables were held,
one at George Mason High and the other in the Council Chamber at City
Hall. The 50th Anniversary of the City Schools was commemorated with a
special music program presented by the fourth and fifth grades, at George

Mason  High auditorium. At the City's first "Harambce" celebration in
February, Black History month was recognized in an appropriate way.  It was

announced that City Council members had repealed by resolution on February
22,1999, the segregation ordinance which had been passed by the Town

Council in  1915  in  an effort to separate races  into different residential areas

within the corporate limits. A City Hall Open House extended a special invita-

tion to citizens  to visit local government offices.

Special recognition of the importance of "Volunteers and Organizations"

was given in March honoring the more than sixty active civic and church

groups in the City. An organizational Information Fair was held at the
Kemper-Macon Ware Masonic Lodge No.  64 in mid-March and included the

presentation of a special bust of virginia colonial statesman George Mason to
the city to be placed in front of City Hall. AIl schools observed one Old

Fashioned Day at City schools and the first grades gave a 50th anniversary

presentation of the schools musical program at George Mason High.

April was the month to celebrate "Natural and Cultural  Resources." The
first Falls Church Arbor Day-first in the state of virginia as well-was held at
the Jefferson Institute in  1892. The commemorative observance was held near

the old site in Frady Park. The  100th anniversary of the Mary RIley Styles  Falls

Church Library was celebrated on April  18 with speakers, birthday cakes, bal-
loons, and flowers. A youthful bagpiper and an enthusiastic Barber Shop

Quartet performed in appropriate costumes. The Cherry Hill Fa.rm House
offered special tours featuring the life of Mary RIley Styles.

"History on Parade" was the theme for May.  Civil War Living History

groups demonstrated at the Thoma.s Jcffcrson School's playing ficld. And at a
dedication of Civil War Trails by the City Council, "Fort Taylor" Park at Seven

Corners was officially recognized as a significant location on  the Virginia Civil

War Trails map.  It commemorates the first use of balloons at that site during

the Civil War under the direction of Professor Thaddeus Lowe for purposes of

costumes enhanced a Victorian Ball held at Thomas Jefferson School and a spe-
cial tea was given at Cherry Hill Farm House. A few days later, the Falls
Church Chamber Orchestra presented a concert at George Mason High.  In

addition to other selections, a special work commissioned and written in honor
of the Tricentennial by composer Thomas Schouber was given its inaugural

performance. The final public event of the month was the annual Memorial
Day Parade,  the 3-K Fun Run, and all-day activities in the City Hall-Cherry
Hill Complex.  Falls Church civic leader Louis Olom was designated the Grand

Marshal of the parade.

The theme chosen by the Tricentennial committee for June was

"Celebration of People." The Tinner Hill Street Festival celebrated the African-

American community and their cultural activities. Also, a large crowd was in
attendance that month to honor Deane Dierksen at her retirement party at
Cherry Hill for her service to the community as director of the Mary Riley

Styles Public Library of Falls Church. An elaborate reenactment of an actual
Victorian wedding was held t]y the Victorian Society at the Abbott house with

almost one hundred "guests"  in costumes of the period. Music was played and
elaborate refreshments were served under the ancient shade trees on the lawn.

Later that month, school afflliations were remembered with reunions and pic-
nics for both the George Mason High School alumni and the public school
staff with several teachers attending who taught at Madison School in  1949. A
large reunion for the classes in the  1960s was held at the State Theater and an

all-class picnic at Cherry Hill Park was held on Saturday, June 26.

A broad definition of "Recreational Pursuits" served as July's central theme.

On July 4, The Falls Church  (Episcopal)  held a special colonial church service
followed by an audience participation in the reading aloud by many individuals

of the original wording of the Fair fax Resolves, the Virginia Declaration of

RIghts, the Declaration of Independence, and the Federal Bill of Rights. A fire-
works show was given that evening at George Mason High's athletic field.

During July a.nd part of August, outdoor evening concerts sponsored by the
Village Preservation and Improvement Society were held in Cherry Hill Park
behind the old barn. The audiences, many of them families with children,
brought blankets and chairs or sat on the grass under the trees to enjoy the
"music in the air." A special program was held in July commemorating one of

two District of Columbia Jurisdiction Stones located on Falls Church's borders.
The No. 9 Boundary Stone near Van Buren Street had been declared a
National Registered Landmark in  1980 and was mmed after the black mathe-
matician and astronomer,  Benjamin Banneker, who assisted Andrew Ellicott in

laying out the entire ten-mile-square encompassing land in Maryland, the
District of Columbia, and Vlrginia. The other stone is the West Cornerstone
located at the joining of Arlington County,  Fair fax County, and the City of
Falls Church on Meridian Street. This stone has been recently named, by

agreement of the three jurisdictions,  in honor of Andrew Ellicott, chief survey-

or of the ten-mile-square of the  Federal  District in  1791  and  1792.  Isaac
Crossman park on Four Mile Run was also dedicated that day.

"Happy Birthday, Falls Church!" was the Tricentennial theme in August. A

well-attended public concert with the Falls Church Chamber Orchestra and
Irish dancers and a ceremonial cutting of the cake were held in Cherry Hill
Park.  On the fifteenth, a dedication of the supposed site of the "Big Chimneys"
was followed by a "Church and Tavern Day in  1763" a week later presented by
Falls Church City and organized by the Historical Commission. A meeting of

the Truro Parish Vestry was recreated around the old Anglican church and there

171

were many purveyors, artisans, and colonial period reenactors.  Gingerbread

and root beer were served and George Washington himself made an appearance
in a.n appropriate costume.  Gathering and mingling among the visitors were

story tellers,  musicians, dance masters,  toba.cco farmers, leather workers, gun-

smiths, weavers, wood crafters, blacksmiths, herbalists, quilters, sampler mak-

ers,  embroiderers, and Native American traders.

In September, following the traditional summer vacations, students

returned to school and business people geared up for their fall and holiday

activities. The month's theme was "City Schools and Businesses." The quilters

took their Bill of Rights quilt to a Council meeting to have it rededicatcd and
arranged to have it permanently mounted on display in the Council Chamber.
Open House was held at one of the community's oldest businesses,  Brown's
Hardware. An all-day Falls Church  Fa,ll Festival was held in Cherry Hill Park
on the eighteenth. The Falls Church Chamber Orchestra held its third
Tricentennial concert at George Mason High the following day. The month
ended with  the meaningful dedication of Tinner Hill Memorial Arch in a

pocket-park at the corner of South Washington Street and Tinner Hill.  It was
the culmination of persistent efforts by members of the Tinnâ¬r Hill Memorial
Foundation, the Falls Church City Council, elected government representa-

tives, other individuals, merchants, and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. A matching grant from the Commonwealth
of virginia, obtained largely through the efforts of Falls Church's Delega.te
Robert Hull, helped to fund the building of the pink marble arch. This struc-
Cure was to commemorate the founding of the flrst rural chapter of the
NAACP in the United States. The chapter was organized in  1915  in the Town
of Falls Church.  Land on Tinner Hill has been set aside by Falls Church and
Fair fax County for a future cultural heritage center.

The October theme was "Homes and Hearth." A two-day Private Homes

Tour of eleven buildings and one garden was held the first weekend in
October, sponsored by VPIS and the Victorian Society. The following weekend
there was a well-attended Farm Day at Cherry Hill Park. An exhibit of
Victorian clothing took place at Cherry Hill. A Family Sock Hop da,nce was
held at George Mason High.  Cherry Hill  Farm House was the location for lit-
erary evenings of readings to commemorate the  100th anniversary of the
founding of the Falls Church Library.

"Places of worship" was the major theme in November. An ecumenical

religious service was held on Veterans'  Day, November  1 I  at which time a

Veterans' Honor Roll Plaque was unveiled with lists of names of all of the com-
munity's service people who lost their lives in the nation's wars.  Information for

this plaque was painstakingly collected by a number of dedicated community
activists. An annual tradition was repeated during Thanksgiving week-the
showing of the classic  1946 film,  "It's a Wonderful Life," starring James

Stewart, at the Community Center. Local schools received close attention in a
November symposium entitled "The Future of Education."

"The City of the Future" was December's theme and a leadership Round

Table on the subject was held on December 7 in the newly remodeled State
Theater.  Entertainment began early in the evening with the classic rock and

roll sounds of the David Elliott Band. Then a panel of experts on the local
economy, design and development trends,  the environment, dcmographics and

government voiced their opinions on the future of Falls Church over the next
century. A Holiday Ball was held at the Community Center on  December  I 1
and on New Year's Eve,1999, a closing ceremony of the Tricentennial Year was

held in "Timclcss Square" at the City's main crossroads with merriment and

172

music. All that remained to be completed in the formal observance were two
things.  One was the dedication of a new plaque by the Village Preservation and
Improvement Society in the I'resident's Garden under the W & OD  Bike Trail
Bridge in the West End of the City off Broad Street naming and honoring past

presidents of the Society. The other task was to work with collecting certain
objects for a Time Capsule commemorating the Tricentennial Year. The kinder-

garten students in the class of 2012 were asked to participate with the preserv-
ing of the capsule at Mount Daniel Elementary School and marking it with a

plaque directing that it be opened in  the year 2050.

There are more than  forty memorials, plaques, and historical markers
which have at different times been placed throughout the City of Falls Church.
Some of the parks and streets have special names. They commemorate people,

events, buildings,  and early sites of importance in the growth and development
of the community. A current list may be seen in the Local History Room of
the Mary RIley Styles Library of Falls Church.

Bradley E.. Gernand is a native of Antlers, Oklahoma, a small town in the beautiful

but rugged Kiamichi Mountains of the Choctaw Nation. His childhood spent among
the Choctaw prompted his early interest in history. He has served as archivist
in the National Archives and is now a senior archivist in the Library of Congress, and is
a U.S. Navy officer in the reserve. He holds degrees from the University of Oklahoma.
Gernand moved to Falls Church in 1990, where he serves on the library board of
trustees and has served on the historical commission and Falls Church Jaycees. He is the
next-door neighbor of Robert Pogorzelski Matthews, a lifelong resident of Falls Church,
who graciously tended to Gernandâs many outdoor chores, without being asked, to pro-
vide the coauthor additional time in which to work on this bookâââthe embodiment of

what makes Falls Church unique among places,â according to Gernand.

Nan Netherton was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in a tiny village called
Ozone in the Tennessee mountains. She and her husband Ross and their children set-
tled in the Falls Church area in 1951.

Deeply interested in history during her academic years, she valued the opportuni-
ties which brought her to Northern Virginia. Historian for ten years in the Fairfax
County Office of Comprehensive Planning, she has written, been coauthor or has been
senior editor of more than 35 published monographs and books on Northern Virginia's
rich local history.

Nan served for several years on the board of directors of the Friends of Cherry Hill
Foundation. She holds academic degrees from the University of Chicago and George

Mason University.
