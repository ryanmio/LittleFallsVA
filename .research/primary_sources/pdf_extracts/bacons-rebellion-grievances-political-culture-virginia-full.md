 Seventeenth-Century Virginia

 first of the warships bearing the thousand or more soldiers that
 King Charles II sent to Virginia to suppress Bacon's Rebellion and
 the three commissioners he sent to ascertain its causes arrived at the

 end of January 1677 - January 1676 by the old calendar. By then the rebel-
 lion had collapsed, and Nathaniel Bacon, its namesake leader, was dead of
 dysentery and other loathsome afflictions. Governor Sir William Berkeley
 and men loyal to his administration had rounded up most of the remaining

 leaders, and Berkeley had tried them before courts martial and hanged them.

 He had put down the largest and most violent uprising of white people that
 took place in any of England's North American colonies before the one

 that began exactly a century later. He was old, tired, angry, partially deaf, and

 very perplexed at how such a bloody rebellion could have broken out in the
 colony that he had governed with success for twenty-six of the previous
 thirty-four years - almost 40 percent of its entire history. Berkeley was a

 bitter man when he climbed aboard the flagship of the fleet to greet the com-

 missioners and the commanders of the force that arrived too late to help.

 He knew one of the commissioners: Francis Moryson had lived in

 Virginia in the 1640s during Berkeley's first administration as governor, was
 speaker of the House of Burgesses in 1656, compiled one of the first print-
 ed digests of the colonial laws, sat on the governor's Council early in the
 1660s during Berkeley's second administration, and was acting governor of
 the colony from the spring of 1661 to the autumn of 1662. In 1677, though,

 Moryson was the kings agent and no longer the governors ally. The other
 two commissioners had no personal knowledge of Virginia and were
 strangers to Berkeley. Sir John Berry was a career naval officer and com-

 mander of the fleet that the king sent to Virginia, and Col. Herbert Jeffreys

 was a career army officer and the commander of the regiment that the king
 also sent.1

 Berkeley got on poorly with them. The commissioners brought the
 king's order summoning the governor back to London to report to him in

 person and empowering Jeffreys to supplant Berkeley as lieutenant governor.

 The old governor may have interpreted that as a royal rebuke or statement
 of no confidence. Berkeley did not leave for three months, until well after
 his relationship with the commissioners had deteriorated to exchanging
 insults, some veiled, some not. He was frustrated and angry about everything
 that had happened since the previous spring, and he soon grew frustrated

 and angry about the officious behavior of the commissioners, who under-
 mined his authority and issued orders as well as asked questions. Berkeley's
 deafness made his initial discussions with the commissioners difficult. They

 had to shout at him to be heard, and like many hearing-impaired people,
 he probably shouted at them, too, unaware of how he sounded to them.
 They acted as if angry with each other even before they were.2

 When Berkeley met with the commissioners aboard the king's warship
 on the first day of February, he read through the voluminous papers and

 royal instructions that they brought, and on the next day he wrote a long and

 detailed account of his handling of the rebellion for the information of his

 king and of his king's ministers. On the third day of the month, the gover-
 nor addressed a letter to each of the twenty county sheriffs, sending them the

 commissioners' request that they "make enquiry after the aggreivances of his

 Majesties Subjects in Virginia to rectify the said abuses, administring equity
 to every man without respect of persons, and to report the same to His

 Maj estie."3

 The commissioners also interviewed and received complaints from a sig-
 nificant number of individual Virginians about the governor's violent
 suppression of the rebellion and his rough treatment of the rebels and their
 families. Later in the spring when the commissioners prepared their
 long report - known as Samuel Wiseman's Book of Record, named for the

 commissioners' secretary whose handwritten copy survives - they included
 the texts or summaries of many of those individual complaints and inter-
 views, preserving much evidence about Berkeley's bad behavior in the
 aftermath of the rebellion; but even though the commissioners also includ-

 ed a long section that appeared to be derived from the county grievances, as
 they were called, that summary is not much more than a skeletal tabulation.

 It is extremely sketchy and misleading and omitted the most important
 parts, the testimony about conditions before the rebellion that contributed

 to the widespread violence of 1676. Officials in England who read the report

 consequently learned more than enough to condemn Berkeley for his actions

 in suppressing the rebellion, but they did not read or learn anything about
 the civil discontent that explained how and why a perceived threat from the

 Indians became a widespread revolt against the king's governor.4

 Most historians of Bacon's Rebellion have overlooked or neglected the
 county grievances. Some may have taken at face value the commissioners'

 statement that the county grievances contained no explanation for the rebel-

 lion and therefore did not regard the documents as important or read them

 carefully; or perhaps they assumed that the questions that the commission-

 ers propounded were merely leading questions that adduced nothing more
 than additional evidence of Berkeley's heavy-handed suppression of the
 rebellion. The leading narrative interpretations therefore missed or neglect-
 ed to take full advantage of a rich documentary source that preserves the

 perspectives and also the revealing language of hundreds of middling and

 lower-class white men, the very class of men who joined Bacon in rebelling.
 If the full, difficult manuscript texts of all of the county grievances, the
 majority of which have never been published, are considered in the context

 of the institutional and political history of Virginia, the important and neg-
 lected evidence that they contain about conditions in the colony on the eve
 of the rebellion and about the attitudes of people who joined the rebellion
 suggests different interpretations of the causes and of some of the episodes
 of Bacon's Rebellion.5

 Historians of Bacons Rebellion have suggested different causes and conse-

 quences for the event. Robert Beverley published the first narrative history

 in 1705 and confessed that the causes remained cloaked in mystery. A cen-

 tury after Beverley wrote, John Daly Burk likened Bacon's Rebellion to the

 American Revolution that began almost miraculously one hundred years

 after Bacons Rebellion, a romantic assumption that allowed Burk to magni-

 fy the roles that Virginia and his own patron, Thomas Jefferson, played in
 the Revolution by adducing a supposed precedent. Burk's interpretation

 influenced most of the other writers on Virginias colonial and revolutionary

 history throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.6

 Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker s Torchbearer of the Revolution: The Story

 of Bacons Rebellion and Its Leader (1940), one of the worst books on Virginia

 that a reputable scholarly historian ever published, portrayed Bacon as a

 proto-Thomas Jefferson and the rebellion as a rehearsal for the American

 Revolution. Wertenbaker repeatedly referred to Berkeley as tyrannical, dic-

 tatorial, and despised during the years previous to the rebellion without once

 citing any sources for those adjectives, which fly in the face of much of the

 evidence in the sources that he employed. He resolutely ignored other evi-

 dence in those sources that contradicted his portrayal of Bacon. Wertenbaker

 described Bacons attacks on friendly Indian tribes as great victories against
 Indian enemies and did not admit that all but one of the attacks he launched

 were against friendly Indians. Wertenbaker did not make much use of the

 county grievances and scarcely mentioned them in his bibliographical essay.7
 In what is still the best narrative of the events of the rebellion, Wilcomb

 E. Washburn, in The Governor and the Rebel: A History of Bacons Rebellion in

 Virginia (1957), exploited an abundance of manuscript material in England

 that no previous writer had consulted. He interpreted the outbreak of the

 rebellion as largely a response to Indian attacks on the frontiers. Washburn

 began his account with frontier conflicts in 1675 and did not look further

 back in time in search of other reasons than danger from the Indians that
 could have provoked people into joining Bacon in the summer of 1676.
 He did not make intensive use of the county grievances, which might have

 alerted him to some of the long-standing social discontent that undoubted-
 ly influenced those colonists. Although Washburn's work thoroughly

 discredited Wertenbaker's, it did not adequately explain the origins of
 Bacon's Rebellion.8

 Bernard Bailyn's influential 1959 article, "Politics and Social Structure in

 Virginia," blamed "a profound disorganization of European society in its
 American setting" for the occasional outbreaks of violence and the small-
 and large-scale rebellions that occurred in most of the English colonies
 during the seventeenth century Englishmen in England and in England's
 colonies shared a long tradition of rioting under stressful conditions, and

 stressful social instability and unrest persisted in Virginia, Bailyn wrote, until

 the final decade of the century, when native local elites and a few families of
 wealth and prominence were finally able to dominate both county and
 provincial governments and impose social and political stability on the lower

 orders of society.9

 Edmund S. Morgan's equally influential American Slavery, American
 Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia (1975) made some effective use of
 the county grievances in a short section on the aftermath of Bacon's
 Rebellion, which he portrayed as a logical consequence and an extreme
 example of the chronic social and political instability in the colony that
 Bailyn had described. Morgan's detailed study of seventeenth-century
 Virginia treated the unruly behavior of servants, slaves, and landless young
 men as evidence that the colony's planters and institutions of government
 were ineffective in imposing order and maintaining control.10

 Midway between the publication of Bailyn's essay and Morgan's book,

 Warren M. Billings made what is still the most thorough and careful analy-

 sis of the social structure and the nature and extent of social problems in
 Virginia at the time of Bacon's Rebellion. His 1968 doctoral dissertation
 demonstrated that indebtedness and local taxation rates produced wide-
 spread discontent, especially among the small farmers and the landless men
 in the colony. In two scholarly articles that he later published, Billings
 suggested that the development of strong parish and county governments
 weakened the central authority of the provincial government and con-
 tributed to the inability of Berkeley, his Council of State, and the General

 Assembly to ameliorate local problems or to stem the tide of revolt once it

 gained headway and drew discontented lower-class Virginians into the rebel-
 lion, ii

 While Billings was later writing a biography of the governor and compil-

 ing an edition of Berkeleys papers, he modified his belief that an accretion

 of power in the county governments was at the expense of effective political

 leadership in Jamestown. His revised view reflected the substance of several

 excellent studies that appeared beginning in the 1980s of families, commu-

 nities, and counties and of the operations of the General Assembly and other

 institutions of provincial government that disclosed that socially and politi-
 cally the colony was not so poorly served as Bailyn had suggested and
 Morgan had supposed. The new scholarship demonstrated that Bailyn erred

 in assuming that there was no class of wealthy, influential, and respectable

 native-born elites - a mini-aristocracy for Virginia - capable of overseeing

 the working classes during the decades between the death or departure of the

 first generation of leaders in the 1620s and 1630s and the 1690s. In fact,
 the colony's leading landed families handed down their property and their

 prestige from generation to generation through marriages of daughters and

 widows to ambitious immigrants, preserving but partially concealing those
 families' continuing social dominance through a succession of surname
 changes. Moreover, the colony's political institutions developed into stable

 and well-functioning organs of local and provincial administration.12

 The authors of the social and institutional studies did not offer an

 explanation for Bacon's Rebellion or provide a convincing alternative to
 Morgan's interpretation of the rebellion as a logical consequence of chronic

 unrest in the population of people who participated in the rebellion. Nor did

 they provide additional evidence for or in any way refute Stephen Saunders
 Webb's 1676: The End of American Independence (1984), which cited the
 county grievances several times but only for some compelling incidents and
 not to adduce the rebellion's causes. Webb appeared to locate the root cause

 of Bacon's Rebellion in the new empire's weak and ineffective administration
 of its overseas colonies.13

 Billings's 1968 warning not to neglect the county grievances, which he
 accurately described as "the only corpus of information about those issues

 agitating some colonists to the point of rebellion," has gone largely unheed-

 ed. Taking the county grievances seriously permits a reconsideration of the
 causes of the rebellion and the significance of some of its events and also

 offers insights into the political culture of seventeenth-century Virginia. It

 was in the interactions of men in the localities, as both Bailyn and Billings

 separately suggested, that men and women found reasons to join Nathaniel

 Bacon in the summer of 1676, although not entirely for the reasons that

 Bailyn and Morgan advanced.14

 In the decades between the meeting of the first General Assembly in
 1619 and the outbreak of Bacons Rebellion in 1676, Virginia changed
 remarkably. It became the English king's first royal colony in 1625, and its

 population increased by a factor of several times and spread over much of the

 land on both sides of the Chesapeake Bay and along the rivers as far west and
 north as the tides flowed. Two deadly Powhatan attacks in 1622 and 1644

 temporarily retarded but did not halt that expansion, and following the sec-
 ond attack the colonial government so overwhelmed the Indians that
 English-speaking Virginians cultivated their tobacco in comparative peace.

 The governors and the assembly delegated authority over many day-to-day

 matters to local military and civil officers, creating the first of the counties

 to which Berkeley sent the commissioners' request for information. In each

 county, parish vestries oversaw the religious and moral welfare of the people,

 and a county court, presided over by justices of the peace whom the gover-
 nor appointed, settled local disputes and maintained order. The county
 sheriffs served writs, arrested miscreants, collected taxes, and occasionally

 conducted elections; the clerks recorded deeds and wills and kept the coun-

 ty's public records; and the surveyors marked property boundaries and drew

 plats, guaranteeing to the tobacco planters their titles to their valuable land.

 Those parish vestries and county courts, and the comparatively prosperous
 men who sat on them, created twenty local polities and sets of leaders from

 whom the county's voters from time to time elected the county's burgesses.

 After Berkeley's decision in 1643 to have the burgesses sit apart from the

 governor and Council members in a bicameral legislature, the landowning
 tobacco planters in the House of Burgesses, supported by their neighbors
 and relatives at home and on the county courts, became the representa-

 tives of their class and their interests. Together, they and Berkeley fashioned
 public policies that promoted landownership, attempted to regulate the

 behavior of indentured and enslaved laborers, protected commerce with

 English and Dutch merchants, and sought high prices for the leaf tobacco

 that was the principal source of income for them all. In 1662 the assembly

 instituted in Virginia the old English practice of requiring the parish church-

 wardens to assemble all of the landowners every fourth year to perambulate

 their property lines, renewing marks and renewing individual and collective

 memories in order that everyone's property be known and secured.15

 By such means the owners of land, who were nearly all white and for the

 most part male, avoided disputes among themselves as much as possible and

 created a political system that reflected the social and economic systems

 and gave a measure of security and stability. As if to fortify the relationship
 between tobacco planters and the government, in 1670 the General
 Assembly adopted a law that restricted the suffrage to those "ffreeholders and

 housekeepers who only are answerable to the publique for the levies." That
 is, the assembly declared that only men who owned taxable property were

 sufficiently invested in the welfare of the country to be allowed to take part
 in its governance, just as in England where, as the new law explained,
 English laws "grant a voyce in such election only to such as by their estates

 real or personall have interest enough to tye them to the endeavour of the

 publique good."16

 Until the rebellion broke out in 1676, it had all seemed to work. The

 colony escaped most of the convulsions that plagued England during its civil

 wars, even though white Virginians experienced occasional episodes of vio-
 lence on the frontiers, persistent and annoying local problems with laborers
 of the kind that everyone had everywhere, and some frictions between
 churchmen and Puritans or Quakers. At the middle of the century some

 merchant-planters began acquiring a larger proportion of their labor force

 from the African slave trade, allowing some trading and planting families to

 prosper disproportionately; but so long as most or all of the tobacco planters
 shared the same objectives and hazards, Berkeley's policy of regulating the
 Indian trade so as to reduce chances of frontier violence and his participa-

 tion with them in the tobacco economy created what appeared to them to

 be practical and generally profitable political and economic systems.17

 The rebellion that Nathaniel Bacon led broke out early in 1676 and was a

 complete surprise, not only that it happened at all but also that it swept up

 in it a great many people in eastern Virginia - including tobacco planters,
 indentured servants and enslaved laborers, and even women - who did not

 appear to be immediately threatened by its most evident cause, which was

 fear of renewed Indian attacks on the margins of the western and northern

 settled areas. Scattered fighting between colonists and Doegs and other tribes

 on the edges of the frontier in 1675 and 1676 and receipt of news early in
 1676 of fighting in New England (known as King Philip's War) caused
 Nathaniel Bacon and other men living near the fall line of the James River

 to assemble into a martial band and begin attacking Indians and demanding

 that the governor raise a force to defend the colony. Berkeley summoned the
 General Assembly back into session in March 1676, but it could do little

 more than create a mobile army of 500 men and plan to erect and man a

 few posts on the frontier. A drought had ruined the tobacco crop, plunging

 people into debt, and taxes were already high in the colony for two reasons:

 the governor's proposal to buy out the proprietors of the Northern Neck (the

 land between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers), which the king had

 granted to a set of court favorites; and huge expenses that the governor and

 assembly had undertaken during two recent wars with the Dutch when the
 king and his ministers commanded that a large fort be built at Point
 Comfort at the mouth of the James River, a fort that could not possibly be
 of any practical use because of the breadth of the river and the shallowness
 of the near-shore water.18

 Bacon raised a volunteer army in the spring, and fighting between that

 army and the Indians, as well as threatened violence between that army and
 the government, led Berkeley to call for an election and summon a new
 assembly for June 1676. There, late in the session, he faced down Bacon in

 a dramatic scene. The governor literally bared his chest and invited the rebel

 leader to shoot him. Berkeley vacillated between trying to protect the fron-
 tier settlers and not disturb the generally peaceful trading relationships
 he had fashioned with the tribes in the interior. The June 1676 assembly

 created a thousand-man army, one-fifth of which was cavalry, and specified

 how many men each county's militia commanders were to recruit or impress

 into the service. When Bacon threatened the governor he also threatened the

 assembly members and in effect extorted from them a commission as the

 general of the new army. The law so named him, and the governor, against
 his better judgment, reluctantly agreed. "How miserable that man is,"
 Berkeley grumbled a few days after the assembly adjourned, "that Governes
 a People wher six parts of seaven at least are Poore Endebted Discontented

 and Armed and to take away their Armes now the Indians are at our Throats

 were to rayse an Universali mutiny."19

 In the end, Bacons impetuous leadership of thousands of frightened men
 overwhelmed Berkeley's irresolute prudence and plunged the colony into a
 full-scale civil war that resulted in scores or perhaps hundreds of people

 being killed and the capital city of Jamestown burned to the ground. Men
 loyal to Bacon and other men loyal to Berkeley (and some who switched
 sides) plundered their enemies' farms or ran amuck and plundered at will.

 Most surprisingly of all, once the rebellion began to gather force, men and
 women who lived far from the settlements where Indian raids were a possi-

 bility also took sides with Bacon against Berkeley's government. It appeared
 that the widespread participation of people in the rebellion involved more
 than fear of Indian attacks. But what? And how seriously were they (and are
 we) to take the implications of Bacon's public pronouncements against
 the governor to which he signed himself "General, by the consent of the

 people"?20

 Virginia politicians and imperial administrators then as well as historians

 ever since have debated the many answers that those questions produced.
 Had Samuel Wiseman's Book of Record reported on the substance and
 details of the county grievances with the same thoroughness that it reported

 on the complaints about Berkeley's actions in suppressing the rebellion, royal
 officials in the seventeenth century and historians and their readers in the

 twentieth century would have understood that important event in different

 ways. The commissioners casually dismissed the grievances contained in the

 reports from the counties as "soe few and Triviali" that they could not have

 set off the rebellion, and they shifted attention to Berkeley even before com-

 pleting the report by complaining "that if the Governour and his Party
 would leave off their depredations, and Answer to those matters hee by his

 Maj estie is Instructed and by us desired to doe, Wee can see noe urgent occa-

 sion to stay a fortnight longer upon the Place." That conclusion, which the

 commissioners reached after being in the colony for two months and
 coming to loggerheads in their dealings with Berkeley, indicates that the
 commissioners were by then inclined to blame Berkeley and his adherents
 for the colony's problems both before and after the rebellion rather than

 to blame the leaders of the rebellion for beginning it or to look and listen
 carefully for the sources of discontent. The commissioners either sup-
 pressed - or more likely missed entirely - the import of much of what the

 county grievances contained.21

 One thing that the commissioners did not report, either from hearing
 the county grievances or the numerous personal complaints of colonists, was

 widespread dissatisfaction with royal government per se, although that is

 how some later writers interpreted Bacon's rebellion against the king's gover-
 nor. The first complaint that the commissioners heard about on their
 arrival and the only complaint in the county grievances that they seriously
 regarded afterward was that the governor had summoned the General
 Assembly too often and that county taxpayers were consequently overbur-

 dened paying what they characterized as exorbitant rates of compensation
 that the assembly members voted themselves for their attendance at the

 annual meetings. The commissioners merely recommended that the General

 Assembly pass a law specifying that it meet every other year and no oftener

 and that burgesses' expense allowances be reduced.22

 The commissioners did not comment on Berkeley's not calling for
 new elections of members of the General Assembly at any time since 1660,

 shortly after he was restored to the governorship and Charles II was restored
 to the throne. Whenever a member of the House of Burgesses died or
 resigned or got promoted to the Council or moved out of his county, the
 governor called a special election to fill that seat, so from time to time

 the men of every county selected a new burgess, even though there was no
 general election at all for sixteen years. It is unclear whether landowning
 Virginians or the men who were disfranchised in 1670 believed that frequent

 elections were important or essential features of their representative govern-
 ment. By the year of the rebellion, though, Berkeley acknowledged that
 some people felt aggrieved by the long continuance of the assembly - known

 in the literature of Virginias history as the Long Assembly, as if it were equiv-
 alent to the Long Parliament of Charles I - and in May when he ordered a

 general election he stated as much in his writ that the secretary of the colony

 sent to each of the county sheriffs who conducted the election.23

 Had the commissioners looked beneath the surface of the county griev-

 ances and the personal complaints and paid closer attention to the recent

 history of the colony, they might have come closer to discovering the causes
 of the rebellion or developed a more sensitive appreciation of the reasons

 other than fear of the Native Americans that drew people into it. But it is

 entirely possible that the three royal commissioners were as deaf to the

 nuances of the language of the common men of Virginia as the old governor
 was to the actual voices of nearly everybody.

 The commissioners' report took no notice that the county grievances

 exhibited interesting similarities and differences that revealed some impor-

 tant information about the complaints and the men who complained. Some
 of the county grievances were signed, and some were not. There are no

 extant records describing the gatherings at which the texts were agreed to or

 subscribed or any indication for most of the counties how many men partic-

 ipated. (None contains the signature or mark of a woman.) The documents

 with a small number of signatures may have been authenticated in that man-

 ner, but those with dozens or scores of autographs and marks may possibly

 represent a broader support for the assertions than the documents that only

 a few men signed. Surry County residents submitted two differing sets of

 complaints, and two groups of men in Isle of Wight County submitted com-

 peting documents. From Nansemond County the commissioners received at

 least three, perhaps four, sets of grievances. The commissioners' report cryp-

 tically characterized the substance ofthat county's grievances differently than

 in the transcription that Samuel Wiseman authenticated of an unlocated

 manuscript and also differently than in the two extant originals, one bearing

 forty-one signatures and seventy-two marks and the other from "his Majtie.
 Poor butt Loyall Subjects of Nansemond," which has thirty-four signatures
 and twelve marks.24

 The commissioners received or preserved no record of grievances from

 Middlesex County, residence of Robert Beverley, one of Berkeley's most

 active allies in suppressing the rebellion and father of the historian; and they

 received nothing from Charles City County until the middle of May, after
 they had completed the bulk of their report. The submission from

 Accomack County, on the Eastern Shore, bore ten signatures and made an
 unusual request. Its authors declared that "Whereas wee are Sensible of the

 vast Charge this Unhappy Warr and Rebellion hath put the Country to: and

 it must be Expected to be defrayed out of the Country wee desire wee may

 bee Excluded from all and Every parte of the same (Wee being no way the
 Cause of it)."25

 Nearly all of the county grievances complained that the governor called

 the assembly into session too often and that the burgesses voted themselves

 large per diem allowances and tavern bills that the county's taxpayers had to

 pay. Most of the county documents also charged that other taxes were too

 high. The assembly had long placed an export tax on tobacco, at the rate of
 two shillings per hogshead (a cask that held about a thousand pounds of
 compressed leaf tobacco), to defray the ordinary expenses of the colony's

 government. The colony also provided a large plantation for the governor

 and a smaller one for the secretary of the colony, the assembly had long since

 exempted members of the governor's Council of State from paying taxes, and

 county courts and parish vestries also routinely exempted from taxation eld-

 erly and infirm people who were not economically productive. Men from
 nearly all of the counties complained about the high taxes assessed for
 constructing the obviously useless and ruinous fort at Point Comfort and
 another that was never even completed at Jamestown; and some of them

 mentioned other taxes levied for purposes that they claimed not to know -

 probably for erecting public buildings in the capital and for attempting to
 buy out the proprietors of the Northern Neck. No set of grievances com-

 plained about the land tax, called a quitrent, that all property owners paid to
 the king or about any of the customs charges and duties that acts of
 Parliament required be collected at the colony's port of entry. A few men
 complained that the defenseless state of the colony could be attributed in
 part to the failure of royal customs officers to collect what were called castle

 duties, gunpowder and shot that captains of ships were to supply when clear-

 ing through port.

 The similarities among the documents rather than the differences
 impressed the royal commissioners and may have diverted their attention

 from asking an important question: whether the differences suggested that

 at least some of the causes of the rebellion were of local origin. High taxes

 that the General Assembly levied with little or nothing to show for it were a

 common complaint, but the commissioners ignored the almost universal
 complaints in the county grievances about local taxes. The men of most
 counties also complained about high county and parish taxes and the man-
 ner in which the county courts levied them. All of the taxes were levied at a

 rate of so many pounds of tobacco per poll, or person: that is, every head of
 a household and every laboring man (called a "tithable" because each was
 required to pay the parish rates as well as the county taxes) was assessed the

 same amount, and every paid or indentured or enslaved laborer, whether
 white or black, male or female, was also assessed the same amount, the

 employer or owner being responsible for payment. Those taxes paid for the

 construction and maintenance of courthouses and jails, and parish taxes paid

 the expenses of churches, ministers' salaries, and for taking care of the poor

 and the orphaned. Several sets of grievances requested in strong language
 that when justices of the peace met to set the annual tax rate they not be
 allowed to go into secret session. Some even requested that a few popularly

 selected taxpayers be permitted to take part in the public assessment of the

 local taxes. Throughout the complaints about local taxation ran two themes:
 one was about how high the taxes were without benefiting the people
 at large; the other was that the manner of taxation appeared to benefit the

 people with property - the tobacco planters - at the expense of people who

 owned little or no land or raised little or no tobacco but were required to pay

 high taxes in tobacco, anyway.

 Most of the complaints, particularly those with large numbers of

 signatures and marks, singled out the county poll tax as the most serious
 complaint and recommended that all taxes be assessed on the land that
 people owned as a more nearly fair method of raising taxes. "We humbly

 propose," the James City County complaints (and several others) suggested,
 "the raisinge of our taxes & Cuntry dues, to be by a Land tax, & according
 to the estate & abillity of the Inhabitants of this Collony." The Isle of Wight
 County document, perhaps the least literate of them all, also complained
 about how poor people were at the mercy of wealthy and well-connected
 people. Their scribe wrote, "Whereas ther are some great persons both in
 honor, rich in estât and have severall ways of gaines and profitts are exempt-

 ed from paying Leavies and the poorest inhabitant being compelld to pay the

 great taxes which wee are burdened with having a hogshead or two of
 tobacco to pay for rent and near two hundred yearly for Leavies having a
 wife and two or three children to maintain whether our taxes are not the

 greater by such favour and privileges granted them which wee desire to be

 safe of by their paying of Leavies as well as wee they having noe necessitie

 from being soe exempted." The poorest, unsurprisingly, resented being taxed
 or overtaxed when the wealthiest were untaxed or undertaxed.26

 The men from Henrico County, where Nathaniel Bacon resided, also

 objected that local magistrates acted against the interests of the people and
 in their own interest. They complained, "It is a very greate Greevance
 that wee have these many years laine under heavy & unsupportable taxes
 officially Sixty pounds of tobacco for each tithable for 2 years follow-
 ing. . . . Wee are much Greeved that the major pt of the Commissioners of

 our County Court are men of a Consanguinity, and wee farther Report that

 noe County or Parish leave bee levyed without at least six of the Comonalty
 such as the County or Parish shall make Choyse of to sit with the
 Comissioners when the same is levied." That at least some of the justices of
 the peace - who were sometimes called commissioners of the peace - were
 "men of a Consanguinity" - that is, closely related to each other - made

 their actions appear even more devious and self-serving.27

 Some Surry County residents likewise requested "that for the future the
 Collectors of the Leavy (who Instead of Satisfaction were wont to give
 Churlish Answers) may be obliged to render Account In writing what the
 leavy is for to any that Shall desire it." Other residents of the same county

 declared "That itt has been the custome of the County Courts att the Laying

 of the Levy to withdraw into A privat Roome by means the poore people not
 knowing for what they paid the levy did allwayes admitt how theire taxes,
 should be so high." From Northampton County came a pair of recommen-
 dations on that subject: "That no person may be sett tax free" unless by a
 vote of a full bench of justices of the peace; and "That our County Records

 may be free open for Every man to Search and Require Copies as there oca-

 sions from time to time shall and may Require . . . paying the Clerk his Just
 fees."28

 What was wrong, the men who agreed to most of the county grievances
 complained, was not just that taxes were too high and that the assembly met

 too often, which is what the commissioners heard and reported, but that the

 class of landed men who made the laws and ran the parish and county gov-

 ernments were unfairly taxing the poor and the landless, who since passage

 of the 1670 act limiting who could vote were without a voice in selecting the

 men who levied the colony's taxes. Because the governor appointed members

 of the county courts, usually following recommendations from the justices

 of the peace, themselves, no taxpayers had a voice in who made local govern-

 ment decisions and set local tax rates, either, and none had effective leverage

 to force changes in local officials' behavior or policies. The county grievances

 reveal strong and widespread discontent with the county governments, not
 with the governor or his administration or with the king and his royal

 authority within the new empire. That essential fact is missing from the stan-

 dard interpretive narratives of the rebellion.

 Those were not new complaints, nor were the differences in perspective
 between landed and landless colonists new or surprising. The surviving
 records of every county for almost every decade in the colony's history con-

 tain evidence of resentment at what some people regarded as high-handed
 actions by officeholders and wealthy men who appeared to act as if they

 believed they were entitled to govern - and to govern however they pleased.

 The language in which that resentment was expressed and the manner in

 which the county courts attempted to regulate it or to suppress it exhibit the

 values and perspectives of both groups. There were degrees of dignity among

 free men, just as there were differences in degree between men and women

 and differences in degree between free men and their servants and enslaved

 laborers. Suggesting that a man had risen above his natural level or degrad-
 ing a man below it were both serious offences because they undermined the

 social hierarchy that the structure and processes of government reflected and
 protected. The distinctions between the landed and office-holding class
 and the laboring and landless class were conspicuous and openly acknowl-
 edged.

 Bernard Bailyn and Edmund S. Morgan in the twentieth century inter-

 preted the many complaints and the often-turbulent insubordination as

 evidence that the planters and justices of the peace and governor could
 not control a rootless mob of malcontents. The royal commissioners in the
 seventeenth century neglected the complaints and insubordination and
 therefore did not attempt to interpret them at all. That was a serious over-

 sight. The complaints that appeared in the county grievances in 1677, which
 white men of all but the very highest and very lowest classes endorsed or
 wrote, employed a peculiar late-medieval English vocabulary that suggests
 evidence of class-consciousness. They called themselves the commons of

 Virginia or the commonalty to distinguish themselves from their wealthier or

 more powerful or more privileged neighbors. Earlier Englishmen and some
 men as late as Cromwell's time had used the word commonalty to identify

 people who were not of the landed gentry or the nobility. The word had vir-
 tually disappeared from use in England by the 1670s, but it was in use in

 Virginia then because it was exactly the right word for the lower orders of
 white residents to use to identify themselves and their own interests. Those

 distinctive words and phrases appeared in five of the sets of county griev-

 ances - including in the Henrico County recommendation that "at least six
 of the Comonalty" be permitted to join the justices of the peace in setting
 the county levy - and elsewhere, and variants on them or their essence
 appeared in many other documents, including Bacons declarations that he

 signed as "General, by the consent of the people."29

 Actions and words of lower-class white men that were consistent with

 the language of the county grievances of 1677 predated Bacons Rebellion.

 In Surry County early in January 1674, the county's magistrates arrested and

 interrogated fourteen men who had met twice in December, first in the
 church of Lawne's Creek Parish and later in a place called the Devil's Field,

 charging that they conspired to refuse to pay their local taxes because the
 taxes were unjustly laid. The men who attended the meetings readily admit-
 ted that they had met and discussed and condemned the method that the

 county court had used to assess the taxes that they were supposed to pay.30

 That the justices of the peace had them all arrested and interrogated

 indicates that the magistrates, who for the most part belonged to the wealth-

 ier, landowning part of the community, believed that it was seditious for
 lesser men to question or even to discuss their official actions. The two prin-

 cipal justices of the peace who conducted the interrogations wrote a preface

 for the collected documents in the case when they were copied into the
 county's public records. Justices of the Peace Lawrence Baker and Robert

 Spencer wrote "Of how Dangerous consequence unlawfull Assemblyes and

 meetings have bin, is Evident by the Chronicles of our Native Country wch
 are occasioned by the Giddy headed Multitude, & unless repressed may
 prove the ruin of a Country." The two justices described the fourteen men

 as "a Company of Seditious & rude people" who by "theire Contemptuous

 behaviour & Carriage, not respecting Authority" deserved to be arrested and

 prosecuted under the Riot Act.31

 The justices of the peace fined the men and bound them over to appear
 before the next session of the General Court in Jamestown, at which time,

 in April 1674, it fined Mathew Swann, "the ringleader of them," two thou-

 sand pounds of tobacco and required all of the men to pay court costs. The
 following September the governor remitted Swann's fine "and alsoe the fines

 of the other poore men," provided that they "acknowledge there fault in the
 said County Court, and pay the Court Charges." The governor did not so

 much pardon their actions as mitigate their punishment for the sake of pre-
 venting further disorder, and he appointed Justice of the Peace Robert

 Spencer to the office of county sheriff the following November. That was

 how Berkeley had governed, keeping order by incorporating as many of the

 colony's white men as possible into his political orbit and system through

 obligation or conspicuous shared interest. Not so, the Surry County justices

 of the peace. That even discussion of the propriety of their actions appeared
 to them to warrant prosecution reveals a good deal about their values and

 how they believed that they were to be respected. The county's records also

 do not disclose that any of the men acknowledged fault or paid court costs,

 which reveals what the other poor men thought about their local govern-
 ment officers.32

 That episode has been exaggeratedly referred to sometimes as the

 Lawne's Creek uprising. It is moderately well documented, but it was not
 the only event of its kind. Later in 1674 some taxpayers in New Kent
 County also threatened to resist collection of the local taxes, and in 1675,

 Berkeley "appeas'd two mutinies . . . raysed by some secret villaines that

 wisphered amongst the people." There is no other surviving documentary
 evidence concerning those three events than Berkeley's passing references to

 them, but the governor and county officials worried that small farmers and

 tradesmen might mutiny, just as they worried about unrest among inden-
 tured servants and enslaved laborers and about real criminals.33

 When it appeared in the mid- 1670s that the Indians had suddenly
 become a danger to all of the English-speaking inhabitants of Virginia, dis-
 franchised men and overtaxed small farmers complained that the most
 wealthy and most politically powerful of their neighbors were overbearing,

 exploitive, and abusive and that by their actions they also endangered the

 safety of everybody.

 One of the three extant sets of 1677 grievances from Nansemond
 County, the one that exists only in transcription, includes a vivid narrative

 that dramatically brought all of the complaints about taxes and favoritism
 into focus. "Yor. Honrs. are sensible," the men of Nansemond informed the

 commissioners, "there was a rising in This part of the Country in May last,"
 yet another of what at the time were called mutinies, "occasione! by the

 grevious taxations & burthens wee lay under for many years before & to
 increase our pressures the militia would have Houses built intitul'd Forts

 under the pretence of destroying the Heathen." The authors of the griev-
 ances charged that the militia commanders had directed that the forts "be
 erected upon their owne lands which wee well perceived would have been

 the utter ruine of us the poore Comonalty & only self interest to themselves
 wee see & knowing the Heathen must be destroyed by a moving force,
 and the charge of these forts would have gone beyond our ability either to
 maintaine or build." The militia commanders ordered the complaining
 militiamen "to assemble together," but at that muster the men "roared
 them down by a generali roar of Commonalty." Common militiamen shout-
 ing down commissioned officers! That must have been astonishing and
 frightening, a humiliating and potentially very dangerous exhibition of
 insubordination. The soldiers must have been very angry, indeed, to be so

 bold. That episode, which is described in only the one unpublished docu-
 ment, was much more serious than the so-called Lawne's Creek uprising.

 "Yet," the men of Nansemond County continued, "our Militia order'd all

 manner of necessaryes as Axes, hoos, Halborrds, provisions & the like fitt for
 the worke & seeing ourselves in this sad condition the Heathen hourely
 expected to come upon us the excessive tax likewise that wee did readily

 account needlesse, and unnecessary," they asked permission to take their case

 to the governor. The commanding officers prudently "caused us to assemble
 ourselves together and every man to make his complaint personally." The

 militia commanders, either frightened or perhaps cautious, may have emu-

 lated Berkeley in giving their disaffected men an opportunity to state their

 complaints, as if understanding the principle of the safety valve long before
 the invention of the steam engine. "And that it might be thought noe
 tumult," the men's narration continued, "(as God knowes wee were with

 noe tumultuous Intensions) wee chose five men to goe to his Honr.," but

 Berkeley, who made several trips into the interior of the colony in the spring
 of 1676 to ascertain what Nathaniel Bacon and his men were doing, was
 "not at home" when the men from Nansemond County reached Jamestown.
 They related how "his Lady writ to his Honr: on our behalfes, and sent a
 Coppie of the letter downe to us, which was such a Satisfaction to us, that

 wee every man return'd to his owne home, for his Honr had appointed an

 Assembly to be on the fifth of May" - it was summoned for the fifth of June

 1676 - "& issued out Warrants for the chusing Burgesses & every free borne

 mans voat was hear 'd in Election. Against which Assembly wee drew up our

 Grievances & sent by our Burgesses who gave us great Satisfaction at their

 returne most of our grievances being satisfied."34

 The list of grievances that they "drew up" in 1676 is extant. That docu-

 ment is one of several unusual things about the June 1676 meeting of the
 General Assembly that deserve mention because they have been overlooked

 or misinterpreted. The contents of the county grievances of 1677 illustrate

 and explain those events and the sources of the complaints, but none of the

 historical narratives of Bacon's Rebellion thoroughly exploited the evidence
 of pre-1676 discontent to explain with accuracy the importance of what the

 June 1676 General Assembly did. That discontent was as important a reason

 for the governor to call for the election of a new assembly as the necessity to
 prepare for war with the Indians. The two causes converged, as the
 Nansemond County narrative and other events indicate, by an accident of
 timing. When Berkeley, who was out west in Henrico County, issued his

 writ for the election of a new assembly "for the better security of the Country

 from our Barbarous Enemies the Indians and better settling and quieting our
 domestick disorders and discontents," he also requested that "at the Election

 of the said Burgesses all and every person or persons there present have lib-

 erty to present freely to their said Burgesses all just Complaints as they or any
 of them have against mee as Governor." He also promised that he would
 "gladly joine with them in a Petition to his Sacred Majestie to appoint a new

 Governor of Virginia and thereby to ease and discharge mee from the great

 care and trouble thereof in my old age." Berkeley specifically requested that

 the men elected to the House of Burgesses "discharge that duty of their owne

 personall charge for the ease of the Country" and not require the county
 taxpayers to pay their expenses. As the men from Nansemond County and

 elsewhere understood the writ for election, they not only had the right to

 submit all of their grievances to the assembly, but they also believed that the

 governor had allowed all free men to vote, ignoring the law of 1670, and

 many of them, in fact, voted.35

 The undated document (internal evidence clearly indicates that it was

 drafted in the spring of 1676) to which the 1677 Nansemond County griev-
 ances refers and which in parts closely resembles their 1677 grievances,
 began, "Considerations upon the present troubles in Virginia," and opened,
 "The great oppression the people complaine of is the great taxes Levied on

 them Every yeer and the Unequall way of taxing them by the poles for that
 a poor man that hath nothing to maintain himself wife & child: pays as
 much for his levie as he that hath 2000 acres of Land." The men of

 Nansemond County, either as petitioners addressing the General Assembly

 or as electors instructing their burgesses, requested that county sheriffs (who

 kept part of the tobacco they collected to compensate them for their work)

 not be permitted to serve more than one year at the time (as in England, and
 they cited English law on that point). They complained that the annual
 meetings of the assembly cost every free person in the county more tobacco
 than most could afford, not only to pay the expenses of the burgesses but

 also the 400 pounds of tobacco that the secretary of the colony charged each
 county for sending out the writ of election. Because of these "burdens
 the people began to Mutinie in the year 1674." This was shortly after the
 Lawne s Creek disturbances and at about the same time that the taxpayers in

 New Kent County threatened to withhold their tobacco. The authors of the
 Considerations of 1676 therefore recommended that burgesses and other

 officials not be paid large salaries, that local officers do their jobs without pay

 to keep down taxes, and that such taxes as remained necessary "be levied by
 a land tax, which seems to be the most Equall Imposition, and will
 generally take of the complaints of the people, although perhapps some of
 the worst sorte wil not like it who hould greater proportions of land then

 they can make use of."36

 The Considerations of 1676 and many of the grievances of 1677, in
 spite of the submissive form and tone in which they were phrased, bristle

 with resentment against local magistrates, sheriffs, militia officers, burgesses,
 and tax-exempt elites. The commissioners' formal report contains not one
 syllable about any of those dramatic events or serious complaints or any

 hints that the commissioners recognized their significance. Historical narra-

 tives that have provided the principal interpretations of the rebellion have

 missed almost all of those events and their significance. The county justices

 of the peace and the militia officers, not the governor or the king, were the

 primary objects of the most serious complaints.

 The reformers elected to the June 1676 assembly passed laws to solve
 several of the most important domestic problems. The assembly required

 annual rotation in the office of sheriff; it forbade the holding of more than

 one local office at a time; it regulated fees and practices in the secretary's and

 the county clerks' offices; it authorized representatives of the people to be

 selected to meet with justices of the peace when the county taxes were laid;
 it required that vestrymen in each parish be elected every third year; it
 rescinded the tax exemption for members of the governor's Council;
 it quashed all legal proceedings instituted against participants in the "many

 unlawfull tumults routs and riotts in divers parts of this country"; it repealed

 the 1670 law that limited the vote to freeholders and housekeepers; and it
 permanently disqualified two wealthy men from Charles City County,
 Edward Hill and John Stith, from all public offices as a consequence of their

 bullying behavior and "stirring up the late differences and misunderstand-

 ings that have happened between the honourable governor and his majesties
 good and loyal subjects."37

 Many of the people's grievances that could have fueled the spirit of rebel-
 lion were fully redressed at the June 1676 assembly that dealt with much

 more than the threat from the Indians. The laws of that assembly suggest
 that the political system over which Sir William Berkeley presided could

 respond effectively or even justly to pressure for redress of grievances; but

 that does not answer the questions why those grievances grew to such a

 height that riots or mutinies took place in more than one-fourth of the coun-

 ties before they could be redressed or why, if they had been redressed in June,

 Nathaniel Bacon was able to enlist a great many Virginians in his revolt

 against Berkeley's government in August.

 What happened between 28 June when the assembly adjourned and 31 July

 when Bacon began issuing proclamations against Berkeley? The events of

 July 1676, while Bacon and the county militia officers were recruiting the

 new army, are poorly recounted in the contemporary narratives of events or
 in later recollections.38

 It is quite likely that the reforms of the June assembly were imperfectly

 known in much of the colony before the end of July. There being no print-

 ing press in Virginia, laws were published by being read out loud to the

 people - first on the statehouse steps on the day that the assembly adjourned

 and later at each courthouse when the monthly meeting of the county court

 took place.39 If full handwritten sets of the laws of June 1676 were available

 for every county as early as their respective July court days - which is possi-

 ble but by no means certain - only those people who were present and sober
 and paying attention throughout the long readings would have learned
 precisely what the laws contained. Other people may have learned little or
 nothing or heard about them only vaguely or piecemeal and therefore
 retained their grievances unabated. That would account in part for the
 appeal that Bacons declarations carried.

 At the end of July, Bacon issued The Declaration of the People against

 Sir William Berkeley, the first of his proclamations challenging the right of

 the governor to govern. The first in its long list of complaints was that the

 governor "having upon specious pretences of publick works, raised unjust
 taxes upon the Commonalty for advancing of private favourites and other
 sinister ends," and the second was that he had "abused & rendered

 compemptible his Mties: Justices by advancing to places of Judicature

 epitomized some of the numerous individual complaints contained in the

 county grievances of 1677 and blamed them all on Berkeley in 1676. Bacon

 attempted to supercede Berkeley as governor of the colony by appealing to
 men and women, in addition to the thousand-man army that he legally
 commanded, by repeating their complaints about county officials' miscon-

 duct and stating that they were the results of Berkeley's maladministration

 that introduced corruption and favoritism everywhere and consequently left

 the colony defenseless in the face of its enemies.40

 That is exactly what parts of the belated Charles City County grievances

 that the commissioners received in May 1 677 appeared to state. The griev-
 ances recited a number of Bacon's charges against Berkeley and indicated

 that those charges appealed to "a handfull of poore ignorant and unlearned

 people, whose unskillfullnes in the law, may Easilye lay us open to divers fail-

 ings." The men of Charles City County asserted that they were "seduced into

 beliefe" that Berkeley aspired to tyrannical government and that he appoint-
 ed unqualified sycophants to office and raised taxes to support them and

 perverted the course and courts of justice. The Charles City County protest

 also included a long list of specific complaints about abusive and allegedly
 illegal behavior of Edward Hill, whom one of the June 1676 laws had barred

 from public office for those very acts. Berkeley had nevertheless appointed

 Hill to the command of the county during the rebellion, and it is entirely
 possible that Hill obstructed or delayed the compilation of the county's

 grievances in the spring of 1677. After it was clear that Berkeley was leaving
 Virginia, removing all official protection from Hill, angry residents of
 Charles City County compiled and submitted their list of grievances, which

 is much the longest of any of the county documents. It was easy for the com-

 missioners and for readers of the belated Charles City County grievances,

 which scarcely resemble any of the others and are also among the few to have

 been published, to be seduced also into believing that Berkeley's misrule was
 the cause of the rebellion and that he and men like Hill had obstructed

 reform.41

 It was also easy for royal officials in England and for later historians to
 read about the assembly's actions in June 1 676 and believe much the same

 thing. Bacon's having extorted a general's commission from the assembly, the

 king and his ministers evidently believed that the entire budget of laws was

 of Bacons doing. In the autumn of 1676, when the king issued instructions

 to the three royal commissioners, he required that all of the laws of the June

 1676 assembly be annulled, which the assembly did when it next met, which

 it did while the royal commissioners and the governor were getting at each

 others' throats in February 1677. In fact, although Bacon was elected to the
 June 1676 assembly from Henrico County, he did not attend it except to
 threaten it, and if he had a reforming agenda in June 1676, he never
 presented it. A good many supporters of Bacons policy of waging aggressive
 war against the Indians were legal members of the assembly, and it was
 they who proposed and adopted the laws of June 1676 but in a legitimate

 parliamentary manner and with the consent of the governor and in the best

 tradition of representative government. In fact, the burgesses who passed the

 reform laws and also elected Bacon a general refused to endorse Berkeley's
 request that they join him in petitioning the king to replace him with a

 younger and more vigorous governor.42

 An unidentified person at an unidentified time later added the words

 "Bacon's Laws" to the sole, surviving manuscript text of the laws of the
 June 1676 session. When the laws were published early in the nineteenth

 century in William Waller Hening's Statutes at Large, the editor, no doubt

 having read John Daly Burk's history, also erroneously believed that Bacon
 had imposed the principal laws on the assembly and incorrectly identified
 the laws ofthat session as "Bacon's Laws," perpetuating a misinterpretation

 that may have also misled some historians.43

 The county grievances of 1677 and other evidence clearly show other-
 wise. The grievances disclose that the conditions that the laws of June 1676
 remedied were under lively discussion before Bacon's Rebellion began and
 were not Bacon's work. The ill-informed king and his ministers did not
 understand that and ordered them repealed. Residents of Virginia knew the
 facts, however, even if the king and his commissioners did not. The
 Gloucester County grievances of 1677 specifically requested "That whereas
 Their were severall Grievances presented to the Assembly in June last, in

 order to prevent many exorbitant fees, & other Disorders in Governmt;
 upon which, many good lawes were consented to, & agreed upon by that
 grand Assembly; before the Rebell Bacon came to interrupt the said
 Assembly: We beg that those good & wholesom Lawes, may be confirmed."

 But a similar request included in one of the sets of grievances from
 Nansemond County that a great many poor men made their marks on, to
 reinstate the work of their "Burgesses who gave us great Satisfaction,"

 brought from the commissioners a tart response: "Impudent and mutinous
 to aske seeinge his Maj estie has by his instructions and proclamation
 declared all that assemblys Laws null and void, because of Bacons force att

 the time upon the Assembly then sittinge."44

 The documentary record of Bacons Rebellion, and particularly the county

 grievances of 1677, disclose that it was the actions of county officials, against

 whom county residents had no legal mode of redress, that created much of
 the anger and resentment that gave Bacon's declarations their appeal in

 1676. Those local officials, integral and essential functionaries in the govern-

 ment of colonial Virginia, were not responsible to the people they governed
 and seldom had to answer to provincial officials who appointed them.
 Distrust and resentment were almost certain to result. As in England,
 Virginias society and economy were conspicuously hierarchical, and people

 at or near the bottom often believed that they had reason to resent people at

 or near the top; and people at or near the top often believed that they had

 reason to distrust or fear people from below. The one group under such

 stressful circumstances was prone to riot or rebel, and the other group feared

 riots and rebellions. The attitudes of the men near the bottom are readily

 apparent in the language of the county grievances.

 The attitudes of the men nearer the top are equally evident in their

 words. In 1676 and 1677 they used contemptuous language about the poor
 and laboring men that wealthy planters and government officials employed

 routinely during the seventeenth century. For instance, William Sherwood,

 who already was or soon would be attorney general of Virginia, wrote at the

 beginning of June 1676 that Bacon's first volunteers were "indigent & disaf-

 fected persons" and "rabble." Following the appearance of Bacon at the head

 of several hundred armed men later that month to wrest a general's commis-
 sion from the General Assembly, Sherwood repeated the word "rabble" and

 wrote that Bacon's men were "the scum of the Country" Another influential

 merchant-planter, Nicholas Spencer, when describing Bacons followers at

 the beginning of August 1676, wrote, "hee is sufficiently strengthened with
 the Rabble, of which sort this country chiefely consists, wee serving as A

 sinke to drayne Engld of her filth."45

 Edward Hill's self-justification, which has been published and often-
 quoted, breathes the same contempt for his underlings. About the time that
 his friend Berkeley left Virginia, Hill composed a long and indignant
 response to the Charles City County grievances, filling both sides of four-

 teen large sheets of paper. Hill was utterly contemptuous of the men of his
 county who accused him of misbehavior, and he did not spare his
 words even when criticizing women. "Sarah Weeks," he wrote, was "an Idle

 infamous slutt to the highest degrees, of robing, thieving, & whoreing, &c."
 To be accused by those people was the worst possible insult. "I cannot but

 with trouble & sorrow consider," Hill began his response to the county com-

 plaints, "that to be called to a barr, & to be charged wth Severall Crimes
 & misdemeanors, & clamour 'd against by a route of people, how base, mal-
 licious, envious, & Ignorant soever, it is still a lessening of reputation &

 darkening of good fame let ones Loyalty, inocency, Justice, &C integrity be

 never so great." Hill also wrote that Governor Berkeley "by the Judgmt of

 the moste wise of this Country . . . hath been thought to have governed this

 thirty odd years wth the moste Candour, Justice, wisdome, & integrity, that

 was possible for man to governe, and more especially considering whome he

 had to governe."46

 Berkeley's close friend Philip Ludwell also described the members of

 Bacons army as "the scume of the country." He characterized them as "men,
 whose fortunes & Inclinations being equally Desperate, were ffitt for the
 purpose there being not 20 in the whole Route, but what were Idle & will
 not worke, or such whose Debaucherie or 111 Husbandry has brought in

 Debt beyond hopes or thought of payment these are the men that were sett

 noe taxes paied, though for the most part of them, they pay none themselves,

 would have all magistracie & Governmnt taken away & sett up one them-
 selves, & to make their Good Intentions more manifest stick not to talk

 openly of shareing mens Estates among them selves." Ludwell also took
 pains to point out that not only did Bacon acknowledge no "Law of God or

 man," but he also frequently uttered many "new Coyned oaths of wch. (as If

 he thought God was delighted wth. his Ingénuité in that kind) he was very
 liberali.""?

 Other contemporaries also commented on Bacon's swearing. The gover-
 nor was a devoted churchman and was especially disgusted at Bacon's
 profanity. "His usual oath," Berkeley wrote, "which he swore at least a
 Thousand times a day was God damme my Blood," language that other con-

 temporary witnesses also reported (and that Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker

 deliberately excluded from his commentaries on Bacon's character, purposes,

 and actions). Berkeley continued, "and god so infected his blood that it bred
 lice in incredible numbers so that for twenty dayes he never washt his
 shirts but burned them. To this God added the Bloody flux and an honest

 minister wrote this Epitaph on him[:] Bacon is Dead I am sorry at my hart

 / that Lice and flux should take the hangmans part." Berkeley, too, on occa-
 sion referred to Bacon's followers as rabble, but for a man charged with

 abusing his powers as governor, he was surprisingly and generally sympathet-

 ic to the plight of the people he governed, "considering," as Edward Hill had

 written and he, too, might have believed, "whome he had to governe."48

 Berkeley departed Virginia for England late in April 1677 but died
 before he was able to explain himself in person to his king. That closed the

 political career of an extraordinary man who lived and governed too long for

 his reputation, which the rebellion and his conduct during its aftermath per-

 manently sullied. His widow remained in Virginia and made their Green

 Spring plantation the rallying point for the Virginia planters and politicians

 who strove to preserve the political and economic institutions and practices

 that were Berkeley's legacy. That legacy, which was firmly in place long
 before the rebellion challenged it, was a government of the tobacco planters,
 by the tobacco planters, and for the tobacco planters.

 Even though the February 1677 General Assembly reenacted many of

 the laws of the June 1676 session, it did not reenact the most significant
 reforms that the king had ignorantly ordered repealed: restoration of white
 adult manhood suffrage, authority for the commonalty to participate in
 levying local taxes, and triennial election of vestrymen. In spite of all the
 sharp public criticism of the poll tax, the landowning men in the General
 Assembly and on the county courts never replaced it with a tax on land.

 They did not increase taxes on themselves, even though during subsequent

 decades the men who owned increasingly large numbers of enslaved laborers

 did have to pay more taxes on that part of their property. The complaints
 that Virginia men recorded in the county grievances remained largely
 unmet. The county elites lost or yielded nothing to the commonalty.49

 The insulting language of Berkeley's adherents leaves a very different impres-

 sion of Bacon s followers than their own language as recorded in the county
 grievances, and the dismissive language of the commissioners' narrative

 offers yet another perspective. The self-consciously literary chroniclers John
 Cotton and his wife Ann Cotton, who wrote in the immediate aftermath

 of the rebellion, and Thomas Mathew, who wrote his memoir of the events

 in 1705, recorded their own distinctive portraits of the people and events of
 Bacon's Rebellion. Historians who have employed those different
 sources more or less indiscriminately have risked jumbling disparate inter-

 pretations and characterizations together without regard to the perspectives

 or purposes of the men or women who created them. And that the histori-

 ans have nearly all disregarded or substantially neglected the language of the
 class of men who rebelled certainly weakened their narratives and under-

 mined their interpretations.

 The substance and the language of the county grievances, with their

 complaints about the conduct of local officials that are echoed in many other
 documents of the time, offer additional reasons why the interpretation of

 Bacon's Rebellion in Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker's Torchbearer of the
 Revolution as a democratic, home-rule antecedent of the American

 Revolution cannot be maintained. The documents contain language that

 Wertenbaker might have cited to good advantage had he focused on the sub-

 stance of the complaints and who got blamed, but they were directed at local

 Virginia officials and not at royal officials or even at the old governor. Had
 Wilcomb Washburn made full use of the county grievances in The Governor

 and the Rebel, he would not have missed or under-appreciated the pre-1675

 events and might therefore have been able to explain better why fighting that

 began when outlying settlers took matters into their own hands in the face

 of perceived threats from the Indians then spread throughout the colony and
 became a rebellion in which hundreds or thousands of people participated

 for reasons that had little or nothing directly to do with the threat from the

 Indians. Had Edmund S. Morgan devoted more attention to the language of

 the county grievances in his American Slavery, American Freedom, he might

 have had to modify his characterization of the local elites as exercising insuf-

 ficient control over the unruly lower classes to suggest that some of the lower
 classes believed that they were over- rather than under-governed.
 Had Stephen Saunders Webb employed the county grievances more system-
 atically in 1676, his interpretation of the subsequent Stuart crackdown on

 colonial governments might have been enriched with examples of how colo-

 nial governors and colonial assemblies had brought into being and nourished

 self-sustaining and irresponsible local government institutions that allowed

 discontent to arise and ripen into rebellion. The grievances demonstrate, as

 Warren M. Billings suggests in his biography of Berkeley, how the old gov-
 ernor became the unfortunate residual legatee of the local consequences of

 county government structures and practices that were in place and function-

 ing when he first arrived in the colony thirty-four years earlier.

 Fine modern scholarship on seventeenth-century Virginias social
 history indicates that during the final years of the seventeenth century and

 into the first decades of the eighteenth century the tobacco planters ruled

 their households and their colony rather like the commonalty of Virginia in
 the 1670s charged that the justices of the peace had dominated the counties.
 In their households and in their tobacco fields, those men ruled as they
 believed they were entitled to rule, and they governed the colony as if

 they believed they were entitled to govern it. Other scholarship. on the devel-
 opment of the slave economy suggests that economic, commercial, and
 agricultural considerations, not primarily the ease of regulating laborers, as
 Morgan in part suggested, motivated the planters' subsequent rapid shift
 from indentured to enslaved labor. The laws that their representatives in the
 General Assembly enacted exempted them from most of the restraints on
 how they managed their enslaved black laborers, legal and contractual
 restraints that governed and had governed their management of their white

 indentured and paid laborers, a population that in the latter years of the cen-

 tury was a declining proportion of all of the colony's laborers.50

 In the planters' patriarchy that emerged into full flower in the decades
 following Bacons Rebellion, whether as a consequence of it or merely as a
 chronological coincidence, authority of all kinds was conspicuously concen-
 trated: in the hands of the heads of households; in the hands of plantation

 patriarchs; in the hands of the self-perpetuating groups of men who sat on
 the parish vestries and county courts; in the hands of the influential men
 who held public office as clerks, surveyors, and customs officers, men who

 collected large fees and often served for life; and in the hands of the mem-
 bers of the governor s Council who received their lifetime appointments
 from the Crown.

 The political and social institutions and practices of Virginia in the
 1670s were strong enough to survive Bacons Rebellion unchanged, even if
 they could not always control or repress aspiring or frustrated white
 men who resented overbearing elites or whose own failings or ill fortunes

 prevented them from joining the propertied and prosperous part of the pop-

 ulation. The political institutions and practices also survived, largely in tact,
 the Stuart crackdown on colonial governments during the fifteen years

 following Bacon's Rebellion, even if in the long run they could not prevail in

 the planters' attempt to escape Parliament's navigation acts and stricter con-
 trols over colonial commerce.

 Sir William Berkeley had preserved and strengthened the central institu-

 tion of representative government, the General Assembly that had been
 formed in 1619, and therefore his legacy contained within it the essence of

 republican government, but it was in no way a democratic legacy, and it
 did not extend to local government. Social and political stratification persist-
 ed, and the increased reliance of the great planters on enslaved laborers
 amplified that stratification. There may be a chicken-and-egg problem in
 attempting to sort out whether the political and economic cultures of
 Berkeley's Virginia made the creation of the slave economy possible or
 whether the slave economy shored it up and allowed it to flourish. Either

 way, that was the origin of the Old South.51
