 COMPARISON OF LATE WOODLAND CULTURES:

 DELAWARE, POTOMAC, AND SUSQUEHANNA RIVER VALLEYS,
 MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION

 Michael Stewart

 A variety of archaeological cultures, each familiar with maize and other cultigens,
 are identified for the Late Woodland period (A.D. 900-1600) in the three major drainage
 systems of the Middle Atlantic Region. Community patterns vary within and across drain-
 ages both synchronically anddiachronically, and include everythingfrom dispersed hamlets
 to large stockaded villages. The importance of agriculture, environment, and the social
 contexts of the cultures are examined.

 INTRODUCTION

 As the latest and one of the most archaeologically visible segments of regional prehistory, the Late

 Woodland period (A.D. 900/1000 to European contact) has been the focus of much attention. A variety
 of archaeological cultures, each familiar with maize and other cultigens, have been documented in the
 Middle Atlantic Region. This paper examines the Late Woodland prehistory of three of the major drainage
 basins in the region, that of the Delaware, Susquehanna, and Potomac rivers. The influence of environmen-

 tal diversity and the role of agriculture on cultural diversity and cultural evolution is addressed. The trends
 and patterning represented in the prehistory of the three drainage basins is typical of the broader region.
 This paper builds on an earlier synthesis of regional Late Woodland cultures compiled by Custer
 (1986a). The role that cultigens play in subsistence strategies varies dramatically, both within and between
 drainages, at single points in time and throughout the Late Woodland period as a whole. Community
 patterns vary correspondingly, and range from small dispersed hamlets to large stockaded villages.
 Environmental limitations and variability are only minor factors contributing to cultural diversity throughout
 most of the period, while the nature of regional interactions between native peoples seems to be a more
 significant influence in shaping prehistoric cultures.

 ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

 The Middle Atlantic Region is roughly bounded to the north by what becomes known as Iroquoia

 during historic times and southern New England, the Ohio Valley to the west, and the Southeast to the
 south. Each of the river basins under study crosscuts a series of distinctive physiographic provinces, and
 encompasses portions of the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
 and West Virginia (Figures 1 and 2). Northern portions of the Shenandoah River Valley are included in
 considerations of cultural developments in the Potomac Basin. The physiographic provinces encompassed
 by the drainage basins include the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, Blue Ridge/Reading Prong, Ridge and Valley,
 and Appalachian Plateau. The Potomac River empties into Chesapeake Bay, a body of water created as

 a result of Holocene sea level rise

 which drowned portions of the main
 stem of the Susquehanna River and
 adjacent landscapes.

 Of the three drainage basins, the

 Susquehanna Basin is the largest,
 followed by the Potomac and Dela-
 ware basins (Figure 3). Each of the
 three river basins contain extensive

 tracts of alluvial and stream terrace

 landscapes that would have been
 suitable for prehistoric farming or
 gardening. ' A review of published
 soil surveys indicates that there is
 little overall difference in the agri-
 cultural potential of floodplain soils
 between the three drainages.

 The productivity and quality of

 floral and faunal communities in the

 Piedmont, Ridge and Valley, and
 Plateau physiographic provinces are
 generally comparable for all of the
 drainages. Similar statements can
 also be made for the lithic resources

 found in the physiographic zones
 encompassed by each drainagebasin.
 Materials useful in prehistoric
 chipped stone technologies are spo-
 radically found in the Piedmont,
 more consistently concentrated in the Blue Ridge/Reading Prong and Ridge and Valley provinces, and
 again somewhat scattered in the Plateau province.

 The Delaware and Potomac drainage basins include extensive tidal (fresh, brackish, and saltwater)
 and non-tidal coastal environments. The Susquehanna Basin could be included in this category considering
 its relationship with Chesapeake Bay. These coastal zones are typical of the most biologically productive
 environments in the entire region. Runs of anadromous fish are able to penetrate well into the interior
 of the Delaware and Susquehanna drainages, beyond the Coastal Plain, owing to the low falls on each
 at the juncture with the Piedmont province. The falls on the Potomac are more substantial and provide
 a major barrier to migrating fish populations. Lithic resources in the Coastal Plain are generally limited
 to cobbles associated with stream deposits.

 Today, and throughout historic times, climate throughout the region supports the cultivation of

 domestic crops. However, in some western and northern sections of the region, the average number of
 frost free days (± 120) approaches the minimum required for a corn/maize crop to reach maturity (see
 for example Hay et al 1987:5; Wall 1981:10). It is possible for minor aberrations in climate to place a
 harvest in these areas in jeopardy.

 Relatively modern/historic climate and vegetation are generally in-place throughout the region
 sometime between 1000 B.C. and 800 B.C.. Changes in the environment after this time are viewed as
 alterations of historic/modern patterns, rather than as long term shifts which characterized the environmental

 episodes of earlier times (e.g., Carbone 1976:107). A time of increased dryness has been postulated
 between approximately A.D. 1000 and 1200 (e.g., Brush 1986; Carbone 1976), and cool moist to cool
 dry conditions for the time between A.D. 1300 and 1600 (Vento and Rollins 1989), which would include
 what has been referred to as the "little ice age" (Carbone 1982). More detailed summaries of paleoenviron-
 mental changes for the drainage basins are found in Carbone (1976) and the work of Custer (1984, 1989),
 Dent (1979), Stewart (1980, 1990a), Stewart and Cavallo (1983a, b); Vento and Rollins 1989; Vento et
 al (1990), and Wall (1981).

 During the Late Woodland period, the extent of floodplain landscapes in each of the drainage basins

 is thought to have resembled their present configurations. Region-wide studies of floodplain stratigraphy
 (Vento and Rollins 1989; Vento et al 1990) have documented a series of Late Woodland paleosols,
 generally corresponding with the current positions of levees along the main stem and major tributaries
 of the Delaware and Susquehanna basins. Similar conditions can be noted for the Potomac, although

 relevant information is scattered through a variety of published and unpublished reports. Stratigraphie
 studies have also suggested that floodplain stability was greatest from approximately A.D. 900/1000 until
 1200/1300 (Vento and Rollins 1989; Vento et al 1990). Flooding appears to be more frequent in the latter
 portions of the Late Woodland period.

 CHRONOLOGY OF MAINE AND OTHER CULTIGENS

 The earliest appearance of maize and other cultigens is at Meadowcroft Rocksheiter, located in the
 Upper Ohio Valley just beyond the margins of what has been defined as the Middle Atlantic Region
 (Adovasio and Johnson 1981). A variety of maize types appear in Middle Woodland deposits at the site,
 beginning at 2325 B.P.+75 years (375 B.C.). Cucurbits occur in even earlier excavation levels (Early

 Woodland), circa 900/800 B.C. (Adovasio and Johnson 1981:72). Adovasio and Johnson (1981:74, 78)
 reason that if these remains are occurring so early at Meadowcroft, interpreted as a "backcountry " location,
 their use by peoples in surrounding areas must have been considerable at an equally early time.

 Eight-rowed Northern Flint, the predominant variety seen throughout the Middle Atlantic Region

 (10 row variety also seen), is found in the nearby Ohio Valley by A.D. 800 (Watson 1988). Ohio Valley
 sections of western Pennsylvania contain sites producing the remains of maize between A.D. 800/900 and
 1200 (for example see Lantz 1989). Eight-rowed Northern Flint does not appear at Meadowcroft Rock-
 shelter until after A.D. 1200. In central New York, and of relevance to the Delaware and Susquehanna
 drainages, maize is found on Owasco sites circa A.D. 1000 and later (Ritchie #nd Funk 1973; Winter
 1971). Its tentative presence in coastal New York is assigned a much later date (Ceci 1990).

 As detailed below, maize is seen throughout much of the Middle Atlantic Region circa A.D. 900/1000.

 This appearance correlates with the establishment of sedentary settlements in major floodplains. Radiocar-
 bon dates cannot be used as the basis for confidently arguing that the use of maize is earlier in one portion
 of the region than another. Although direct physical evidence is not overwhelming, the use of cultigens
 appears to be even more intensive/extensive by A.D. 1200/1300.

 In the Delaware drainage basin, the earliest date for maize, A.D. 940, comes from mid-sections of

 the Valley, at the Trenton Barracks Site in Trenton, New Jersey (William Liebknecht, 1991 personal
 communication). In the Upper or northern sections of the Delaware Valley, Cucurbita sp. is the earliest
 dated cultigen at A.D. 1060+60 years (Fischler and French 1991:160). Settlement shifts circa A.D.
 800/900, involving the location of sedentary settlements in broad expanses of arable floodplain, also imply
 the existence and importance of cultigens in the broader region (for example see Stewart 1990b; Stewart
 and Cavallo 1983a; Stewart et al 1986). The occurrence of maize and beans, however, is most consistently
 associated with dates post-dating A.D. 1200 (Fischler and French 1991:161; Stewart 1990b; Stewart et
 al 1986; Williams et al 1982). Maize, or any other cultigens, are extremely rare in the Lower Delaware
 Valley and the Delmarva Peninsula in general (Figure 4; Custer 1989:327-328).

 Maize and Cucurbita sp. are associated with Clemson's Island and Owasco cultures of Middle and

 Upper sections of the Susquehanna Valley (Hay et al 1987; Lucy 1991; Stewart 1990c). The beginnings
 of Clemson's Island culture are dated circa A.D. 700/800 and the use of cultigens is assumed to be an
 integral part of this adaptation. Associations of physical remains with radiocarbon dated charcoal demon-
 strates the use of maize by A.D. 900/1000, along with beans and tobacco (East et al 1988). In the Lower
 Susquehanna Valley, the initial years of the Late Woodland period are poorly known. Maize, beans, and
 squash are in use by A.D. 1300 in association with Shenks Ferry occupations (Kinsey and Graybill 1971).
 The use of cultigens is assumed to be in-place throughout the Potomac River basin circa A.D.

 900/1000. In the upper and middle sections of the drainage, this assumption is based upon the physical
 presence of maize and beans in dated contexts (Curry and Kavanagh 1991; Gardner 1986). The earliest
 dates, A.D. 855±60 years and A.D. 730+150 years, are associated with maize at the Cresaptown and
 Paw Paw sites in the Upper Potomac Valley (Curry and Kavanagh 1991:6-7). In lower sections of the
 drainage and along the western shore of Chesapeake Bay, the use of cultigens at this time is inferred from
 a re-orientation of sedentary settlements to the floodplains of major streams, population increases, and
 an increase in the size of residential groups (Gardner 1976; Steponaitis 1986). Also arguing from the
 perspective of settlement shifts, Potter (1982) suggests that plant domestication is a subsistence focus of
 native peoples on the lower Potomac by A.D. 1300.

 of the Late Woodland period in the Susquehanna Valley are found in Custer (1986c), Graybill (1989),

 River Valley and adjacent zones. The bibliographies of these works contain extensive listings of other
 relevant literature.

 Delaware Valley

 In the Upper Delaware Valley, settlement in small hamlets, consisting of a few houses clustered in

 the floodplain of the river, are visible from the initial years of the Late Woodland period and designated
 as Pahaquara by Kraft (1986a and various). Hunting and gathering camps and stations are found in

 surrounding zones and are presumed to have been created in support of the hamlets. The hamlets may
 have been abandoned on a seasonal basis.

 This settlement pattern is evident in middle and some lower sections of the Delaware Valley by A.D.
 1200/1300. The Williamson Site located near Frenchtown, New Jersey is an example of a hamlet-like
 settlement from the mid-range of the valley (Stewart et al. 1986). Renewed excavations by Jack Cresson
 and his associates at the Gruno Farm Site, located near Evesboro, New Jersey, have revealed a large house
 pattern and debris resembling the hamlets of the Upper Delaware Valley (Stewart 1987:112). It is likely
 that this settlement and subsistence pattern dates as early as A.D. 900 in these downstream areas, but the
 evidence is not unassailable (Stewart 1990b). On the basis of ethnohistoric data, some researchers have

 speculated that agriculturally-based settlements may have been larger than hamlets in sections of the valley
 now occupied by Philadelphia and Camden (Thurman 1973; Wallace 1947). Becker (1985, 1986, 1988),
 however, presents convincing evidence to the contrary, arguing that involvement with maize cultivation
 is a post-contact phenomena with some groups along the Delaware.

 Areas surrounding Delaware Bay, and the Delmarva Peninsula in general, exhibit hamlet types of

 settlements. However, this settlement pattern appears to be based on traditional hunting and gathering
 pursuits and not agriculture (Custer 1984, 1989).

 The trends noted above characterize the remainder of the Late Woodland period, or until the early

 17th century, in the Delaware Valley. In the Upper Delaware Valley, the archaeological cultures post-dating
 A.D. 1350/1400 are referred to as Munsee, and are related to historically known native people of the area
 (Kraft 1986 and various). Neither planned, nucleated villages, nor any type of fortified settlements have
 yet to be identified within this section of the drainage basin.

 Stylistically, half of the valley's mid-section can be linked with coastal areas, especially those to the

 north in New Jersey and eastern New York (Stewart 1985). Lower sections of the Delaware Valley have
 affinities with both northern and southern coastal areas. The northern half of the Middle Delaware Valley
 is clearly linked with the upper reaches of the drainages and south-central New York. Evidence of trade,

 primarily in the form of ceramics, reveals linkages from one end of the valley to the other (Stewart 1989).
 In general, however, there is minimal archaeological evidence for trade and exchange during the Late
 Woodland period in the Delaware Valley and surrounding areas.

 Susquehanna Valley

 The cultural trajectory of the Late Woodland period is clearest in the upper and middle sections of

 the drainage basin. The sequence begins with the Clemson's Island culture (circa A.D. 700/800 to A.D.

 1200/1300), typical of the middle and large portions of the upper sections of the drainage, and early-middle
 Owasco (circa A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1200), common on northern reaches of the drainage in Pennsylvania
 and north into New York. Each archaeological culture is involved with the use of domesticates. Clemson's

 Island communities are organized in hamlets and unfortified villages (but see Garrahan 1990 for contrasting
 opinion). The relationship between hamlets and villages in a contemporaneous settlement pattern is
 unknown. Burial mounds are associated with select Clemson's Island settlements and it has been suggested
 that these sites are focal points linking a number of communities. Owasco villages are unfortified, but
 give the impression of being larger than their Clemson's Island counterparts (Ritchie and Funk 1973).

 Stylistically and culturally, the area can be linked with Appalachian Highland zones to the north
 (portions of the Susquehanna and Delaware drainages) and south (Potomac drainage basin). Figure 5 depicts
 this relationship. However, there is little archaeological evidence of trade to go along with what is
 perceived to be a moderate to high degree of cultural interaction through this area (Stewart 1989, 1990c).
 The Lower Susquehanna Valley appears to be lacking a resident population during early segments
 of the Late Woodland period, or prior to about A.D. 1300 (Graybill 1989; but see Custer 1986c, 1987).
 At this time, the lower valley is more closely tied to cultural developments in the northern Chesapeake

 Bay, Piedmont, and northern Delmarva Peninsula than with the middle and upper reaches of the Susque-
 hanna River Basin.

 Sometime between A.D. 1200 and 1300, settlements in the middle and upper portions of the Susque-

 hanna Valley become increasingly more nucleated and ultimately fortified. Mound construction and related
 burials cease. While some of these changes may be linked with late Clemson's Island culture, they are
 more consistently linked with Stewart Phase Shenks Ferry and McFate/Quiggle manifestations, which
 Graybill (1989:53) has grouped as the West Branch tradition. In the North Branch Valley of the Susque-
 hanna Basin, cultures of the time are referred to as the Wyoming Valley Complex (Smith 1973). In the

 Lower Susquehanna Valley, a Shenks Ferry tradition distinctive from that of the West Branch is recognized,
 and involves planned and eventually fortified villages. There is a shift to more frequent interactions with
 groups in areas upriver, rather than the southern and eastern connections obvious during earlier times.

 Fortified villages appear to have temporal priority in the middle and upper sections of the valley.

 Nucleated and stockaded villages are the rule throughout the valley into the 16th century. Rather extensive
 interactions between cultures of the Susquehanna Valley and others throughout the region are implied by
 similarities in ceramic styles and community plans. However, visible evidence of trade remains problemati-
 cal.

 It is during the 16th century that the Susquehannocks, an historically known group, migrated down
 the Susquehanna Valley from southern New York, disrupting existing populations, and settling on a
 relatively permanent basis in the lower valley (Kent 1984). Their settlements are nucleated and fortified.
 The role of the Susquehannocks in regional trade is well known and their influence extended across the
 three drainage basins under consideration here.

 Potomac Valley

 In upper and middle sections of the drainage basin, small unfortified villages and/or hamlets character-
 ize community patterns prior to A.D. 1300/1400, as is the case in the northern Shenandoah Valley. In
 the Shenandoah Valley, there is evidence of a temporal progression from hamlets to villages from the onset
 of the Late Woodland period to approximately A.D. 1300. In Ridge and Valley sections of the Potomac
 drainage, burial in accretional mounds and rock cairns are outstanding traits of Late Woodland cultures.
 Burials in rock cairns also characterizes some Late Woodland cultures on the Appalachian Plateau at this
 time. Mound or cairn burials are lacking in the Piedmont of the basin's mid-range. These patterns generally
 mimic developments in middle and upper sections of the Susquehanna Valley.

 Influences on Potomac Valley cultures are clearly from cultures to the west and north. There are also

 stylistic affinities between cultures of the Monongahela drainage basin and those in the upper and/or Plateau
 sections of the Potomac Basin. Groups situated in the Ridge and Valley sections of the Potomac Basin
 are part of a generalized interaction sphere extending from south-central New York into North Carolina.
 In coastal sections of the Potomac Valley, villages appear to be lacking for the time prior to A.D.

 1300. The environmental setting of sites and the implication that cultigens are being used to some degree,
 minimally suggests the presence of hamlet types of settlements.

 By A.D. 1300/1400 mound or cairn burials have ceased and villages are now stockaded in the Upper

 Potomac and northern Shenandoah Valley. Outlying hamlets may be related to the villages. The use of
 mounds also stops in the basin's mid-range, or where the valley encompasses portions of the Ridge and
 Valley. There is evidence that at least some of the villages in this area were stockaded after A.D.
 1300/1400. In the Coastal Plain, large sites/villages are established, and it is assumed that agriculture
 is a part of the subsistence technology. This area is associated with petty chiefdoms during early historic
 times (Potter 1982).

 DISCUSSION

 The transition to Late Woodland lifestyles has been discussed in a variety of publications (Custer 1984,

 1986b, 1989, 1990; Curry and Kavanagh 1991; Gardner 1986; Johnson 1991; Potter 1982; Steponaitis
 1986; Stewart 1990b). For some areas within the region, notably the middle and upper segments of the
 Susquehanna and Potomac drainages, evidence of late Middle Woodland occupations is sketchy at best.
 It is obvious from the nature of cultural developments that are seen by A.D. 800/900, i.e., hamlet-based
 agricultural communities and stylistic similarities in ceramics throughout large sections of Appalachia,
 that there must have been resident Middle Woodland populations in these areas.

 Populations are organized in hamlets and/or villages during the initial stages of the Late Woodland
 period. For most of the Middle Atlantic Region this entails the time prior to A.D. 1200/1300. In the Upper
 Potomac and northern Shenandoah valleys, it is the time before A.D. 1300/1400. Hamlet-like settlements
 are evident on the Delmarva Peninsula, and in the Lower Delaware Valley where cultigens do not appear

 to play a role in subsistence strategies. Regardless of the specific subsistence system,, by the Late
 Woodland period all groups were operating from a sedentary base within a relatively small territory, or
 at least a territory demonstrably smaller than in previous times. In some coastal areas of the region,
 productive and predictable estuarine resources were capable of supporting sedentary populations without
 the need for agriculture.

 In contrast, there are clear differences in the degree of social complexity exhibited by prehistoric
 cultures during the first half of the Late Woodland period. Mound and cairn burials in portions of the
 Susquehanna and Potomac drainages distinguish the cultures of these areas from the remainder of the
 region. Analogies for the social systems linked with the mound builders have been drawn with "big man"
 types of societies and tribal organizations (Gardner 1986:85; Hay et al. 1987:60-62; Stewart 1990c:99-101).
 There are no appreciable differences in the intensity with which agricultural products seem to be used from
 drainage to drainage; as yet, social complexity cannot be equated confidently with productive intensification
 and the organization of work. While agriculture may be spread as part of a "package" involving plant
 technology and certain ideologies, its acceptance by groups of varying social complexity implies that it
 was viewed by Native peoples as a solution to some common economic problems.

 As Custer (1986a: 161) notes, since maize was not developed within the Middle Atlantic Region, its

 presence throughout the region at basically the same time during the Late Woodland period implies
 extensive outside interactions. In particular, the interaction of Middle Atlantic peoples with groups to the
 north in Iroquoia, and to the south and west in the Ohio Valley, is viewed as a major stimulus in the
 adoption of agriculture and the development of social complexity. The great similarity in material culture
 and adaptations throughout the Appalachian Highlands prior to A.D. 1300 is evidence of the intensity of
 these interactions.

 Between A.D. 1300 and 1400, a number of cultural changes are evident that persist until historic

 times or disruptions linked to the Susquehannock migration of the 16th century. Populations are nucleating
 throughout much of the region, settlements are larger and more planned in nature, and the occurrence
 of stockaded villages in many areas implies inter-group hostilities. Nucleation appears to occur even in
 portions of the region where settlements are not fortified, such as coastal zones of the Potomac Valley
 (Potter 1982). Also, a number of authors have presented evidence for population movements and popula-
 tion displacement at this time (for example see Clark 1980; Gardner 1986:79-80; Graybill 1989; MacCord
 1984). The effects of the Little Ice Age on climate and environment may have altered the productivity
 of agriculture in some western portions of the region where the growing season was short under normal
 conditions.

 The basic assumption made by most researchers is that population growth during early segments of
 the Late Woodland period results in the fissioning of settlements (hamlets/villages), and the expansion
 of new groups into previously unoccupied areas. Through time population densities reach the point where
 further fissioning and expansion of populations and settlements afe not possible. Evidence of increasing
 population densities is seen in the location of sedentary settlements in more peripheral environments not
 inhabited by groups earlier in the period. But these data have not been quantified; site densities cannot
 be objectively compared between the drainages of the region.

 Nucleation into planned villages, intensification of subsistence production, concomitant elaborations

 in social organization, and ultimately, inter-group conflict are the presumed results in this generalized
 scenario of Late Woodland cultural change (see for example Gardner 1986:71-92; Graybill 1992; Hatch
 1980b: 325-326). Small population movements, possibly stimulated, in part, by shortfalls in agricultural

 productivity as a result of the Little Ice Age, would have been another source of potential hostility between
 communities, and a reason for the nucleation of groups (Custer 1986a).

 The time between A.D. 1300/1400 seems to be critical throughout the Eastern Woodlands, as was
 dramatically summarized in a series of papers presented at the 1992 Society for American Archaeology

 meetings (Hart 1992). Population pressure, environmental stress, and socio-political relations were shown
 to be influential in transforming Late Woodland societies over a vast area. The significant point is that
 not all of these factçrs were operative on all of the cultures in the Eastern Woodlands; effects of the Little
 Ice Age had a dramatic effect on the functioning of agricultural societies in some northern and western
 sections of the Eastern Woodlands, while population densities are seen as influential in other areas. Each
 of these changes to individual cultures, however, had a domino effect on neighboring peoples. Abandon-
 ment of areas where the growing season was insufficient to support maize agriculture forced some groups
 into new areas and into new or different contacts with other peoples. In turn, these new socio-political
 relationships reverberated through adjacent groups where previously environment, adaptation, and society
 had been functioning on a relatively stable level. In short, the cultural landscape has filled to the point
 where changes in one part of the Late Woodland "world system" influence other components or members
 of the system. Late Woodland cultural changes in the Middle Atlantic Region must be studied and
 understood at different scales - local, regional, and the "world" (Stewart 1992).

 Defensive settlements, population nucleation, growth and/or re-organization of settlements, and
 population movements or displacement are noticeably lacking in the Delaware Valley (but see Custer 1987).
 What accounts for the cultural conservatism seen in the Delaware Valley through the Late Woodland
 period? Why don't we see the gradual population growth and expansion that is an outgrowth of small,
 agricultural communities in the Susquehanna and Potomac drainages?

 Differences in the environmental potentials between the Delaware, Susquehanna, and Potomac drainage

 basins are clearly not at the root of the matter. Further, Delaware Valley groups are interacting with
 Owasco/Iroquois to north, though apparently not in the same way that people on the Susquehanna and
 Potomac are (Stewart 1992). Explanations for these differences may relate to the nature of social organiza-
 tion at the time that agricultural communities get started. In much of the Susquehanna and Potomac basins,

 the society of the earliest farming cultures is already elaborated beyond that seen in the Delaware Valley,
 judging from the occurrence of mound burials and attendant ceremony, and the probable economic and
 social linkage of multiple communities in the western drainages. If we assume that the initial social
 complexity seen in the western drainages drives the organization of work and productive intensification,
 which in turn leads to population growth and expansion, this linkage might shed light on the slower rate
 of social and community development in the Delaware basin.

 Equally significant may be the relationship between cultures of the Delaware Valley with Owasco
 and proto-Iroquois peoples to the north. I have argued elsewhere (Stewart 1992) that the historic role of
 the Delaware or Lenape Indians in the Covenant Chain (Jennings 1984:44-45) as "middlemen" between
 the Iroquois and Algonquian groups in eastern segments of the Middle Atlantic Region may have prehistoric
 roots. The Lenape and their ancestors may have been removed, because of this, from the social and political
 tensions that led to population nucleation and the fortification of settlements elsewhere in the region.

 A better understanding of preceding Middle Woodland cultures is needed to deal with the study of

 the uneven levels of social development throughout the region, in order to make sense of the Late
 Woodland trends. Currently, the recognition of archaeological deposits dating to the time just before A.D.
 900 is especially problematic for non-coastal segments of the Susquehanna and Potomac river basins.

 The Middle Atlantic Region is a great archaeological laboratory in which to investigate the relationship

 between food production and the development of social complexity. Most of what I have been able to
 accomplish in this paper is to simply note correlations of a number of phenomena, and weave a few tales

 about where to start looking for explanations. The future of such research should prove to be interesting.
