 EARLY LANDMARKS BETWEEN GREAT

 HUNTING CREEK AND THE

 FALLS OF THE POTOMAC

 BY

 CHARLES O. PAULLIN

 (Read Before the Society, May 17, 1927.)

 It is a truism that history is a unity - that it is all of
 one piece. A single strand can not be inspected without
 learning something of the general pattern. Possibly
 papers on local history abstract their facts too much and
 fail to point out the larger connections. Even the bit of
 very local history of which this paper treats, has such
 connections.

 It would be difficult to find in American history a more

 general conception than that which is called to the mind
 by the phrase, uthe Westward Movement," meaning
 those successive waves of settlers that carried the frontier
 ever farther and farther westward. This movement be-

 gan at the Atlantic seaboard, and the American frontier
 once ran through what is now the District of Columbia.
 This paper treats of this movement as it passed along
 the south side of the Potomac through the territory op-

 posite the present District.

 Now, the Westward Movement is only one of many
 migratory movements. Indeed, it is more accurate to
 describe it as a part of one migratory movement - the
 movement of Indo-European peoples that began four
 thousand years ago on the plains of western Asia (or
 thereabouts). The immigrants that moved up the

 Potomac valley brought with them many of the basic
 words of their early nomadic ancestors. They used to
 brew an alcoholic drink made from honey, water, and
 malt. Their descendants may still brew this drink -
 privately. It is called "mead," a word that occurs in
 the American, English, Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Swed-
 ish, German, Irish, Lithuanian, Russian, Greek, Sanskrit,
 Zend and modern Persian languages, and points to some
 common connection of all these peoples. This paper,
 which treats of a small rill of this great migratory stream,
 is thus seen to be tied up with one of the most inclusive
 generalizations of world history, and is by no means ex-
 clusively local in its connections and implications.

 As geography conditions and modifies history, one can-
 not understand history without a knowledge of geog-
 raphy. The main features of the geography of the ter-
 ritory between Great Hunting Creek and the Falls of
 the Potomac are doubtless familiar. This territory is
 a part of the peninsula that is bounded on the north by
 the Potomac River, on the east by Chesapeake Bay, and
 on the south by the Rappahannock River. It has been
 long known as the Northern Neck. The location of
 the Falls of the Potomac a few miles above Washington
 is well known. Great Hunting Creek, which lies near
 the lower part of Alexandria, is the chief Virginia tribu-
 tary of the Potomac between Mount Vernon and Great
 Falls. From the mouth of the creek to Great Falls by
 way of the Potomac is a little more than twenty miles;
 and from the mouth of the creek to the mouth of the
 Potomac in Chesapeake Bay, a little more than one
 hundred miles. Above Great Hunting Creek the chief
 streams are Four Mile Run - so named because it is
 four miles above the creek - Pimmit Run which enters

 the Potomac near Chain Bridge, the Difficult Run, a mile

 or two below Great Falls. The most distinguishing
 feature of the Potomac River is its falls. Here, or
 near here, tidewater and navigation cease.

 Early in the 17th century, when history gives us our

 first view of the Potomac River valley, Indian villages
 were found at intervals between the mouth of the river

 and the falls. As a typical Indian village consisted of a
 series of wigwams and cleared fields extending along the
 river for a mile or two, no small part of the valley was
 occupied by the Indians. The lands on both sides of the
 Potomac in the neighborhood of what is now Washington
 and Alexandria was the territory of the Anacostans - a
 name with several variants. Their main towns were on
 the Maryland side of the Potomac. The uNecostins
 towne" of the early historical documents was located, ac-
 cording to Mr. Fairfax Harrison, near old Fort Wash-
 ington.1 A second village extended from Boiling Field
 up the Eastern Branch to a point near Bladensburg. On
 the Virginia side small village sites are found by archae-
 ologists near Chain Bridge, opposite Analostan Island,
 at the south end of the Highway Bridge, and near the
 mouth of Four Mile Run. There was a soapstone quarry
 near Falls Church where articles for domestic use were
 made. Many fragments and unfinished vessels have
 been found there, but no perfect vessel.2

 In the villages or cleared spots the Indians cultivated
 corn, beans, squashes and tobacco. They obtained their
 meat by fishing and hunting. Little Falls was a favorite
 fishing place. Back from the river and up from the falls
 were the hunting grounds. From the falls to the
 mountains was the great wilderness, broken however at
 a few places bv "prairies." These deforested areas were

 made by the Indians who deliberately burned off the
 trees in order to grow grass and attract buffalo and
 other herb-eating game. It is said, with some probability,
 that if the white man had postponed his coming for
 several hundred years, all Virginia would have been re-
 duced to pasture land.1

 One may lay down the general rule that the first white
 men to visit any part of America were the explorers and
 traders, that these were followed by the land speculators;
 and this crafty class, by the settlers. For the first forty
 years after the settlement at Jamestown, the York River
 was the northern frontier of the young colony. The
 Northern Neck was wild, Indian country, the favorite
 region for the operations of the explorers and traders
 of the southern settlement. The first of this class to

 navigate the Potomac River was the redoubtable Captain
 John Smith. The year was 1608, the year after James-
 town was settled. Smith's account of his voyage is not
 as specific as one would wish, and scholars dispute over
 the parts of the river visited by him. He is thought by
 many to have gone up as far as the head of navigation.
 If he did, the following extract contains the first reference
 to the region between Great Hunting Creek and the Falls
 of the Potomac :

 uThe 16[th] of June we fell [in] with the river
 Patowomek . . . Having gone so high as we could with
 the bote [that is, to Little Falls] we met divers Salvages
 in Canowes, well loaden with the flesh of Beares, Deere,
 and other beasts, whereof we had part." 2

 On the return voyage Smith mentions beavers, otters,
 martins and minks. From his narrative one may list the
 larger fauna of the Potomac valley.

 In May- June, 1632, Henry Fleet made a trading ex-
 pedition up the Potomac, and after purchasing "800
 weight of beaver" at the Necostins town he continued
 his voyage, and came to anchor at or near the present
 site of Washington. His impressions of this region were
 exceedingly favorable as may be seen from the following
 quotation :

 "This place without all question is the most pleasant
 and healthful place in all this country, and most conve-
 nient for habitation, the air temperate in summer and not
 violent in winter. It aboundeth with all manner of fish.
 The Indians in one night commonly will catch thirty
 sturgeons in a place where the river is not above twelve
 fathom broad [near Little Falls]. And as for deer,
 buffaloes, bears, turkeys, the woods do swarm with them;
 and the soil is exceedingly fertile, but above this place the
 country is rocky and mountainous like Cannida." *

 The early history of the settlement of the lower part of
 the Northern Neck is chiefly distinguished by the absence
 of definite details. About all that can be said is that

 it begins in the 1640's. One might infer that the North-
 ern Neck was being settled from the fact that in 1648 it
 was erected into a county - the county of Northumber-
 land. A year later Charles II. , then in exile in France,
 granted the Northern Neck to seven faithful cavaliers,
 including Lord Culpeper. By marriage to a Culpeper it
 finally passed into the hands of the Fairfaxes. It was
 a princely gift comprising six million acres of land, or
 twenty-one modern counties.

 As the settlers spread over the lower valley of the
 Potomac, the land speculators overran the upper valley.
 The date of their invasion of the territory above the
 mouth of Great Hunting Creek may be fixed precisely.
 It was 1657-1658. During these two years they patented

 upwards of twenty-five thousand acres of the Virginia
 lands of the Anacostans, extending up the Potomac as
 far as the neighborhood of Little Falls. Their surveys
 of their future possessions were made in boats as they
 rowed up and down the Potomac, their eyes their only
 surveying instrument. For this reason the descriptions
 in the patents are so vague and general that no precise
 locations can be derived from them. They uniformly
 call for "the freshes" of the Potomac, meaning the fresh
 water streams that flow into the Potomac. Three defi-

 nite landmarks may be identified, uthe first creek above
 Piscataway," that is Great Hunting Creek; uthe second
 creek above Piscataway," that is Four Mile Run; and
 "Anacosta Island," that is Analostan Island opposite
 Georgetown.1 The patents were based upon uhead
 rights" - the right to fifty acres of land for importing
 an immigrant. Here is an extract from a patent, granted
 on account of the transportation of ten persons, for land
 lying between the Key Bridge and Little Falls. It is
 dated March 9, 1658. Matthews is the governor.

 "Now know ye that I the said Samuel Matthews,
 Esqr., etc., give and grant unto Thomas Boswell five
 hundred acres of land, situate, lying, and being upon
 Patomack River in the Freshes above Anacosta Island,
 bounding northeasterly upon the said river, southeasterly
 upon a tract of land of ten thousand acres belonging to
 John Wood, running northwesterly along the river from
 the [sa]id ten thousand acres 125 poles, etc., southwest-
 erly from the river parallel to the ten thousand acres
 640 poles into the woods." 2

 The 10,000-acre tract of John Wood lay, as well as

 can now be determined, between Great Hunting Creek
 and a point above the Key Bridge. He was the chief

 land speculator operating in this region and his large
 tract was a consolidation of patents of his own and
 others. Of the twenty-seven patentees of 1657-1658,
 five served at one time or another in the House of Bur-

 gesses. A few of the patentees may be identified : Thomas
 Woodhouse kept the ordinary at Jamestown in which
 the House of Burgesses was at this time meeting. Hugh
 Lee was a Northern Neck merchant, though, it is be-
 lieved, not related to the distinguished Lee family.
 Henry Randolph, clerk of Henrico County, was one of
 the earliest emigrants of the Randolphs. John Custis
 of the Eastern Shore was the founder of the Custis

 family in Virginia. In 1657 he obtained a patent for
 two thousand acres "in the freshes of the Petowmack
 River above Annacosties" - Analostan Island - due for

 the transportation of forty persons.

 Matthews, one of Oliver Cromwell's Virginia gover-
 nors, disregarded the grant of the Northern Neck to the
 followers of Charles II. and issued patents in his own
 name. The patentees agreed to pay at the feast of St.
 Michael, the Archangel, a yearly rental of one shilling for

 each fifty acres, and to plant or to seat their lands within
 three years.1 The tending of one acre, no matter how
 poorly, constituted a planting. By "seating" was meant
 the building of a house and the keeping of some stock -
 a hog house with one pig would satisfy the law.

 For some reason the land speculation of 1657-1658
 proved to be ephemeral. Possibly the patentees failed to
 meet the obligations of their patents. Possibly the new
 Royalist governor under Charles II. did not respect
 the acts of the Protector's governors. Possibly the rights
 of the first patentees were satisfied. Certain it is that
 their lands were shortly repatented to other landlords.

 The historian of this region must skip the decade 1659-
 1668 and begin a new chapter with a faded document
 in quaint English script, now found in the Land Office
 at Richmond. It is described by its heading as "The
 Howsing patent for 6000 acres, lying and being on the
 freshes of the Potomac River, etc." As the title-deeds
 of the Arlington National Cemetery, the Fort Myer Mil-
 itary Reservation, and the City of Alexandria begin with
 this document, it may be quoted. The conditions of the
 patent and much legal phraseology are concealed by
 the use of "etc." :

 "To all, etc., whereas, etc. Now know yee, that I

 Robert Howsing was a Welsh sea-captain, who had
 previously seated lands in the lower part of the Northern
 Neck. A few days before the date of the patent he
 transferred his rights to John Alexander, of Stafford
 County, Virginia, it is said, for six hogsheads of tobacco.1
 One may surmise that Howsing never saw the land and
 that Alexander, who was a surveyor, located it and drew
 up the description. As the Alexanders have left their
 mark upon the territory above Great Hunting Creek, they
 must receive more than passing notice.

 They were of Scottish extraction, and, it is said, are
 descendants of Sir William Alexander and the Earls of
 Stirling. John Alexander, mentioned above, was the
 founder of the Northern Neck branch of the family.
 In 1659 he obtained a grant of fifteen hundred acres of
 land in Northampton County, Virginia, and he probably
 emigrated about that time. In 1669 he made the first
 survey of the Mount Vernon plantation. He ranks as
 one of the "gentry" of the Northern Neck, one of the
 "barons of the Potomac."

 The land boundary of this tract was and is an im-
 portant landmark. Parts of it may still be easily located.
 The upper boundaries of the Arlington Cemetery and
 the Fort Myer Reservation follow it. Going out the
 Columbia Pike, one discovers it in the road at the rear
 of the radio towers and in the line fence opposite this
 road on the left-hand side of the pike.

 For many years after the arrival of the land specu-
 lators, the settlement of the Great Hunting Creek region
 was delayed by the presence of hostile Indians. With the
 disappearance of the last of the savages, about 1700,
 no obstacle to the coming of the whites remained. It is
 said that Pearson's Island, between Alexandria and the

 mouth of Four Mile Run, was settled by Alexander
 Pearson in 1695. The fifty years following that date
 is the period of the settlement of the region above Great
 Hunting Creek. Settlers came in slowly, and in 1745
 there were only a few hundred people living between the
 creek and the falls. In that year the Howsing tract was
 still largely in the possession of the Alexanders. Two
 great grandsons of the emigrant and surveyor, John of
 Chotank and Gerard of Four Mile Run, owned most of
 it. Philip Alexander, son of John of Chotank, had a
 plantation of five hundred acres near the mouth of Great
 Hunting Creek. Several landlords had acquired parts
 of the tract through marriage with the Alexanders.

 Most of the houses on the Howsing tract were grouped
 in "quarters," or collections of houses occupied by over-
 seers, servants and slaves, and most of the owners were
 absentee landlords, who preferred to live under the
 less primitive condition^ prevailing farther down the
 Potomac. Gerard Alexander and Richard Whalen were

 the only two planters who lived on their plantations.
 Gerard was the only member of the gentry class who
 lived above Four Mile Run. He was the first resident

 above Great Hunting Creek to be elected to the House
 of Burgesses. Below the creek lay the social and political
 center of Fairfax County, where lived the Fairfaxes,
 Washingtons, Masons, and other leading families of the
 gentry.

 As the wave of settlement advanced beyond Great
 Hunting Creek, the land above the Howsing grant at-
 tracted the attention of the land speculators. Chief
 among these was Thomas Lee of Westmoreland County
 - President Lee he is usually designated, for he ended
 his life as president of the Virginia Council and acting
 governor of the colony. He was one of the greatest of

 the Virginia Lees, the father of six sons, all of whom
 figured prominently in the American Revolution. As
 the agent of the Northern Neck proprietary, the Right
 Honorable Catherine, Lady Fairfax, he naturally ac-
 quired an interest in vacant lands and the wealth to be
 derived from them. Beginning in 1717, within a few
 years he obtained possession of sixteen thousand acres
 between the Little Falls and Goose Creek, Loudoun
 County. In 1719 he was granted two hundred and
 thirty-odd acres on the Potomac River and Pimmit Run
 from a point below the Little Falls to a point above them.
 This land was acquired not so much for speculative as
 for commercial reasons. Lee had perceived that a site
 near Little Falls at the head of navigation was a strategic
 location for a town, and he hoped to make his holdings
 there a seat of commerce to which all the back country
 would be tributary.1 It is in the light of this vision of
 Lee that one can understand his famous prediction, made

 in the first half of the eighteenth century, that the colonies
 would declare their independence and would locate their
 seat of government near the Little Falls.2

 Between the Howsing tract and Little Falls, another
 noted Potomac River family, the Masons, acquired con-
 siderable holdings. These apparently began with the
 acquisition of Analostan Island, which belonged to this
 family as early as 1717, about which time the elder
 George Mason was patenting Virginia lands opposite the
 island. When the George Mason of Revolutionary fame
 died in 1792, he left some two thousand acres lying be-
 tween Four Mile Run and Little Falls, together with
 Analostan Island, to his son John Mason who was the

 father of John M. Mason, the Mason of the Mason and
 Slidell incident.1

 In the Great Falls and Difficult Run neighborhood, the
 Reverend Bryan Fairfax, eighth Lord Fairfax, had large
 holdings. These, which included the Great Falls Manor
 bordering on Great Falls, contained rather more than
 eighteen thousand acres.2 His father and brother owned
 considerable property in Alexandria.

 It was not by accident that the river frontage fell
 into the hands of the gentry. These lands were the most
 fertile and the most convenient in respect to transpor-
 tation, the chief route of which was the Potomac River.
 Lesser men had to be satisfied with less eligible locations.
 These lay up along the creeks flowing into the Potomac.
 It was during the first quarter of the eighteenth century
 that the tide of land grants passed up Four Mile and
 other runs and spread out over the heads of these streams.
 Looked at in 1745 from a distance of a few miles,
 say from the Maryland Hills across the Potomac, the
 region above Great Hunting Creek appeared to be an
 unbroken forest, save here and there a cleared field. In
 and near the cleared places were the dwellings of the
 planters. These were either log or frame houses. The
 latter were usually sheathed both inside and out. As
 the planters got ahead in the world they would refinish
 the interior of their houses with plaster made of oyster
 shells.

 In 1745 there was probably not a single house above
 Great Hunting Creek built of brick. This material was
 however much used for chimneys. The houses were
 small, consisting of from one to six rooms, and in a few
 cases more. The kitchen was built separate from the

 house, as were the quarters for the white servants and
 also those for the slaves. Near each house were several

 tobacco houses and other auxiliary structures. The
 clusters of buildings on a large plantation had the ap-
 pearance of a "considerable village," according to
 Durand, a Frenchman, who visited the lower part of
 Northern Neck in 1686.

 All domestic and farming arrangements were exceed-
 ingly primitive. There was no machinery and conse-
 quently no mechanical noises. There was no poverty.
 Every one had plenty to eat, especially of meats. Eating
 and drinking were often indulged in excessively. In the
 minor vices, according to Durand, the women showed
 the way. Respecting one of these, he writes:

 "Everyone smokes both at work and at rest. When
 I went to church (all their churches are in the woods)
 I saw the parson and all the congregation smoking in
 the churchyard while waiting for the hour of service.
 When the sermon was over, they did the same thing be-
 fore separating. There are seats provided in the church
 yards for this purpose. It was here that I saw that
 everyone smoked, women and girls and boys down to
 the age of seven years." *

 The Potomac River and the larger creeks flowing into
 it served as a common highway. All the plantations on
 these streams had boats or canoes which were used in

 carrying freight and in making visits. Land travel was
 chiefly by horseback. By 1745 the two-wheeled chaise
 was coming into use. There were but few four-wheeled
 vehicles.

 Each plantation had an orchard and kitchen garden
 in which European fruits and vegetables were grown.
 The planters raised tobacco, corn, wheat, peas, beans,

 and white and sweet potatoes. The raising of wheat
 in large quantities came later. The staple bread was corn
 bread. The use of the breaking plough was not general.1
 All crops were cultivated with the hoe, the chief farming
 implement.

 The "money crop" - that for which money could be
 obtained - was tobacco. Each large plantation on the
 main water courses had its private wharf, from which the
 tobacco was loaded on ships for export. As "out
 plantations" were brought under cultivation a device for
 transporting tobacco was invented which did not require
 wagons, then but little used. A pole was run through
 the center of a hogshead of tobacco to which rude shafts
 were attached and by means of a horse, or an ox, or
 men, the hogshead was rolled to the wharf, where "roll-
 ing houses" were built to receive it. It was a rolling
 house, or a warehouse, that served as a beginning for
 the first town in the Northern Neck above Great Hunt-

 ing Creek.

 In 1730 "Governor Gooch's Tobacco Inspection Act"
 was passed by the colony. This provided for tobacco
 warehouses and for the official inspection of the tobacco
 intended for export. One of these warehouses was to
 be located "at Great Hunting Creek, upon Broadwater's
 land." Now Broadwater's land was on the lower side

 of the creek, probably some distance up from its mouth.
 A more eligible site was therefore chosen on "Simon
 Pearson's land upon the upper side of Great Hunting
 Creek." The final site was about a mile above the mouth

 of the creek in the upper part of Old Alexandria.2

 as the Act of Union - the act that united England and
 Scotland, we find that this legislation opened up to Scot-
 land trade privileges formerly denied her. Soon Scot-
 tish ships were loading tobacco in Virginia and Scottish
 factors representing Scottish commercial houses were
 taking up a residence in the colony at the chief centers
 of trade. The erection of a new warehouse at Great

 Hunting Creek did not escape the attention of these
 canny tradesmen. About 1740 a small community,
 chiefly Scottish, established itself near the warehouse
 and engaged in buying and shipping tobacco and in sell-
 ing imported articles - dress goods, nails, reap-hooks,
 shoe-buckles, sugar, and rum. The settlement was named
 Belhaven after a famous Scottish hero.

 The enterprising Scots were not long in discovering
 what Thomas Lee had earlier seen, namely, that the
 region at the head of navigation on the Potomac was an
 eligible place for a prosperous town. There was money
 to be made in town lots. Their scheme needed the ap-

 proval of the legislature. Consequently on November 1,
 1748, there was submitted to that body a "petition of the
 inhabitants of Fairfax [County], praying that a town may
 be established at Hunting Creek warehouse on Potow-
 mack River." It was signed by Hugh West, member of
 an old Potomac River family and owner of the ware-
 house; James Pagan of a Glasgow family; John Carlisle,
 representing a Scottish Company, although born at Car-
 lisle, England; and William Ramsay, born in Kirkcud-
 brightshire, Scotland. The petition met with opposition,
 especially from Philip Alexander, who favored a site at the
 head of Great Hunting Creek. Alexander was placated
 by the naming of the town for his family. A bill em-
 bodying the necessary provisions became a law on No-
 vember 1, 1748. It vested sixty acres of land in eleven

 gentlemen as directors and trustees "for designing,
 building, carrying on, and maintaining" a town to be
 called Alexandria. The directors were carefully chosen
 with a view to promoting the enterprise. They were
 Lord Thomas Fairfax (proprietary of the Northern
 Neck), William Fairfax (agent of the proprietary),
 George William Fairfax (son of the agent), Richard
 Osborne and Lawrence Washington (influential land-
 owners), William Ramsay, John Carlyle and John
 Pagan (representing the Scots), Hugh West (owner
 of the warehouse), Gerard and Philip Alexander (rep-
 resenting the Alexanders).1

 In July, 1749, the first lots were sold. Most of .the
 influential families of the region were among the buyers
 - the Fairfaxes, Washingtons, Masons, Alexanders,
 Fitzhughs, and others. Previous to the sale George
 Washington, then seventeen years of age, had made two
 surveys of the town - one a general survey more or less
 topographical, and the other a detailed survey including
 streets and lots.2 In 1751 a lottery was held to obtain
 money for the construction of a market house and an
 Episcopal church. In 1752 John Carlyle built the Carlyle
 House, on which are still to be seen the initials, UJ. S. C."

 relic of a private house antedating the French and Indian
 War now standing above Great Hunting Creek. Sarah
 Carlyle was a daughter of William Fairfax, and Mr.
 Fairfax Harrison, president of the Southern Railway,
 is one of her descendants - and is also a descendant of

 the ninth Lord Fairfax. He is the chief authority on the
 early history of the Northern Neck, and I take this

 occasion to acknowledge my indebtedness to his writings.
 This paper is largely pilfered from them.

 The founding of Alexandria was an event of prime
 importance to the upper Northern Neck. For forty years
 the city greatly prospered and it had visions of becoming
 a future metropolis surpassing Baltimore, and of fully
 realizing on its natural advantages at the head of naviga-
 tion and at the entrance to a rich back country.1 First in
 the field, was it not destined to become the great city of
 the Potomac valley?

 The two most distinguished Potomac River families in

 American history are the Washingtons and Lees. With
 the purchase of lots in Alexandria in 1750 by Lawrence
 and Augustine Washington that family obtained its first
 holdings of land above Great Hunting Creek. The Lee
 family, as we have seen, had preceded it by several years.
 The founding of Alexandria, and in 1751, of George-
 town, four miles below Little Falls on the Maryland
 side of the Potomac did not destroy the faith of the
 Lees in their location at the falls. This region had been
 growing in commercial importance. In 1738 the first
 public ferry in Virginia north of Great Hunting Creek
 was established near the Little Falls. Two years later
 President Lee was able to secure the designation of his
 lands at the falls as the site for a public tobacco ware-

 house.2 Dying in 1750, he left to his eldest son, Philip
 Ludwell Lee, most of his estate, including his property
 at Little Falls. With the land, the son appears to have
 inherited the father's faith in its commercial possibilities,

 if we may judge from a provision of a Virginia statute
 enacted in 1772.

 "And whereas the honourable Philip Ludwell Lee,
 esquire hath laid off one hundred acres of land, adjoin-
 ing to the warehouses at the falls of Potowmack, in
 the county of Fairfax, into lots and streets for a town,
 which is called by the name of Philee: Be it further
 enacted . . . That the purchasers of the said lots, so soon
 as they shall have built upon and saved the same, ac-
 cording to the conditions of their deeds of conveyance,
 shall then be entitled to, and have and enjoy all the rights,
 privileges, and immunities, which the freeholders and in-
 habitants of other towns erected by act of assembly, in
 this colony do enjoy." *

 Beginning as a paper town, Philee always remained
 one. The heirs of Philip Ludwell Lee maintained the
 tobacco warehouse at the lower falls until it was incor-

 porated in the District of Columbia. At this time Gen-
 eral Light-Horse Harry Lee was attempting to realize
 the commercial ambition of the family by establishing a
 town at Great Falls. In 1790 the Virginia legislature
 authorized eight gentlemen trustees, including the Rev.
 Bryan Fairfax and Richard Bland Lee, son of Light-
 Horse Harry, to lay off into lots and streets a tract of
 forty acres at the Great Falls belonging to Bryan Fair-
 fax and to establish the town of Matildaville. The tract

 was adjacent to lands formerly owned by President Lee,
 which had been inherited by his grand-daughter Matilda,
 the wife of Light-Horse Harry, for whom the husband
 named the town. For a time the speculation was promis-
 ing. The Potomack Company, engaged in improving the
 navigation of the Potomac, built a canal around the falls
 and through the town. The shops and office of the
 company were located here. The locks of the canal, the
 ruins of which are still to be seen, were once regarded as
 a great feat of engineering. The completion of the Ches-
 apeake and Ohio Canal on the Maryland side of the

 Potomac, about 1830, added Matildaville to the roll of
 "dead towns," and once more the ambition of the Lees
 was frustrated.1

 Notwithstanding the great interest manifested by the
 Lees in the falls of the Potomac none of them ever lived

 there. Many of them however have lived in Alexandria
 and the adjacent country. In 1811 Light-Horse Harry
 Lee moved to Alexandria and there his sons, General
 Robert E. Lee and Rear-Admiral Sidney Smith Lee, spent
 a large part of their boyhood. There also lived his
 brother Edmund Jennings Lee, an ardent churchman.
 Among other Alexandrian Lees, are Arthur Lee, Revo-
 lutionary diplomat, and Charles Lee, Washington's
 attorney-general. The home of Ludwell Lee, son of
 Richard Henry Lee, was on Shuter's Hill, the site of
 the new Masonic Memorial to Washington. General
 Fitzhurgh Lee was born at Clermont, near Alexandria.
 There was one notable family of the old gentry stock
 that obtained a footing on the Potomac between Alex-
 andria and the falls after 1775. Mention has been made

 of the patent sued out by an early member of it, John
 Custis, the emigrant, for a tract of land above Analostan
 Island. His connection with the region was so brief that
 it may be. said that the name disappears from the land
 records with its appearance. It was his grandson,
 another John Custis, who achieved the dubious distinc-
 tion of having had the last word with his wife, by means
 of the following inscription which was put on his tomb-
 stone by his positive order : '

 "Under this marble tomb lies the body of the Hon.
 John Custis, Esqr. of the city of Williamsburg and parish
 of Bruton, formerly of Hungar's Parish on the E [astern]
 S[hore] of Virginia and Co[unty] of Northampton -

 aged 71 years and yet lived but 7 years, which was the
 space of time he kept a Bachelor's home at Arlington,
 E[astern] S[hore] of Va." x

 The grandson of this eccentric Custis was John Parke
 Custis, son of Martha Washington, who in 1774 had
 married Eleanor, daughter of Benedict Calvert, son of
 the fifth Lord Baltimore. Four years later, with a young
 wife and two baby daughters, John Parke, casting about
 for a permanent home, decided to purchase a large part
 of the estate of Gerard Alexander, Sr., which had de-
 scended to Gerard's three sons, Robert, Philip, and
 Gerard, and which lay above Four Mile Run. Each son
 owned about eleven hundred acres. Robert's plantation,
 which included the mansion house of Gerard, Sr., ex-
 tended up the Potomac from Four Mile Run; Gerard's
 extended down from the upper boundary line of the old
 Howsing tract; and Philip's lay between. Evidently
 doubting whether his negotiations would be approved by
 his step-father, General Washington, John Parke wrote
 to him under date of July 15, 1778, that the bargain with
 Robert -

 "besides the extravagancy of the price is a very dis-
 agreeable one. Nothing could have induced me to have
 given such terms, but the unconquerable desire I had to
 live in the neighbourhood of Mt. Vernon and in the
 County of Fairfax. I have agreed to give him £12 per
 acre and at the expiration of twenty four years to pay
 him the principal with compound interest. This is a hard
 and disagreeable article ... I have agreed to give
 Gerard £11 [?] per acre, the money to be paid at
 Christmas." 2

 Washington's sagacious reply is characteristic of him.
 uAs you seem so desirous of living in Fairfax, [and]
 as I know it will be an agreeable measure to your mother

 and a pleasing one to me, I am very glad to find that you
 have purchased Robt. and Gerrd. Alexander's lands, as
 they are pleasantly situated and capable of great improve-
 ment. These two gentn. not only knew how to take ad-
 vantage of the times, but resolved to profit by them here,
 early, and in time. As a friend and one who has your
 welfare at heart, let me entreat you to consider the con-
 sequence of paying compound interest. Your having 24
 yrs. to pay Mr. Robt. Alexander without his having it in
 his power to call upon you for any part of the principal
 or interest, is in my judgment an unfortunate circumstance
 for you. A dun now and then might serve as a monitor
 to remind you of the evil tendency of paying compound
 interest and the fatal consequence which may result from
 letting a matter of this sort sleep ... I presume you
 are not unacquainted with the fact of £12,000 at com-
 pound interest amounting to upward of £48,000 in twenty-
 four years. Reason therefore must convince you that
 unless you avert the evil by a deposit of the like sum in
 the loan office, and there hold it sacred to the purpose of
 accumulating interest in the same proportion you pay,
 that you will have abundant cause to repent it. No Vir-
 ginia estate (except a few under the best management)
 can stand simple interest. . How then can they bear
 rnmnoiinH interest?" x

 The Custis family must have moved into the old man-
 sion house of Gerard Alexander, Sr., soon after the pur-
 chase, for there on March 21, 1779, was born Eleanor
 Parke Custis, familiarly known as Nellie Custis. The
 Custis plantation was called Abingdon, why it is not
 known. It may possibly be derived from the Earl of
 Abingdon, who was a conspicuous friend of the patriot
 cause and frequently denounced the British policy that
 led to the American Revolution.

 In 1781 John Parke Custis died of camp fever con-

 tracted at the siege of Yorktown, and Washington

 adopted his two younger children, Nellie and George
 Washington Parke Custis. Some two years later his
 widow married Dr. David Stuart, one of the three com-
 missioners for establishing the District of Columbia. As
 the terms of the purchase of Abingdon proved to be
 ruinous to the interests of George Washington Parke
 Custis who inherited the estate, the courts of law were
 invoked for his protection. There was a trial at Alex-
 andria, at which Washington testified. Since young
 Custis, a minor, could not be bound without an act of the
 legislature, such an act was passed, November 17, 1789,
 whereby it was provided that any contract made by Dr.
 Stuart and Robert Alexander "by and with the consent
 of George Washington, esquire," should be deemed a
 valid contract.1 Abingdon now reverted to Alexander
 upon his being paid a reasonable sum for its use.

 In 1793 on the death of Robert Alexander, Abingdon
 passed into the hands of his heirs. In 1806 it was sold to
 Peter and George Wise, who later transferred it to Gen-
 eral Alexander Hunter, a descendant of the Alexanders
 and marshal of the District of Columbia, 1834-1848. He
 willed it to his brother Major Bushrod Hunter, as a
 trustee for Alexander Hunter, son of Bushrod. As both
 father and son served in the Confederate army, the
 property was confiscated by the Federal government. In
 the seventies it was recovered for Alexander Hunter by
 General James A. Garfield and Judge Jeremiah S. Black,
 who received part of it for their legal services. The
 share that fell to President Garfield was recently sold by
 his heirs.

 At the present time [1927] the old mansion house and
 its site are owned by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and
 Potomac Railroad. Situated about a quarter of a mile

 from the Potomac and affording a picturesque view of
 this river, the Eastern Branch, and the Maryland hills,
 the house is well worth a visit. There is reason for be-

 lieving that it is the oldest structure now standing be-
 tween Great Hunting Creek and the Falls of the Potomac.
 It is a typical old-style plantation house of the middle
 class - two stories high, a hall through the center, and
 brick chimneys at the ends. One is told respecting the
 bricks, with a new embroidery on an old fiction, that they
 were being imported from Scotland when the Revolution
 broke out and that on the closing of this source of supply
 by the war, additional bricks were obtained from Holland.
 The old shrubbery is gone, the box having been removed
 about five years ago.

 The 1100-acre tract that John Parke Custis purchased
 from Gerard Alexander, Jr., occupying the upper part of
 the Howsing grant, passed into the hands of his son and
 youngest child George Washington Parke Custis when
 he became of age in 1802. It was about this time that
 he began the construction of Arlington House. The
 marriage of Robert E. Lee with the daughter and heir
 of Custis established Lee at Arlington. The distance
 between Arlington and Mount Vernon, as the crow flies,
 is twelve miles - so near are the residences of the two

 leading generals of our two greatest wars.

 A word should be said about the name Arlington, now

 applied to the Virginia county opposite Washington, to a
 village in the county, to a great national cemetery, and
 to many commercial establishments in and around Wash-
 ington. Arlington House was named for the ancestral
 house of the Custises on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.
 It is usually stated that the Eastern Shore house was
 named for the Earl of Arlington. Not much is known
 of the Custis family in England except that it came from

 Gloucestershire, and that the American emigrant, John
 Custis, had a cousin who lived in Arlington in Glouces-
 tershire.1 This suggests the possibility that the name
 of the Eastern Shore house may have had a different
 origin from that usually ascribed to it.

 Washington had many connections with the territory
 about which we are writing. Alexandria was his voting
 place and market. There he attended church, and went
 to balls, dinners and races. His presence in the town is
 noted in his diary more than one hundred and fifty times.
 He owned several town lots, on one of which was his
 office.

 Early in 1775 Washington purchased of George and
 James Mercer twelve hundred acres of land lying on Four
 Mile Run, a few miles from Alexandria, in what are now
 Arlington and Fairfax counties. He planned to erect
 on the run a flour mill, a saw mill and a fulling mill.2
 Not until after the Revolution did he find time to survey
 this possession. The following extract is from his diary
 of April 22, 1785:

 "Took my instruments with intent to survey the land

 I hold on 4 Mile Run . . . Called at Alexandria and
 staid an hour or two . . . Took an early breakfast at
 Abingdon ; and accompanied by Doctr. Stewart and Lund
 Washington, and having sent for Mr. Moses Ball (who
 attended), I went to a corner of the above land, within
 about 3 poles of the Run (4 Mile Run) a white oak, 18
 inches in diameter, on the side of a hill abt. 150 yards
 below the ruins of an old mill and 100 below a small
 branch which comes in on the No. Et. side. And having
 run one course and part of another, my servant William
 (one of the chain carriers) fell, and broke the pan of his
 knee, wch. put a stop to my surveying: and with much

 difficulty I was able to get him to Abingdon, being
 obliged to get a sled to carry him on, as he could neither
 walk, stand, or ride." *

 The reader will doubtless have little difficulty in
 identifying the names of the persons mentioned, but he
 might be unable to identify the site of the uwhite oak"
 from the following inscription on a monument which
 stands a good many feet from the correct position :

 "On this spot stood an oak tree bearing a survey mark
 made by George Washington, which became a monu-
 mental survey mark named in many deeds - erected by
 the Glencarlyn Cooperative Association - approved by
 N.S. D.A.R." 2

 Washington surveyed this tract in 1786 and again in
 1799, and a reproduction of his plat of the last survey
 has been published. He willed the tract long known as
 "Washington Forest" to George Washington Parke
 Custis, from whom it passed to Mrs. Robert E. Lee, and
 from her to her son George Washington Custis Lee.
 During the Civil War it was confiscated by the Federal
 government, but later was restored to Custis Lee, who in
 1880 sold the mill and its site to J. W. Barcroft of Yoko-
 hama, Pennsylvania, who changed the name "Arlington
 Mills to "Barcroft Mills." 3

 In 1760 or 1761 Washington purchased of Bryan
 Fairfax a tract of three hundred acres on Difficult Run
 below Great Falls. His last connection with this farm is

 a melancholy one. On November 7, 1799, he surveyed
 the farm - his last survey. On his way home he visited
 Washington for the last time.

 District of Columbia was, as is well known, the work of

 President Washington. The original act limited the
 choice of a site to some place on the Maryland side of
 the Potomac between the mouth of the Eastern Branch

 and the mouth of the Conococheague Greek above Har-
 per's Ferry. After mature consideration Washington
 chose a site that included land below the Eastern Branch

 and also land on the Virginia side of the Potomac, ex-
 tending from Great Hunting Creek to Little Falls. In
 an amendatory act Congress gave its consent to this in-
 clusion.1

 The location of the capital city near Georgetown and
 on the Maryland side of the river seems not to have been
 regarded as inimical to the interests of Alexandria, since
 that city might become the port and commercial
 emporium of the new district. It can now be seen
 however that in the long run the capital city of the United
 States was destined to overshadow the chief port of the
 Northern Neck. The recession of the Virginia part of
 the district to Virginia in 1846, greatly desired by the
 Alexandrians because they felt that they were slighted by
 the national government, was the result of a narrow and
 short-sighted view of their own interests. As a part of
 the district, they would now have a call on the fat pocket-
 book of a great nation instead of having to look to the
 lean wallet at Richmond.

 The failure of water transportation in the upper
 Potomac valley blasted any prospects Alexandria may
 have had of becoming a great port. The first trans-
 portation scheme which involved improved stream navi-
 gation with canals around the falls, was foredoomed to
 fail because it was impracticable, although it received the
 hearty approval of Washington. The second scheme, a
 continuous canal with locks, by reason of the years wasted

 on the first scheme, came too late, for such a canal could
 not compete with the railway, and the commerce that
 earlier might have come to Alexandria went to Balti-
 more.1

 No one with an historical turn of mind who at the

 present time passes through the region between Great
 Hunting Creek and the Falls of the Potomac can resist
 comparing its animated present with its tranquil past.
 The old Howsing tract is now divided into many thou-
 sands of holdings, large and small. At its lower end is
 the city of Alexandria, which, aroused from its lethargy
 by the World War, is growing rapidly and bids fair to
 become one of the industrial centers of Greater Wash-

 ington. On the upper end of the Howsing tract are the
 Arlington Cemetery, the Fort Myer Military Post, and
 the radio towers. Along the Alexandria turnpikes pass
 throughout the day and a large part of the night, in-
 numerable busses, motors and trucks. Many trains of
 steam cars belonging to half a dozen railway systems
 daily enter this gateway to the South. "Greater Wash-
 ington," which now includes all the Virginia part of the
 Old District, is even greater than the city predicted by
 the most far-seeing of the early pioneers.
