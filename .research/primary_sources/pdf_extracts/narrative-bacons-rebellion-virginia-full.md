 NARRATIVE OF BACON'S REBELLION.

 [WINDER PAPERS, VIRGINIA STATE LIBRARY.]

 A TRUE NARRATIVE OF THE RISE, PROGRESSE, AND CES-

 SATION OF THE LATE REBELLION IN VIRGINIA, MOST

 HUMBLY AND IMPARTIALLY REPORTED BY HIS MAJESTYES

 COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED TO ENQUIRE INTO THE AF-

 FAIRES OF THE SAID COLONY.

 In all due observance of his Most Sacred MatIe commands,

 wee have imployed our best endeavours to informe ourselves

 (for his Royal Satisffaction) by the most knowing, credible and

 indifferent Persons in Virginia of the true state of affairs in that

 his Majestyes Colony, and of such other matters as occasioned

 the late unhappy Divisions, Distractions and Disorders amolig

 the People there; which as farr as wee can possibly collect from

 a strict Inquiry, observation, examination and the most proba-

 ble impartial Reports by us made & received during our stay

 upon the Place, seems to take its original Rise, as followeth,

 vizt:

 Few or none had bin the Damages sustained by the English
 from the Indians, other than occasionally had happen'd some-

 times upon private quarells and provocations, untill in July,
 I675, certain Doegs & Susquahanok Indians on Maryland side,

 ginia shore (as the River divides the same), were pursued by the

 English in a Boate, beaten or kill'd and the hoggs retaken from

 them; whereupon the Indians repairing to their owne Towne,

 report it to their Superiors, and how that one Mathewes (whose

 hoggs they had taken) had before abused and cheated them, in

 not paying them for such Indian trucke as he had formerly

 bought of them, and that they took his hogs for Satisfaction.

 Upon this (to be Reveng'd on Mathews) a warr Captain with

 some Indians came over to Potomake and killed two of Math-

 ewes his servants, and came also a second time and kill'd his

 sonne.

 It happen'd hereupon that Major George Brent* and Col.

 George Mason t pursued some of the samne Indians into M-ary-

 land, and marching directly up to the Indian Towne with a

 Party of 30 Virginians came to a certaine House and there kllled

 t Colonel George Mason, a native of Staffordshire, England, who is
 said to have commanded a troop of horse in the royal army during the

 civil war, came to Virginia about I651, settled in Stafford coutnty, and
 became a prominent man in that section. He was a member of the

 Northern Neck Committee (for the local government and protection of

 the Northern Neck) in I667; sheriff of Stafford I669, and member of the

 House of Burgesses for that county in I676. He was also colonel of the

 militia of that county. There is on record in Westmoreland a deposi-

 tion of Major George Mason, dated August 20, i658, in which he states
 that his age was twenty-nine. A record in Westmoreland, dated i655,
 shows that his wife was named Mary. He died i686. He was the an-
 cestor of a distinguished family which included George Mason, of
 " Gunston Hall," author of the Virginia Bill of Rights; Thomson
 Mason, judge of the General Court of Virginia; Stevens Thomson Ma-
 son, member of the Virginia Convention of 1788, and U. S. Senator;
 Armistead Thomson Mason, colonel U. S. A., and U. S. Senator; Ste-
 vens Thomson Mason, Jr., captain U. S. A., mortally wounded at Cerro
 Gordo, Mexico; Richard B. Mason, brigadier-general U. S. A., and first
 American governor of California; James Murray Mason, U. S. Senator,

 an Indian King and i( of his men upon the place; -the rest of

 the Indians fled for their lives. On this occasion the Governor

 of Maryland writes a Letter to Sr Wm. Berkeley, complayning

 of this rash action and intrusion of the Virginians on his Prov-

 ince without his leave or knowledge, the Indians and them being

 at that time in Peace. By what authority Brent and Mason went

 over into Maryland and kill'd those Indians is an Article of In-

 quiry in the Rappahanock Grievances and the supposed originall

 cause of the many murders that ensued in that county as them-

 selves complaine.

 The Indians persisting to Revenge themselves Inforted in

 Maryland and now began to be bold and formidable to the Eng-

 lish who Besieged them; their Boldness and daring behavior of

 late tymes and their promptnesse to Fire arms, being (indeed)

 wonderfull, over what they seem'd formerly, indued with which

 doubtlesse was of some advantage extraordinary to them con-

 sidering their Small Body.

 The Virginians and Marylanders that Besieged them being said

 to make a neer a thousand men. The siege held 7 weekes, dur-

 ing which tyme the English lost 50 men, besides some Horses

 which the Indians tooke, and serv'd themselves to subsist on.

 But Provisions growing very scarce with them during this siege

 the Indians sent out 5 greate men to Treate of Peace, who were

 not Permitted to return to the Fort, but being kept Prisoners

 Some tyme were at last murdered by the English.

 At length (whether through negligence or cowardize) the In-

 dians made theire escape through the English, with all their

 wives, children and goods of value, wounding and killing some

 at their sally and going off. After which the English returning

 (as Report Saith), the Marylanders composed a Peace with the

 Salvages, and soe diverted the warr from themselves.

 As yet the General Peace and Government of Virginia con-

 tinued undisturb'd, onely some ignorant People grumbl'd at the

 6OIb of Tob. p. pole, that necessary Tax, raised at two paymtu to

 take off the Patents granted to the Lord Arlington and Lord

 Culpepper and the Earl of St. Albans & Lord Berkly &c.

 But about the beginning of January, I675-6, a Party of those

 abused Susquahanocks in Revenge of the Maryland businesse

 Rappahanock & Potomaque and killed at one time 36 persons

 and then immediately (as their Custome is) ran off into the

 woods.

 Noe sooner was this Intelligence brought to the Governour

 but he immediately called a court and ordered a competent force

 of horse and foot to pursue the Murderers under the Comand of

 Sr Henry Chicheley * and some other Gentlemen of the County

 of Rappahanock, giving them full Power by Comission to make

 Peace or Warr. But the men being ready to march out upon

 this Service the Governor on a suddaine recalls this comission,

 Causes the men to be disbanded, and without any effectual course

 being taken for present Preservation, referrs all to the next as-

 sembly; in the meantime leaving the Poore Inhabitants under

 continual and deadly feares and terrors of their Lives.

 In soe much that in the upper Parts of the Parish of Cittern-

 borne in Rappahanock wch consisted of 7I Plantations, on the

 24th of Jan., I675-6, by the ioth of Febr following was reduced

 to eleven what with those that ran away into the heart of the

 country, and such as stay'd and were cut off by the Enemy.

 the Assembly tooke to prevent these massacres was onely to
 build Forts at the heads of each River and on the Frontiers and
 confines of the country, for erecting of wob and maintaining
 Guards on them a heavie leavy was laid by act of Assembly on
 the People; throughout the country universally disliked before

 very heart and centre of the country, their sculking nature being

 apt to use these advantages.

 The Murders, Rapines and outrages of the Indians became

 soe much the more Barbarous, fierce and frequent, by how much

 the more they perceived the Public Preparations of the English

 against them, Prosecuting their mischiefs upon the extreem Plan-

 tations thereby forcing many to dessert them to their Ruines,
 and destroying those that adventur'd to stay behind.

 The unsatisfied People finding themselves still lyable to the
 Indian Crueltyes, and the cryes of their wives and children grow-

 ing grievous and intollerable to them, gave out in Speeches that

 they were resolved to Plant tobacco rather than pay the Tax for

 maintaining of Forts, and yt the erecting of them was a great

 Grievance, Juggle and cheat, and of no more use or service to

 them than another Plantation with men at it, and that it was

 merely a Designe of the Grandees to engrosse all their Tobacco

 into their owne hands.

 Thus the sense of this oppression and the dread of a comon
 approaching calamity made the giddy-headed multitude madd,

 and precipitated them upon that rash overture of Running out

 upon the Indians themselves, at their owne voluntary charge

 and hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, onely they first by Pe-

 tition humbly craved leave or comission to be ledd by any
 comander or comanders as the Governor should please to ap-

 point over them to be their Chieftaine or Generall. But instead

 of Granting this Petition ye Governor by Proclamation under

 great Penalty forbad the like Petitioning for the future.

 This made the People jealous that the Governor for the lucre
 of the Beaver and otter trade &c. with ye Indians, rather sought
 to protect the Indians than them. Since after publick Procla-
 mation prohibiting all trade with the Indians (they complaine)
 hee privately gave comission to some of his Friendes to truck
 with them, and that those persons furnished the Indians with

 Powder, Shott &c. soe that they were better provided than his

 Majestye's Subjects.

 The People of Charles City County (neer Merchants Hope)
 being devised a Commission by the Governor although he was
 truly informed (as by a Letter of his to his Ma"0 he confesseth)

 tations, and knew not where the Storme would light, they begin

 to beat up drums for Volunteers to goe out against the Indians

 and soe continued Sundry dayes drawing into armes, the Mag-

 istrates being either soe remise or of the Same faction, that they

 suffered this disaster wthout contradiction or endeavouring to

 prevent soe dangerous a begining & going on.

 The Rout being got together now wanted nor waited for noth-

 ing but one to head and lead them out on their design. It soe

 happen'd that one Nathaniel Bacon Junr, a person whose lost
 and desperate fortunes had thrown him into that remote part of

 the world about 14 months before, and fram'd him fitt for such a

 purpose, as by the Sequel will appeare, which may make a short

 character of him no impertinent Digression.

 Hee was a person whose erratique fortune had carryed and

 shewne him many Forraigne Parts, and of no obscure Family.

 Upon his first comming into Virginia hee was made one of the

 Councill, the reason of that advancemenit (all on a suddain) be-

 ing best known to the Governour, which honor made him the

 more considerable in the eye of the Vulgar, and gave some ad-

 vantage to his pernicious designes. Hee was said to be about

 four or five and thirty yeares of age, indifferent tall but slender,

 blackhair'd and of an ominous, pensive. mnelancholly Aspect, of

 a pestilent & prevalent Logical discourse tending to atheisme in

 most companyes, niot given to much talke, or to make suddain

 replyes, of a most imperious and dangerous hidden Pride of

 heart, despising the wisest of his neighbours for their Ignorance,

 and very ambitious and arrogant. But all these things lay hidd

 in him till after hee was a councillor, and untill he became pow-

 erfull & popular.

 * Captain James Crews, of Turkey Island, Henrico county, was a near
 neighbor of Nathaniel Bacon, and was one of his most active adherents
 during the rebellion. His will, dated July 23, 1676, was proved in Hen-
 rico December Io, i677. He bequeaths to Mary, wife of Giles Carter,
 4,000 lbs. of tobacco and certain household goods; to Susan, daughter
 of Giles Carter, I,ooo lbs tobacco; gives his man his freedom; gives
 Hannah, wife of Giles Carter, his negro maid, Kate; to Daniel Prince

 nesse of the times their discourse, and the ffear they all lived in,

 his best suit and coat; to Giles Carter all that he (Carter) owed him, and
 gives him for life the plantation he has " let " him; all the remainder of
 his estate to his cousin, Matthew Crews, and makes him executor. On
 January 24, I676, James Crews was tried as a rebel by a court-martial at
 Green Spring, and was sentenced to death. April i, i68i, there is an
 entry in the records of Henrico, stating that as Captain James Crews
 had died unmarried, administration on his estate is granted to Mr. Wil-
 liam Sherwood, attorney for Rowland Place, Esq., who was attorney for

 Matthew Crews, gent., son of Francis Crews, deceased, brother of Cap-
 tain James Crews, and to Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Grendon, attor-
 ney for Sarah Whittingham, sole daughter of Edward Crews, brother to
 Captain James Crews. These heirs lived in England.

 t Henry Isham, Sr., came to Virginia about I656, when he had a grant

 of land. It appears from the will of Sir Edward Brett, of Blendenhall,
 Kent, England, which was dated December 22, I682, and proved March
 17, I683 (printed in the New England Historical and Genealogical Reg-
 ister for July, I89o), that the latter (who was knighted by the King
 August 31, i644, after distinguishing himself in a charge on the Parlia-
 mentary forces at Lostwithiel, Cornwall) was the uncle of Henry Isham,
 of Virginia. In his will Sir Edward makes bequests to the children of
 his niece, Ann, daughter of his sister, Mary Isham, and ?2oo apiece to the
 two daughters of his nephew, Henry Isham, late of Virginia, deceased,
 by Katherine, his wife. It appears from Blayde's Genealogia Bedford-
 iensis that Mary, sister, of Sir Edward Brett, married William Isham.
 Henry Isham, the elder, of Virginia, married Katherine, widow of Jos-

 eph Royall, of Henrico county, and died about I675. There is on record
 in Henrico, dated September ii, 1677, a receipt from the executors of
 Captain Henry Isham, deceased. Also a deed, dated September 20,
 1678, from Samuel Turke, of Gandchurch, Kent, England, administrator
 of Henry Richards, of London, merchant, &c., to Henry Isham, of
 London, merchant, conveying, for a consideration of ?140, all goods
 and money and tobacco bills in Virginia, due said Richards, &c., which
 were left by Samuel Swane, of London, merchant, deceased, in the cus-
 tody of Henry Isham, the elder, merchant, late of Virginia, deceased,
 father of the aforesaid Henry Isham. And another deed, dated Sep-
 tember 23, i678, to Henry Isham of London, merchant, only son and
 executor of Henry Isham, late of Virginia, gentleman. The will of
 Henry Isham (Jr.) is on record in Henrico, dated November 13, I678,
 and proved February i, I678-9. He gives his half brother, Joseph Roy-
 all, ?40 worth of goods; to "my honored mother Mrs. Katherine

 Falls of James River, and comitted many murders upon ym;

 be true to him, and if hee could not obtain a Comission they

 would assist him as well and as much as if he had one; to which

 Bacon agreed.

 This fforwardnesse of Bacons greatly cheer'd and animated

 the People, who looked upon him as the onely Patron of the

 Country and preserver of their Lives and Fortunes.

 For he prtended and bosted what great Service hee would doe

 for the country, in destroying the Comon Enemy, securing their

 Lives and Estates, Libertyes, and such like fair frauds hee sub-

 tily and Secretly insinuated by his owne Instruments over all the

 county, which he seduced the Vulgar and most ignorant People

 to believe (two thirds of each county being of that Sort) Soe

 that theire whole hearts and hopes were set now upon Bacon.

 Next he charges the Governour as negligent and wicked, treach-

 erous and incapable, the Lawes and Taxes as unjust and oppres-

 sive and cryes up absolute necessity of redress.

 Thus Bacon encouraged the Tumult and as the unquiet crowd

 follow and adhere to him, he listeth them as they come in upon

 a large paper, writing their name circular wise, that their Ring-

 Leaders might not be found out.

 Having conjur'd them into this circle, given them Brandy to

 wind up the charme, and enjoyn'd them by an oth to stick fast

 together and to him, and the othe being administered, he went

 and infected New Kent County ripe for Rebellion.

 Bacon having gott about 300 men together in armes prepared

 to goe out against the Indians, the Governour and his Friends

 endeavour to divert his designes, but cannot.

 Hee Proclames Bacon and his Followers Rebells and Muti-

 neers for going forth against the Indians without a Commission,

 and (getting a company of Gentlemen together) the Governor

 marcheth up to the Falls of James River to pursue and take

 Bacon, or to Seize him at his Returne; but all in vaine, ffor

 Bacon had gott over the River with his Forces and hastning

 away into the woods, went directly and fell upon the Indians

 and killed some of them who were our best ifriends of Indians

 and had fought ag' the Susquahanocks enemyes to the English.

 be Placed in the new erected Forts, enjoyning them not to make

 any attempt upon the Indians untill they should first give the

 Governor an account thereof, and receive orders from him

 therein, Put many to a stand, made the People expostulate and

 say how shall wee know our enemyes from our Friends, are not

 the Indians all of a colour, & if wee must not defend ourselves

 before they oppose us, they may take their usual advantage of

 surprize, and soe destroy us ere wee are capable of making any

 resistance; Soe that after all that charge in erecting of Forts,

 after all the Troubles of the Congresse of our forces, after all

 their toyle and diligence used in discovering the enemy (who

 are seldome to bee dealt with but in their owne way of surprize)

 the very point of Execution was to be determined of by a per-

 son residing in all likelihood at least a ioo miles distant from the

 Place of action, to the losse of opportunityes and utter discour-

 agement of the soldiers & ourselves. Besides of what Security

 were these Forts like to be, when the Indians cutt off and de-

 stroy'd divers people within a small distance of the Forts and

 some of the very Soldiers in them, and they not daring to stir

 out to relieve any that were in danger and distresse, themselves

 being scarce secure upoIn the Place they were Posted on. Nor

 would the people understand any distinction of ffriendly Inldians

 and Indian Enemyes, for at that tyme it was impossible to dis-

 tinguish one nation from another, they being deformed with

 Paint of many colors, and at best (say they) who is hee that can

 doe it, for there was never any open or free Trade among us

 that we might know them, But the whole Trade monopolized by

 the Governour and Grandees.

 Soe the comimon cry and vogue of the Vulgar was away with

 these Forts, away with these distinctions, wee will have warr

 with all Indians which come not in with their armes, and give

 Hostages for their Fidelity and to ayd against all others; we will

 spare none, and wee must bee hang'd for Rebells for killing

 those that will destroy us, let them hang us, wee will venture

 that rather than lye at the mercy of a Barbarous Enemy, and be

 murdered as we are &c. Thus went the ruder sort raging and
 exclaimiiing agt. the Indians, expressing the calamity that befell
 New Enigland by them. While the Governour was in the Upper
 Parts to wait Bacon's returne the people. below began to draw

 into armes, and to declare against the Forts. Hee to appease

 the comotions of the People leaves off that designe and comes

 immediately back to his own house, and caused at his returne

 the Surry and other Forts to be forthwith dismantled, and dis-

 solving the assembly that enacted thenm, gave the country a free

 new election, which new assembly were to be for the Settlement

 of the then distracted condition of Virginia.

 At this new election (such was the Prevalency of Bacon's

 Party) that they chose instead of Freeholders, Free men that

 had but lately crept out of the condition of Servants, (which

 were never before Eligible) for their Burgesses and such as were

 eminent abettors to Bacon, and for faction and ignorance fitt

 Representatives of those that chose them.

 At the Same time Bacon being come back from his Indian

 march with a thousand braging lyes to ye credulous Silly People

 of what feats he had perform'd, was by the Inhabitants of the

 county of Henrico chosen a Burgess, as was also Crews for the

 Same county.

 The assembly being mett Bacon comes down in a sloope to
 James Towne. But the People beinig very Fond of him, would

 not trust his person without a Guard, fearing some violence

 should be offered him by the Governour for what hee had al-

 ready acted against his will, and Soe sent fforty armed men

 along in the Sloope with Bacon, coming somewhat neerer to

 Towne than Swanns Point dropt anchor and sent (as tis said)

 on Shore to the Governour to know if he might in safety come

 on shore, and sett as a Member &c. What answer was return'd

 from on Board, and soe tooke him and all his men Prisoners and

 brought them away to the Governor at Towne.

 Bacon being delivered up Prisoner to the Governor by Capt.

 Gardner, the Governor lifting up his hands and eyes said in the

 hearing of many people, Now I behold the greatest Rebell that

 ever was in Virginia, who (with a dejected look) made noe Re-

 ply, till after a short pause the Governour ask'd Bacon these

 words: Sir, doe you continue to be a Gentleman, and may I

 take your word? if soe you are at Liberty upon yor owne parrol.

 Bacon feignes a most deep senise of shame and sorrow for his

 Guilt, and expresses the greatest kind of obligacion to Gratitude
 towards the Governour imaginable. And to make it looke the

 more reall and sincere drew up an humble Submission for and

 acknowledgem't of his soe late crimes and disobedience, implor-
 ing thereby the Governor's Pardon and ffavor, which Baconi

 being in readynesse to Present on his coming before the Gover-

 nor hee told the Councill then Sitting, Now you shall see a Pen-

 itent Sinner.

 Whereupon Bacon in very humble manner and with many low

 bowings of his Body approacht the Governor and on his knee

 gave up his Parasiticall Paper into the Governor's hands, and

 soe withdrew himself.

 After a short while hee was sent for in againe and had his par-

 don confirmed to him.

 wonder of all men.

 Now Capt. Gardner instead of a Reward for the Service hee

 performiied in taking and bringing away Bacon Prisoner was suf-
 fered to be ffined 703b damage for seizing him and the Sloope,
 although Capt. Gardner had discharged himself of her, the sd
 sloope being afterwards by a storme drove on shore and lost.*

 However soe powerfull (it seems) was Bacon' s interest in this new

 assembly that he procured a Public order to passe ag't Gardner
 for the payment of the 701b where upon he threw Gardner into

 goale till he found Security for his Enlargement. But when

 they understand that the Governor had not onely sett him ffree,
 but readmitted him into the Councill, with Promise also of a

 commission to be given him to goe out against the Indians, the

 People were so well pacified for the pr'sent as that every man

 uth great gladnesse return'd to his owne home.

 Bacon attending at Towne for a Comission (wch the Governor

 is said to have promised him) & being delayed or putt off, was

 secretly whispered to by some of his ffriends that those delayes
 would endanger his Life, and that if speedily he endeavour'd

 not to prevent it, there was a conspiracy to murder him on such
 a night; upon wob hee privately leaves the Towne. Now whether
 this was onely a rais'd rumor of Bacon's, or a reall truth wee

 cannot determine, but being rais'd after Bacon was gone we sup-
 pose it false.

 Hee no sooner was come to the upper Parts of James River,
 but the impatient people run to him to ask how affairs Stood,
 exclaiming still more & more against the Indians, and desired to

 know if he had yet a comission, and understanding he had or

 could not obtaine any, they began to sett up their throats in one

 comon kry of othes and curses and cry'd out aloud that they
 would either have a comission for Bacon that they might serve

 under his conduct or else they would pull downe the Towne or

 doe worse to some if they had it not, and if Bacon would goe
 but with them they would gett him a commission. Thus the
 Raging Tumult came downe to Towne (Sitting the assembly)
 and Bacon at the head of them, having entred the Towiie, hee
 Seises and secures the Principal Places and avenues, setts Senti-
 nells and sends forth scouts, so that noe Place could bee more
 Securely guarded.

 Having soe done, hee drawes up all his men in armes against
 the State house where the Governor councell and Burgesses were
 then assembled and Sitting, and sends in to the Assembly to know
 if now they would grant him a commission which Sr. Wm.
 Berkeley utterly refused, and rising from his chair of judicature
 came downe to Bacon, and told him to his fface and before all
 his men that hee was a Rebell and a Traytor &c. and should
 have noe commission, and uncovering his naked Bosome before
 him, required that some of his men might shoot him, before

 ever he would be drawne to signe or consent to a commission for

 such a Rebell as Bacon, noe (said the Governor) lett us first try

 and end the difference singly between ourselves, and offer'd to

 measure swords with him; all the answer Bacon gave the Gov-

 ernor was Sir, I came not, nor intend to hurt a haire of yo'r

 honor's head, and for yor sword yor Honor may please to putt

 it up, it shall rust in the scabbard before ever I shall desire you

 to drawe it. I come for a commission against the Heathen who

 dayly inhumanely murder us and spill our Brethrens Blood, and

 noe care is taken to prevent it, adding God damne my Blood I

 came for a commission, and a commission I will have before I

 goe, and turning to his soldiers, said make ready and Present,

 which they all did. Some of the Burgesses looking out at the

 windows and seeing the soldiers in that posture of Firing cry'd

 out to them, For God's sake hold your handes and forebear a

 little, and you shall have what you please. Much hurrying,

 solicitation and importunity is used on all sides to the Governor

 to grant Bacon a commission. At last the Governor consents,

 a commission is drawne up and sent him, he dislikes it, they pray

 him to draw or direct one himself and the Governor should signe

 it. Whereupon Bacon drawes up the contents of a commission

 according to his owne mind, and returnes it to the Clerke, to

 prepare one by, which is done, liked of and received.

 After the Governor had signed the Principall Commission to

 Bacon, hee is also pleas'd to signe 30 commissions more [Blank]

 for officers that were to serve under him.

 But Bacon finding occasion for more, sent to S' William Berk-

 ley to signe others also, who said hee had signed enough already,

 and bid him signe the rest himself if hee would.

 The assembly also passe orders to raise or presse iooo men,

 and to raise Provisions &c. for this intended service ag' the In-

 dians wherein severell of the councell and assembly-members

 were concerne'd and acted in the promoting this designe, en-

 couraging others to list themselves into Bacon's service, and
 particularly one Ballard who endeavoure'd to perswade some

 (who scrupled the Legality of Bacon's commission) that it was
 fairly and freely granted by Governor, Councill and Burgesses,

 this Ballard being one of the councill, and of those that both

 tooke and administer'd Bacon's Oath.

 There was also an act of Indempnity pass'd to Bacon and his

 Loyalty writ to the King and signed by the Governor and as-

 sembly.

 Governors own signing and seal'd with the Publick seal of the

 Colony coming to them, they were the more easily inclined to

 swallow down so fair a bait not seeing Rebellion at the end of it,

 and most men grew ambitious of the service as thinking it both

 safe and for the Publick good as having the approbation of the

 Governor and assembly, at least there yet appeared nothing to

 ye contrary nor of a good while after.

 Severall Volunteers and Reformadoes come in to list them-

 selves under Bacon, and many were press'd into this service, till

 at last having his complement of men, and all things else being

 in readynesse according as the Assembly had provided for this

 expedition. A general Rendezvous is appointed by Bacon at

 the ffalls of James River, where all things being well appointed
 for the march, Bacon makes a speech to his men, Assuring

 them all of his Loyalty to his Prince, declaring to them that his

 designe was no other than merely to serve his King and coun-
 try and to cleere all suspicion of the contrary (if any were
 amongst them) by what had bin by him already acted or Pro-

 clamed against him, as also of what he said about the procuring
 his comission; hee urges to them the reasons that induced it, the
 necessity of that tynme that compell'd him, the negligence and
 coldnesse of others that hated him and the cryes of his Breth-
 rens blood that alarm'd and waken'd him to this Publique re-
 venge, using what motives hee could to raise up the spirits of
 his men. And finally before them all tooke the oath of allegi-

 ance and supremacy, willing his soldiers also to doe the like,
 which having freely comply'd with Hee drew up an oath of Fi-
 delity to himselfe, which hee (as their head & Generall) required
 them to take; it comprehended the following contents or heads:

 That they should not conceale any Plot or conspiracy of hurt

 against his Person, but immediately reveale the same to him or

 such others by whome he might come to the knowledge of it.

 That if any harme or damage was intended towards any of his

 men, whether by surprizal or otherwise, or any conference used,

 That noe commerce or correspondence should be had with the

 That no news or information should be sent out least himself

 Repute or otherwise.

 All Councells, Plotts and conspiracyes known of the Heathen,

 to discover them, &c.

 Just now (even on the very night before their goinlg out on the

 intended march ag' the Indians) a messenger comes Post from

 Gloster Countyes bringing Intelligence to Bacon, that the Gov-

 ernor was there endeavouring to raise Forces to come and sur-

 prize him and his men and that hee was resolved by Force to

 take his extorted commission away from him, For that the whole

 county had Petitioned agt him as a Rebell and a Traytor &c.

 This amusing message was noe sooner brought to Bacon, but

 immediately he causes the Drums to Beat and Trumpett to

 Sound for calling his men together to whome he spake after this

 manner:

 Gentlemen and Fellow Soldiers: The Newes just now brought

 mee may not a little startle you as well as myselfe. But seeing

 it is not altogether unexpected, wee may the better beare it and

 provide our rernedies. The Governour is now in Gloster County

 eiideavouring to raise Forces against us, having Declared us

 Rebells and Traytors: if true, crimes indeed too great for Par-

 don; our consciences herein are our best witnesses, and theres

 soe conscious, as like cowards therefore they will not have the
 courage to face us. It is Revenge that hurryes them on with-
 out regard to the Peoples Safety, and had rather wee should be
 murder'd and our ghosts sent to our Slaughter'd country-men

 by their actings, than wee live to hinder them of their Interest
 with the heathen, and preserve the remaining part of our ffellow
 Subjects from their crueltyes. Now then wee must bee forced
 to turne our swords to our owne defence, or expose ourselves to

 their Mercyes, or Fortune of ye woodes, whilest his majestyes

 country here lyes in Bloode and Wasting (like a candle) at both

 ends. How Incapable wee may be made (if wee should pro-

 ceede) through Sicknesse, want of Provisions, Slaughter, wounds

 lesse or more, none of us is void of the Sense hereof.

 Therefore while wee are sound at heart, unwearyed and not

 receiving damage by the fate of Warr, lett us descend to know
 the reasons why such Proceedings are used against us. That

 those whome they have raised for their Defence, to Preserve

 them against the Fury of the Heathen they should thus seeke to

 Destroy, and to Betray our Lives whome they raised to Preserve

 theirs. If ever such Treachery was heard of, such wickednesse

 and inhumanity (and call all the former ages to Witnesse) and if

 any, that they suffered in like nature as wee are like by the

 sword and Ruines of warr.

 But they are all damn'd Cowards, and you shall see they will

 not dare to meete us in the Field to try the Justnesse of our

 cause and soe wee will downe to them &c. To which they all

 cry'd Amen, amen, wee are all ready and will rather die in the

 Field than be hang'd like Roges, or Perish in the woods, ex-

 pos'd to the Favours of the mercylesse Indians.

 How unhappy, unsuccessfull and how fatale this avocation

 prov'd the consequence will but too Plainly Shewe. For Bacon

 (then the hopes of the People) was just upon the Point of march-

 ing out, and nothing could have call'd him back, or turn'd the

 sword of a civil warr into the heart and bowels of the country

 but soe ill-tymed a Project as this Prov'd.

 And although it is asserted by some that at this tyme there
 was a Paper publickly read to the People that the Governor
 designed onely to raise a Partie to goe out against the Indians

 and not against Bacon offering not onely their Estates, But by a
 solemne oath to bind and confirme this Pretention to the People,

 yet this did noe feates with the People, or tooke any other im-

 pression on them, save onely that it still more confirmed that
 Bacons cause was not onely as Good as the Governors (when
 their Pretensions were now equally agt the Indians) But also that
 the commission granted him was faire and legall, seeing he pro-

 tested not to prosecute or goe against him for it.

 Bacon at this tyme was so much the hopes and Darling of the

 legatees were his wife, Elizabeth, eldest son, Richard Thorp, and

 about to marry Otho Thorp, made a deed to her sons, Richard and

 & con, a mischievous writing was drawne up and produced by
 Bacon, unto which (the doors of ye house being fast lock'd on
 them) many by threats, fforce and ffeare were feigne to subscribe.
 The tenor of the oath is as follows:

 i. You are to oppose what Forces shall be sent out of Eng-
 land by his Majesty against mee, till such tyme I have acquainted

 the King with the state of this country, and have had an answer.
 2. You shall sweare that what the Governor and councill have
 acted is illegal and destructive to the country, and what I have
 done is according to the Lawes of England.

 3. You shall sweare from your hearts that my comission is

 lawfull and legally obtained.

 4. You shall sweare to divulge what you shall heare at any

 time spoken against mee.

 5. You shall keepe my secrets, and not discover them to any

 person.

 Copyes of this oath are sent to all or most of the countyes of
 Virginia, and by the Magistrates and others of the respective
 Precincts administered to the People, which none (or very few)
 for feare or iforce durst or did refuse. To Perfect all at once,

 Dorothy (widow of Samuel Fenn), who died October 27, I675, and
 thirdly, Frances - , who, in I698, was the wife of John Annesley, gent.,
 of Westminster, England. Otho Thorpe died in I686-7, in the Parish
 of All-Hallows-the-Wall, Lonidon. His devisees were his nephew,

 to be soe basely extruded that high Trust lawfully residing in

 wth 200 men & Guns to goe to Accomack and seize the Gover-

 nour, Pretending to send him home Prisoner to his Maoie for to

 receive Tryall of his demeritts towards his Majesties subjects of

 and tymely care for the Preservation of it against the dayly In-
 cursions and Encroachments of the Native Salvages, who had
 destroy'd and laid wast the Plantations and cutt of many of ye

 ffamilyes of the English &c.

 The Comand of which charge was by Bacon comitted to one
 Carver a valient, Stout seaman and Gyles Bland (both since ex-
 ecuted) onely Mr. Bacon Putting more confidence in Carver had
 chiefly intrusted Carver on this designe by a Private Comission
 wCk Bland knew not of but supposed they had both equal Power.
 Things thus agitated Bacon reassumes his first designes of
 marching out against the Indians, Imprisoning some before hee
 went out, others hee had of a long continuance in hold, who in
 the beginning thought and try'd to divert his designes; other-
 some hee Subtly brought over to his Side and such whose liberty
 (if left behind) hee jealously suspected might raise any party ag'
 him in his absence, hee tooke along with him.

 Bacon goes up again to the Falls of James River, where hee
 b)estirs himself lustily in order to a speedy march against the In-
 dians, in prosecution of his first pretentions w h were agt Ye
 Occannechees & Susquahannocks. From the ffalls of James
 River hee marcheth over to the ffreshes of Yorke to pursue the

 Brent, they joyne together and marching to the highest Planta-

 tions seated upon Yorke River, were there detained by a day or

 two's Raine, and for fear of want of Provisions Bacon address-

 eth himself to the Army and Speakes to them after this manner:

 " That hee feared the badnesse of the weather (which was like

 to continue) would much hinder their expectations of meeting

 with the enemy soe soone as otherwise they might the weather

 being good, which would cause a second losse not to be helped

 or prevented at present which hee feared would be in the want

 of Provisions. To help which in tyme, and to lett them all

 know, for the future hee would order but allowances, soe that

 (being not far out of the reach of the settl'd Plantations) all

 those he gave full leave to returne, the heate of whose courage

 & resolutions for the Suppressing of the heathen, and revenge

 the Bloods of their ifriends and acquaintances they had shed,

 were not above and more than the particular regard and care

 they had for theire Belly. Bidding them draw forth if any such

 were, and be gone, for I am sure (said hee) where there shal be

 occasion for such a fright, I shall find them the worst of cowards,

 serving for number but not for service, and starve my best men,

 who would beare the Brunt of all, and dishearten others of half

 mettle from freely engaging &c., amongst which onely 3 wthdrew,

 soe they were disarm'd and sent in."

 The bad weather abating he proceeds on his march and in a

 short time falls into a Path of the Indians which lead to a maine

 one which made him imagine himself to be neere their main

 camp; but by the Scouts sent out for discovery, hee found noth-

 ing more yet, than a continued large Path and woods, which

 made them break the order of marching, and for expedition and

 conveniency to march at randome, soe continuing all along till

 this Path brought them to a Point, on each Side whereof and

 before it was a swamp; upon which Point the Pamunkey Indians

 had severall cabbins.

 the English, who riding downe in great disorder and hast to the

 Point (being about half a miles distance off) the Indians broke

 to the very edge of the swamp, which prov'd so mirey that

 Bacon and his men were presently at a ne plus ultra, so that the

 mighty deale that was done at this tyme was onely the taking of

 a little Indian child, and the killing an Indian woman.

 It chanced that the Queene of Pamunkey with severall of her

 Principall Indians and others was nlot far off wheni this onset

 happen'd and had notice of Bacon's approach on her Track of

 which her owne scouts had made discovery to her, who leaving

 behiind her all her goods and Indian corne vessels &c., and as
 imiuch as shee could to decline all occasion of oflending the Eng-

 lish whom she ever so much loved and reverenced, privately

 obscured from them, charging her own Indians that if they found

 the English coming upon them that they should neither ffire a

 gun nor draw an arrow upon them.

 It soe happened in the Stieffling Pursuit that they light on an

 old Indian woman that was the Queen's niurse, whom they took

 Prisoner and hoped Shee would be their Guide to find out those

 Indians that fled. But instead of directing them that way she

 led them quite contrary, Soe that following hier the remainder of

 that and almost another day, perceiving themselves mislead by

 her and little likelihood of meeting with them, Bacon gave com-

 mand to his Soldiers to knock her in the head, which they did,

 and they left her dead on the way.

 They marching after this at random (yet hoping and aimaing
 still to find themi out) at last met w1" an Indian Path against
 which led them to a main Swamp, where several niations of In-

 dians lay encamped, and striking through Straight of one of

 them fell in upoIn them, where the first that was taken was a

 young woman belonging to the Nanjaticoe Indians, half starved,
 and so not able to escape. The main of thenm fled and upon
 search made after them they discovered and killed two or three

 Indian men and as many women.

 and that he would be with them with all possible Speede:

 Now Bacon's high Pretences raised the People's hopes to the

 highest pitch and at the same time put him on a necessity of

 doing Something before he returned, which might not altogether

 fall short of his own Vaunting, but being hitherto disappointed,

 his army tyred, Murmuring, impatient, half starved, dissatisfied,

 he gives liberty to as many as would to return in with the foot

 he had ordered to march in before him, giving them two days'

 provisions to reach (if they could) the English Plantations; those

 that were dismissed being the Northern forces commanded by

 Colo. Brent. (The whole being now 400 men) with the rest he
 moves on hunting anid beating the Swamps up and down, at last
 meets with an opening of a tract upon high land, which he fol-

 lows so long that almost all his Provisions were spent, and forced

 to come to quarter allowances, and having led them far into the

 woods he makes a short halt & speaks thus to them:

 "Gentlemen,

 The indefatigable Paines which hitherto wee have taken

 doth require abundantly better successe than as yett wee have

 mett with. But there is nothing soe hard, but by Labour and
 Industry it may bee overcome, which makes me niot without
 hope of obtaining my desires against the heathen in meeting

 with them to quit Scores for all their Barbarous crueltyes done

 us.

 I had rather my carcase should lye rotting in the woodes, and

 never see English mans face againe in Virginia, than misse of

 doing that service the country expects from me, and I vowed to

 performe against these heathen, which should I returne not suc-

 cesfull in some manner to damnifie and affright them wee should

 have them as much animated as the English discouraged, and

 my adversaryes to insult and reflect on inee; that my Defence

 of the country is but Pretended and not Reall and (as they al-

 ready say) I have other Designs and make this but my Pretense

 and cloke. But that all shall see how devoted I am to it, con-

 sidering the great charge the country is at in fitting mee forth

 and the hopes and expectation they have in mee. All you gen-

 tlemen that intend to abide with mee must resolve to undergoe

 all the hardshipps this wilde can afforde, dangers and successes
 and if need bee to eate chinkapins and horseflesh before hee
 returns. Which resolve I have taken therefore desire none but
 those which will so freely adventure, the other to Returne in,
 and for the better knowledge of them I will separate my campe
 some distance from them bound home."

 Which done, and the next morning by an hour & half of the
 sun, the one marching on towards the Plantation, and the other

 on the Indian designe. They were not three hours seperated
 before the Rebell Bacon falls upon the Pamunkey Indians, who
 lay incamped beyond a small branch of a swamp or Run of
 water, having a swamp on the right hand, and a small swamp or
 run on the left of them, betweene which was a ffine piece of
 champion land, but full of thickett, small oke, saplings, chinka-
 pin Bushes and Grape vines, which the Indians made their cov-
 ert. As the onsett was given they did not at all oppose, but fled,
 being followed by Bacon and his Forces killing and taking them
 Prisoners, and looking for the Plunder of the ffield which was
 Indian matts, Basketts, matchcotes, parcells of wampampeay
 and Roanoke (woh is their money) in Baggs, skins, ffurrs, Pieces
 of Lynnen, Broad cloth, and divers sorts of English goods (web
 the Queene had much value for),* 45 captives which upon sound
 of Trumpett was brought together and delivered in by order of
 Bacon; the Plunder and captives estimated noe lesse worth than
 6 or 700, the Goodes being 3 horse loades.

 The good Queen of Pamunky during this attaque to save her

 Life betooke herselfe to flight with onely one little Indian Boy
 of about io yeares old along with her, and when she was once
 coming back with designe to throw herself upon the mercy of
 the English, Shee happened to meet with a deade Indian woman
 lying in the way being one of her own nation; which struck such
 terror in the Queene that fearing their cruelty by that gastly
 example shee went on her first intended way into wild woodes
 where shee was lost and missing from her owne People ffourteen
 dayes, all that tyme being Sustained alive onely by gnawing

 *The Indian Prisoners were some of them sold by Bacon & the rest
 disposed of by Sr. Wm. Berkeley, all but five w'ch were restored to the
 Queen by Ingram who was Bacon's Gen'll. (Marginal note in original.)

 sometimes upon the legg of a terrapin, which the little Boy

 found in the woods and brought her when she was ready to dye

 for want of ffoode, and of a great while had not Provisions for

 her support but noe necessity could incline her to adhere to

 Bacon's overtures. While Bacon continued out upon this Indian

 Enterprize the Governour had the good fortune to retake Larri-

 more's Shipp from the Rebells with which they designed to seize

 the Governor and carry him home Prisoner to England; the

 manner of this reprisal was thus:

 Carver with a party of men being gone on shore to treat with

 the Governor at Accomack, before wc' Larrimore's ship lay,

 (the comand whereof Carver had usurped) and leaving onely

 Bland on board with a number of men to wob the seamen of the

 shipp were not inferior. Larrimore Sends a Letter to the Gov-

 ernour, to acquaint him how things stood on Board, and that if

 hee could send him off a party of Gentlemen in Boates hee

 would enter them all at the Gun room Ports, where having al-

 ready secur'd the Enemyes armes, hee doubted not but to sur-

 prize the men and retake the shipp.

 The Governor privately ordered off a party of his owne under

 the command of Col. Philip Ludwell while he capitulated with

 Carver in dilatory manner to give his owne party tyme to get on

 Board, which they did, all things succeeding answerable to the

 design, Bland being taken together with the rest of the Rebells;

 soone after Carver parting with the Governor rowes on Board,

 thev permitt the Boat to come so neere as that they might ffire

 directly downe upon her, and soe they also comanded Carver on

 Board & secur'd him. When hee saw this surprize hee storm'd,

 tore his haire off and curst, and exclaim'd at the cowardice of

 Bland that had betray'd and lost all their designes.

 The Governor having regain'd this ship goes on Board and in

 company with the ship Adam & Eve Capt. Gardner Comander

 i6 or 17 Sloopes and about 6oo men in armes goes up to James

 Towne, which hee ifortifies as well as he could and again Pro-

 clames Bacon and his Party Rebells and Traytors, threatening

 them with the utmost severityes of Law.

 Upon this Bacon calls his few men together which upon a

 muster made a little after the last skirmish with the Indians

 (with Baggatiers and all) were but I36 tyr'd men, and told them

 how the Governor intended to proceed against him and them.

 But this rather animated and provoked new courage in them

 than any wise daunted them, soe that among other cheerfull

 expressions they cry'd out they would stand by him their Gen-

 erall to the last.

 The hearing such hearty expressions from tyred soldiers who

 embraced his service and refused the Plunder hee now offer'd

 them, was highly pleased and said to them:

 Gentlemeni and Fellow Soldiers. How am I transported with

 gladnesse to find yotu thus unanimous, Bold and daring, brave

 and Gallant; you have the victory before you fight, the conquest

 before battle. I know you cap and dare ffight, while they will

 lye in their Place of Refuge and dare not soe much as appeare

 in the ffield before you: your hardynesse shall invite all the coun-

 try along as wee march to come in and second you.

 The Indians wee beare along with us shal be as soe many

 motives to cause Reliefe from every hand to be brought to you.

 The Ignomy of their actions cannot but soe reflect upon their

 spirits, as they will have noe courage left to fight you. I know

 you have the Prayers and wellwishes of all the People in Vir-

 ginia, while the other are loaded with their curses.

 Bacon in most incens'd manner Threathens to be revenged on

 the Governor and his party, swearing his soldiers to give noe

 quarter and professing to scorne to take any themselves, and soe

 in great fury marches oni towards James Towne, onely halting

 a while about New Kent to gain some ffresh Forces, and send-

 ing to the upper parts of James River for what they could assist

 him with.

 Having increased his number to about 300 in all, hee proceeds

 directly to Towne, as hee marcheth the People on the high

 wayes coming forth Praying for his happiness and railing agt the

 Governour and his party, and seeing the Indian captives which

 they led along as in a shew of Tryumph, gave him many thankes

 for his care & endeavours for their Preservation, bringing him

 forth Fruits and Victualls for his Soldiers, the women telling

 him if hee wanted assistance they would come themselves after

 -him.

 Intelligence coming to Bacon that the Governour had good in

 Towne a iooo men well arm'd & resolute I shall see that saith

 hee for I am now going to try them. Being told that there was

 a party of Horse of the Governors of abt. 6o Scouting out to

 observe his motion, hee smilingly answer'd hee feared them not

 coming soe neere him as to know how he did. But hee not too

 heedlesse of all reports nor in him Selfe to sure of their coward-

 ice, drawes up his men in Green Spring Old ffields, hee tells

 them that if ever they will fight they will doe it now, before

 (saith hee) I march up to their workes, having all the advantages

 of ground, places retreats, their men fresh & unwearied and

 what not advantages (Saith Bacon) to us soe few weake and

 Tyr'd.

 But I speake not this to discourage you, but to acquaint you

 (as you shall finde) what advantages they will neglect and loose,

 which (sayes he) if they had the courage to maintain that which

 they declare against us as Rebells, Traytors, &c., their allegi-

 ance would be but faintly Defended to lett us take that which

 they might command; come on my hearts of gold, hee that dyes

 in the field lyes in the Bedd of honour.*

 In the evening Bacon with his Small tyr'd Body of men, his

 fforlorne marching some distance before, comes into Paspahayes

 old ffields and advancing on horseback himselfe on the Sandy

 Beech before the Towne comands the Trumpet to sound, Fires

 his carbyne, dismounts, surveys the Ground and orders a French

 worke to be cast up.

 All this night is spent in falling of Trees, Cutting of Bushes

 and throwing up Earth, that by the help of the moone light they

 had made their French before day, although they had but two

 axes and 2 spades in all to performe this work with.

 About day-break next morning six of Bacons Soldiers ran up

 to the Pallasadees of the Towne and ffired briskly upon the

 Guard, retreating Safely without any damage at first (as is re-

 ported) the Governor gave Comand that not a Gun should be

 be loath to spill bloode and much more to be Beginner of it,

 Supposing the Rebells would hardly be soe audacious as to fire

 a gun against him, But that Bacon would rather have sent to

 him and sought his Reconciliation soe that some way or other

 might have bin found out for the Preventing of a Warr, to which

 the Governour is said to have shewne some Inclination upon the

 account of the service Bacon had performed (as he heard) against

 the Indian Enemy, and that he had brought severall Indian Pris-

 oners along with him, and especially for that there were severall

 Ignorant People which were deluded and drawne into Bacon's

 Party and thought of noe other designe than the Indian Warr

 onely, and so knew not what they did.

 But Bacon (pretending distrust of the Governior) was soe farr

 from all thought of a Treaty that hee animates his men against

 it, telling them that hee knew that party to be as Perfidious as

 cowardly, and that there was noe trust to be reposed in such,

 who thinke it noe Treachery by any wayes to Suppresse them,

 and for his tendernesse of Shedding Blood which the Governor

 pretends, & preventing a warr, sayes Bacon there are some here

 that know it to be no longer since than last weeke that hee him-

 self comanded to be Fired against us by Boats which the Gover-

 nor sent up & downe to places where the country's Provisions

 were kept for mainteinance of the Indian Warr, to fetch them

 away to support a warr amongst ourselves, and wounded sonle

 of us (which was done by Sorrell) which were against the de-

 signe of converting these stores to soe contrary a use and inten-

 tion of what they were raised for by the People. Bacon moving

 downe towards the Towne and the Shipps being brought before

 the Sandy Beach the better to annoy the enemy in case of any

 attempt of theirs to storme the Palassadoes, upon a signall given

 from ye Towne the Shipps fire their Great Gunns, and at the

 same tyme they let fly their Small-shot from the Palassadoes.

 But that small sconce that Bacon had caused to be made in the
 niight of Trees, Bush and Earth (under wob they lay) soe defended
 them that the shott did them noe damage at all, and was return'd

 back as fast from this little Fortresse. In the heat of this Firing
 Bacon commands a party of his men to make every one his Fag-

 gott and put it before his Breast and come and lay them in order

 on top of the Trench on the outside and at the end to enlarge

 and make good the Fortification, which they did, and orders

 more spades to be gott, to helpe to make it yet more defensible,

 and the better to observe their motion ordered a constant senti-

 nel in the daytime on top of a Brick Chimney* (hard by) to dis-

 cover from thence how the men in Towne mounted and dis-

 mounted, Posted and reposted, drew on and off, what number

 they were, and how they moved. Hitherto their happen'd noe

 other action, than onely Firing great and small Shott at dis-

 tances.

 But by their movings and drawings up about Towne, Bacon

 understood they intended a Sally and accordingly prepares to

 receive them, draw up his men to the most advantageous places

 he could, and now expected them (but they observ'd to draw

 off againe for some tyme) and was resolved to enter the Towne

 wth them, as they retreated, as Bacon expected and foretold they

 would do. In this Posture of expectation Bacon's fforces con-

 tinued for a hour till the watchman gave notice that they were

 drawne off againe in Towne, soe upon this Bacon's fforces did

 soe too. Noe sooner were they all on the Rebells Side gone off

 and squandered but all on a sudden a Sally is made by the Gov-

 ernor's Party, yett in this great hurry and disorder on t'other

 side they soe received them as that they forced them to retreat

 in as much confusion as they found them, to the shame of their

 braging Pretences of valour, courage and Resolution at their

 undertaking this attacque and of the cause they defended who

 yet call themselves the Loyall party, and yet dessert the Gover-

 nour, and now begin to importune him to quit ye Towne. But

 wee cannot give a better account, nor yet a truer (soe far as wee

 are informed) of this action than what this Letter of Bacon's

 relates:

 From the Camp at Sandy Beach,

 Sber the 17th, I676.

 Capt. Wm. Cookson & Capt. Edwd Skewon:

 Before wee drew up to James Towne a party of theirs flied

 before us with all hast for ffeare: with a small party of horse

 (being darke in the Evening) wee rode up to the Point at Sandy

 Beach, and sounded a Defiance which they answered, after which

 with sonie difficulty for want of materialls we entrenched our-

 selves for that night, our men with a great deal of Bravery ran

 up to their works and ffir'd Briskly and retreated without any

 losse.

 The next morning our men without the workes gave them

 some Braves and contempts to try their mettle, upon wch they

 ffir'd their great guns with Small shott to cleere their workes,

 but our men Recovered the workes, and wee are now entrenched

 very secure both from the Shipps and Towne. Yesterday they

 made a Sally with horse and ffoote in the Van, the Forlorne

 being made up of stuch men as they had compell'd to serve;

 they came up with a niarrow ffront, and pressing very close upon

 one anothers shoulders that the Forlorne might be their shelter;

 our men received them soe warmly that they retired in great dis-

 order, throwing downe theire armes, left upon the Bay, as also

 their Drum and dead men, two of which our men brought into

 our Trenches and Buried with severall of their armes. This day

 wee shewed them our Indian captives upon the workes, the Peo-

 ple come in from all parts most bravely, and wee are Infornmed
 that great multitudes of men are up for us in the Isle of Wight
 and Nancymond, and onely expect orders, as also all the South
 side of the River over against us in great nuimbers. They shew

 themselves such Pitifull cowards, contemptable as you would

 admire them. It is said that Hubert Farrell * is shot in the Belly,

 Hartwell t in the Legg, Smith in the head, Mathewes with others,

 sons of Julian Allan, deceased. In March, I675, Captain Hubert Far-

 yet as yet wee have noe certaine account. They tooke a sol-

 emne oath when they Sallyed out either to Rout us, or never

 Returne; But you know how they use to keepe them: I believe

 the Shipps are weary of their Bargaine finding their shotts all

 inconsiderable. This is our present Intelligence; be sure to take

 care of the Upper Parts against the Pyrats, and bid the men be

 courageous for that all the country is bravely Resolute.

 I had almost forgot to tell you that Chamberlaine out of a

 Bravado came with a Sloope, and lay under our workes, and

 with abundance of vaunting & railing Expressions, Threatned

 great things, but finding it too warme was feigne to take his

 Boate and leave his Sloope; Wee guesse hee was wounded by

 his ceasing to Baule (being much jeer'd by our men) which you

 know hee is not us'd to doe.

 Be sure you encourage the Soldiers in the Upper Parts and

 lett them know what a Pitifull Enemy wee have to deale with.

 they are much affraid off as I am informed. This is the most of

 After this succeslesse Sally the courages and numbers of the

 Governor's party abated much, and Bacons men thereby became

 the " grievances " sent by counties to the English commissioners. He

 was brother of Henry Hartwell, member of the Council, was justice of

 James City county ,68o, I687, and captain of militia i68o. It appears

 from the records of York county that he married, in or before I675, the

 widow of Mr. Richard Barnes. They had issue (see will of Henry

 Hartwell, of the Council): I. William, eldest son, left an onily child,

 Mary, who married, September 24, 1719, William Macon, of New Kent

 county; II. Henry, d. s. p.; III. John, married , and died in 1714;
 IV. Mary, married - Marrable, doubtless George Marrable, who

 was a Burgess for James City county in I702. John Hartwell's will was

 dated February 9, 1713, and proved in Surry May I9, 1714. Legatees:

 wife, daughter Elizabeth, mother Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Benjamin Eg-
 gleston, friend Mr. Benjamin Howard, cousin John Drummond, George

 Marrable, Jr., and William Hartwell Marrable, sons of his sister, Mary

 Marrable.

 more bold and daring in soe much that Bacon could Scarce

 keepe them from immediately falling to storme and enter the

 Towne; but hee (being as wary as they rash) perswaded them

 from the attempt, Bidding them keepe their courages untill such

 tyme as hee found occasion and opportunity to make use of

 them, telling them that hee doubted not to take the Towne with-

 out losse of a man, and that one of their Lives was of more

 value to him than the whole world.

 Having planted his great Guns, hee takes the wives and female

 Relations of such Gentlemen as were in the Governor's Service

 against him (whome hee had caused to be brought to the workes)

 and Places them in the Face of his Enemy, as Bulworkes for

 their Battery, by which Policy hee promised himself (and doubt-

 lesse had) a goode advantage, yet had the Governors party by

 much the odds in number besides the advantage of tyme and

 Place.

 But soe great was the Cowardize and Basenesse of the Gen-

 erality of Sr. William Berkeley's Party (being most of them

 men intent onely upon plunder or compell'd and hired into his

 service) that of all, at last there were onely some 20 Gentlemen

 willing to stand by him, the rest (whome the hopes or promise

 of Plunder brought thither) being now all in hast to be gone to

 secure what they had gott; soe that Sr. Wm. Berkeley himselfe

 who undoubtedly would rather have dyed on the place than thus

 deserted it, what with importunate and resistlesse Solicitations

 of all, was at last over persuaded, nay hurryed away against his

 owne Will to Accomack and forced to leave the Towne to the

 mercy of the enemy.

 Soe ifearfull of Discovery they are, that for secrecy they im-

 barque and weigh anchor in the night and silently fall downe the

 River, thus flying from the fface of an enemy that during this

 siege (which lasted one whole weeke) lay exposed to much more

 hardships, want and inaccommodation than themselves, besides

 the fatigue of a long march at their first coming to Towne, for

 this very service was supposed to be the Death of Bacon, who

 by lying in a wett Season in his Trenches before Towne con-

 tracted the Disease whereof hee not long after dyed.

 any opposition, and soldier like considering of what importance
 a Place of that Refuge was, and might againe bee to the Gov-

 ernor and his Party, instantly resolves to lay it level with the

 ground, and the same night he became poses'd of it, sett ffire

 to Towne, church and state house (wherein were the Countryes
 Records which Drummond had privately convey'd thense and

 preserved from Burning). The towne consisted of I 2 new

 brick Houses besides a considerable number of fframe houses with

 brick chimneys, all which will not be rebuilt (as is computed) for

 ffifteen hundred pounds of Tobacco.

 Now those who had so lately deserted it, as they rid a little be-
 low in the River in the Shipps and Sloopes (to their shanme and
 regret) beheld by night the Flames of the Towne, which they
 soe basely forsaking, had made a sacrifice to ruine.

 Bacon goes next to Greene Spring, and during his stay there-

 abouts draws a protest or oath against the Governor and his
 Party, which is said to be imposed on the People and taken by
 above. 6oo at once in Gloster County, and also forced upon others
 in several parts of the Country and is as follows:

 BACONS OATH OF FIDELITY.

 Whereas Sir William Berkeley Knight, late Governor of Vir-
 ginia hath in a most Barbarous and abominable manner exposed
 and betrayed our lives, and for greediness of sordid Gaine did
 defer our just defence and hinder all the Loyall endeavours of
 his Majesties faithfull subjects; and further when the Country did
 raise a sufficient fforce for the effectual proceeding against the
 Indian Enemy, he did, contrary to all Equity and Justice and

 the tenors of his commission, endeavour to oppose the said florces
 by himself -and the Assembly sett forth: of which attempts being
 severall tymes defeated by the Peoples abhorrence of soe Bloody
 a design he left the country in a small vessell, it being unknown
 to all People to what parts of the world he did repair, and whereas
 as our army upon his departure betaking themselves to the care
 of the ffrontiers did march out against the Indians and obtain soe
 great a victory, as hath in a manner finished all the disaster and
 almost Resettled the country in a happy Peace, yet notwithstand-
 ing Sir Wm. Berkeley with Forces raised in Accomack,did invade

 the said Army with these aforsaid reasons, as also having betray'd

 his Trust to the king by flying from his seate of Judicature, and

 acting wholly contrary to his comission. We protest against

 him unanimously as a Traytor and most pernitious Enemy to the

 Publick, and further we sweare that in all places of his Majestyes

 Colony of Virginia wee will oppose and prosecute him with all

 our Endeavours by all acts of hostility as occasion shall present,

 and further whereas Plotting and wishing in his heart a totall

 Ruine and Destruction of this Poore colony he hath Endeav-

 oured to set the heart of our Soveraigne against us by false In-

 formation and Lyes, requesting Forces of his Majestie wherewith

 to compell and subdue, us hindering, intercepting and preventing

 all our Remonstrances for Peace, which might have gone home

 in our justification, as also hindering of our sending home of agents

 they moved to follow them and prevent them from landing, or

 having any provisions sent on board them.

 Bacon now begins to show a more mercelesse severity and

 absolute authoity than formerly. Plundering and imprisoning

 many and condemning some by power of martial law.

 But among all made onely one exemplary (to witt) one James

 Wilkenson that had fled from his Collours, who (with one Mr.
 Clough * Minister of James Towne) was condemned to dye, but
 the first onely was executed; which (as a soldier) wee look on to
 be more an act of his Policy than cruelty, to prevent and awe
 others from disserting him, wee not observing him to have bin

 Bloodely inclined in the whole progresse of this Rebellion.

 Major West, I Bacon purposed to accept of Bland, ? Carver II and

 * Mr. John Clough was minister of Southwark Parish, Surry, in I68o.

 t See Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. III, for a

 note on Captain Thomas Hawkins, Sr. He was a vestryman of Sitting-
 bourne Parish, Rappahannock county, in I665, and a justice of Rappa-
 hannock in I670 or earlier. His will, dated February 8, I675, was
 proved in Rappahannock county November, 1677. His legatees were
 his wife, Frances, his sons, Thomas and John. He gave to his daugh-
 ter, Elizabeth, his former wife's diamond ring and pearl necklace, and
 if she died, gave them to his daughter, Hannah. There are on record
 in Essex deeds in 1659 and 1662 from Thomas Hawkins and Mary, his
 wife.

 The eldest son was doubtless the Thomas Hawkins, Jr., denounced
 by Bacon. He appears to have been in service against the Indians in
 the year after the rebellion, and to have commanded a force raised in
 several counties along the Rappahannock. There is on record in Mid-
 dlesex an order, dated October 2, I677, relating to twelve men, who, by
 order of the Governor, were sent, on February Ist, preceding, to serve
 under Major Thomas Hawkins, and who served until May. This Major
 Thomas Hawkins probably died unmarried before I696, as in that year
 and in I698 are deeds from John Hawkins, of Essex, only son and heir
 of Captain Thomas Hawkins, of Rappahannock, conveying lands pat-
 ented by the said Captain Thomas Hawkins in I662 and I666. Eliza-
 beth, wife of John Hawkins, relinguishes her dower. The will of a John
 Hawkins, dated February, 17256, was proved in Essex June, I726.
 His legatees were his sons, Thomas and William, and daughters, Mary

 ifarloe * in exchange for them, neverthelesse none of the first three

 were put to death by Bacon.

 Now Bacon finding that his Soldiers Insolences growing soe

 great and intolerable to the People (of whom they made noe due

 distinction) and finding their actings to reflect on himself, he did

 not onely betake himself to a strict Discipline over his men but

 also to more moderate courses himself.

 Releasing some Prisoners, Pardoning others that were con-

 demned, and calling those to account against whom any com-

 plaints camne for seisures or Plundering their Estates without his

 order or knowledge.

 This Prosperous Rebell, concluding now the day his owne,

 marcheth with his army into Gloster County, intending to visit

 all the northern part of Virginia to understand the state of them

 and to settle affairs after his own measures, in which (wee are in-

 formed) he proposed this method.

 and to regulate the rudenesse, disorder, spoile and waste of the

 soldiers, as they had formerly comitted.

 for affairs relating to it.

 But before he could arrive to the Perfection of his designes

 (weh none but the eye of omniscience could Penetrate) Providence

 did that which noe other hand durst (or at least did) doe and cut

 him off.

 Hee lay sick at one Mr. Pates * in Gloster County of the Bloody

 Flux, and (as Mr. Pate himself affirms) accompanyed with a

 Lousey Disease; so that the swarmes of Vermyn that bred in his

 Body he could not destroy but by throwing his shirts into the

 Fire as often as he shifted himself.

 Hee dyed much dissatisfied in minde inquiring ever and anon

 after the arrival of the Friggats & Forces from England, and

 asking if his Guards were strong about the House.

 After Bacon's Death one Joseph Ingramt a stranger in Virginia

 and came over but the year before this Rebellion, under whose

 conduct the ffaction began to fall into several parties and opin-

 ions, which gave Sr Wm. Berkely's party opportunity by these

 divisions to surprise the Rebels in small Bodyes as they sculked

 up and down the country.

 But the maine service that was done for the reducing the

 Rebells to their obedience was done by the Seamen and com-

 manders of Shipps then riding in the Rivers especially the Gen-

 erall Surrender at Wests Point of those headed by Ingram and

 Wacklute, wcb was managed and concluded by Capt. Grantham,

 to the disgust of those Gentlemen of the Governor's Party,

 because Sr Wm. Berkeley had not made them concerned in soe

 considerable a Piece of Service.

 After Ingram had submitted to the Governor (who lay then

 on Board Martyn's Ship in Yorke River), Laurance that notori-

 ous Rebell fled, who was the first man that sett fire to James

 in I670 and died in i68i, or his nephew, Thomas Pate, who was a justice

 was nephew of Richard Pate, of Gloucester, who was a member of the

 House of Burgesses in I653 and died in I657.
