TRADE AND EXCHANGE IN MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION PREHISTORY

R. Michael Stewart

Abstract

Evidence for prehistoric trade and exchange during the time from approximate-
ly 2500 B.C. until European contact in the seventeenth century A.D. is presented.
Two distinctive types of exchange can be identified: broad-based networks which
represent down-the-line exchange and web-like relationships common throughout
the region, and which are manipulated by some groups who "hoard" items within
their home territories; and focused networks which consist of individuals or small
groups from the Middle Atlantic insinuating themselves into broad-based networks
outside of the region to obtain goods which are then hoarded within their home
territories. Broad-based and focused systems develop concurrently with group ter-
ritoriality, population growth, and the cyclical use of resources. The exchange
systems serve as a conduit of information, a means of reducing potential conflict
between competing or neighboring groups, and as subsistence "insurance" or a
means of maintaining potential access to resources outside of an individual's or
group's exploitative territory. In addition, focused exchange networks are initially
linked with complex societies, which have a spotty distribution within the region
from Late Archaic through Middle Woodland times. Items gained in trade, generally
from sources outside of the region, end up in burials or other special contexts.
However, focused networks also exist outside of the context of complex societies
and burial ceremonialism, as is evident by the occurrence of many of the same
extra-regional exotics in general site deposits throughout the region. This obser-
vation suggests that focused networks are not specialized or institutionalized rela-
tions between complex societies within the Middle Atlantic region and complex
societies in other regions of the country, especially the Ohio Valley heartland of
Adena and Hopewell cultures.

Introduction

In the Middle Atlantic region, extensive exchange networks are first visible during the Late Archaic
period, or after 2500 B.C.. Prior to this time, finds of artifacts at great distances (100 miles or more) from
natural sources of their constituent materials can be noted. Expansive group territories crosscutting
physiographic zones, relatively frequent settlement movements, low population densities, and sporadic un-
patterned episodes of exchange or gift-giving are some of the factors responsible for these distributions (cf.
Griffin 1978: 226; Handsman and McNett 1974: 39; Meltzer 1987; Stewart 1984a: 20-24).

This paper provides an overview of the evidence for prehistoric trade and exchange in the Middle Atlan-
tic region from approximately 2500 B.C. until the time of concerted European contact during the early seven-
teenth century A.D. Distinctive types of exchange networks are defined and their function and relationships
in prehistoric societies are explored. Likely models for the development and nature of trade and exchange
systems are also presented. Both the types of trade defined and models of their development must be viewed
as hypotheses in need of testing.

Following Renfrew (1969: 152), trade/exchange is used in its broadest sense as the reciprocal traffic, ex-
change, or movement of material goods through peaceful human agency. Sharing, the altruistic movement
of goods (Snethkamp 1981:62), is also lumped under the rubric of exchange since it generally leads to reciprocal
obligations in hunting and gathering societies (Sahlins 1972: 205). A pan-regional study of the distribution
of rhyolite artifacts, their context, and morphology (Stewart 1984a,b) provides a basis for addressing the chang-
ing nature of exchange through time and serves as a comparative foil for examining the distribution and
context of other exotic materials and artifacts. No other region-wide syntheses have been attempted although
similar studies have been completed for large areas within the Middle Atlantic (Andrefsky 1983; Custer 1984a;

Stewart 1980, 1983; Wanser 1982; Ward and Doms 1984).

Trade and other types of group interaction are best understood after the internal and regional structure
of social, settlement, and subsistence systems have been determined (Hodder 1980:154), and the state of
research in the Middle Atlantic region satisfies these requirements to varying degrees. Much of the follow-
ing discussion is organized by period as follows: Late Archaic, 3000 B.C. to 1000 B.C. (includes what has been
referred to as the Transitional or Terminal Archaic periods); Early Woodland, 1000 B.C. to 400 B.C.; Middle
Woodland, 400 B.C. to A.D. 800; and Late Woodland, A.D. 800 to European contact. The chronological breaks
in this scheme are meant to coincide with major shifts in common adaptations and material culture, and
therefore vary depending on the geographic area and the basis employed to organize prehistoric developments
(compare Custer 1984b, Gardner 1986; Ritchie 1965). Nonetheless, dated material and sites allow for com-
parisons across the region regardless of the cultural labels used from place to place. In general, adaptations
pre-dating the Late Woodland period are elaborations on a hunting and gathering theme. Prehistoric
agriculturalists are known only from the Late Woodland period and, even then, the use of cultivated plants
is not shared to the same degree by all groups in the region.

Ideally, trade and exchange should be addressed at the level of contemporaneous phases or components
within the larger periods. This is only possible in some instances since the intensity of archeological research
is uneven for geographic zones within the Middle Atlantic region. Where radiocarbon assays or clear
stratigraphic contexts are lacking, sites and deposits have been dated by reference to diagnostic artifacts,
primarily projectile points and ceramics. While I do not subscribe to the normative view of culture implied
by this assumption, the present data base leaves little other choice. This "lumping" may actually be beneficial
in some regards since a number of projectile styles, some looked upon as fingerprints of distinctive phases
or components in the traditional literature, may in fact have been used contemporaneously during the Late
Archaic through Middle Woodland periods (cf. Bachman and Custer 1984; Custer 1982a; Custer and Mellin
1987: 69).

Background

The Middle Atlantic region is thought of as both a culture area and a universe of researchers sharing
common meetings, conferences, and publication outlets (cf. Brennan 1983; Custer 1987a: Figure 6; Flannery
1939; Kinsey 1971; Stephenson and Ferguson 1963: 200-205; Stewart 1987a; Thurman 1985). As with any
such construct, its boundaries are not hard and fast. At various points in time, southern portions of the region
are felt to have included Coastal North Carolina (Thurman 1985: 8) and South Carolina (Phelps 1983: 16).
To the north, sections of eastern and southern New York are characteristically included (Ritchie 1965: Figure
4). Western boundaries for a prehistoric culture area were initially drawn at the western edge of the Pied-
mont along the Blue Ridge or Ridge and Valley provinces (Stephenson and Ferguson 1963: Figure 30) although
research in the past decade has demonstrated the intimate link of the Coast and Piedmont with more in-
terior areas (Stewart 1987a). Discussions here will include primarily Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, and segments of New York, West Virginia, and North Carolina.

Figure 1 shows the general physiographic divisions of the region. Gardner (1987) provides examples of
the environmental diversity in each of the provinces that is of relevance to archeological studies, while detailed
treatments of the variability that exists can be found in reports too numerous to list. Besides the geologic
map coverage of the region, the distribution and quality of rock materials that would have been useful in
prehistoric technologies are discussed in a number of papers and publications (Brown n.d.; Custer and Galasso
1980; Didier 1975; Fanale 1974; French 1968; Fogelman 1983; Gardner 1987; Hammer 1976; Holland et al.
1981; LaPorta 1986; Lavin and Prothero 1981, 1987; Marshall 1982:Maps 5, 6; Michael 1963; Miller 1982;
Rutsch 1970; Stewart 1980: 143-160, 1984b; Ward and Custer 1988; Wedow and Sweeney 1968; Wilkins 1974;
Wray 1948).

Attempts at chemically or spectrographically sourcing lithic or other materials found in the region are
spotty, although necessary to fully understanding the suite of materials and artifacts that moved through
trade and exchange networks. Neutron activation, X-ray diffraction, petrographic, or other specialized analyses
have been completed for some sources ofjasper (Blackman 1974; Hatch and Miller 1985; Luedtke 1984, 1987;

Lavin 1983; Lavin and Prothero 1981; Miller 1982), cherts (Didier 1974; Kuhn and Lanford 1987; LaPorta
1986; Lavin 1983; Lavin and Prothero 1981, 1987), argillites (McCann 1972: 18, 20), rhyolites (Ayers 1972;
Clark 1977; Fauth 1978; Stose and Stose 1946), and soapstone, talc, or chlorite (Holland et al. 1981; Lucken-
bach, Allen, and Holland 1975; Luckenbach, Holland, and Allen 1975; Stose and Stose 1946; Turnbaugh
1979). There have been even fewer attempts to confirm the sources of copper artifacts from sites in the region
(MacCord 1973; MacCord and Buchanan 1980: 118; Williams et al. 1981). Some attempts have been made
to trace, through physical analyses, the origins of clays and ceramics which may have been gained in trade
(cf. Kuhn 1987; Mouer n.d.). Table 1 lists materials that are currently recognized as exchanged goods within
the Middle Atlantic region. Many of the materials have sources both within and outside of the region and
thus it is difficult to be sure, without physical sourcing, where certain items may have originated. Assigning
jaspers and cherts to specific sources solely on the basis of macroscopic features is especially risky (cf. Gard-
ner 1984; Hammer 1976: 54). Multi-colored cryptocrystalline materials, in the form of primary and secon-
dary deposits, are widely distributed in portions of the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, Ridge and Valley, and Plateau
provinces. Further, the geologic mapping of many areas rarely considers the occurrence of cherts and jaspers,
although archeologists working with models of how these materials form have located substantial deposits
(cf.Fanale 1974; Stewart 1980: 143-160). Jasper is included in Table 1 since sourcing studies have demonstrated
its movement between regions (Luedtke 1984, 1987). Midwestern flints, cherts, and chalcedony on Middle
Atlantic sites have only rarely been confirmed through sourcing analysis (cf. Didier 1974) although these
materials are assumed to be represented at a number of localities.

In some cases, "eyeballing" an artifact is reasonable since a number of materials have unique natural
sources and exhibit distinctive macroscopic features, such as rhyolite, argillite, and ironstone. Rhyolites are
found in a small section of the Blue Ridge province in Pennsylvania and Maryland, with another distinctive
and much less used variety noted in extreme southwestern Virginia (Stewart 1984b: 5). Argillites are also
limited to relatively well-documented formations in portions of the Delaware and Hudson Valleys (Didier
1975). Ironstone is widely distributed in small patches throughout Coastal Plain areas and intensively used,
high quality sources have been documented as part of very localized exchange systems (Ward and Doms 1984).
Soapstone, talc, or chlorite occurs throughout the region in a belt crosscutting the Piedmont physiographic
province, and extends both to the south and north of the Middle Atlantic (Brown n.d.; Cross 1956: 194; Holland
et al. 1981; Turnbaugh 1979: Figure 1; Ward and Custer 1988). Minor sources, including materials that can
be used like soapstone, such as sericite schists and sericite phyllites, can also be found in more interior areas
of the region including the Highlands of New Jersey (Richards 1941: 22), the Ridge and Valley of Pennsylvania
(French 1968: Table 113), the Appalachian Plateau of Pennsylvania (Lantz et al. 1982), and sections of the
Blue Ridge province in Pennsylvania (Fauth 1968: 13; Oles 1967; Stose 1932: 28-30; Wedow and Sweeney
1968: 360) and Maryland (Edwards 1978; Godfrey 1975:1; Stewart 1980: 159-160). It is likely that similar
sources could be located in Virginia and West Virginia.

Slates suitable for the manufacturing of ornaments and bannerstones are found in portions of Pennsylvania
and West Virginia (Newman et al. 1968: 204-205) although the use of specific sources by Native Americans
has not been demonstrated. Major slate concentrations are found outside of the region in a narrow belt within
the Ridge and Valley province from Tennessee through Georgia and into central Alabama (Newman et al.
1968: 204).

Much of the fire clay or flint clay used for tubular and blocked end pipes recognized as trade items has
been ascribed to Ohio sources (cf. Ritchie 1965:201). However, there are sources of such clays within the Mid-
dle Atlantic region in portions of western Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and West Virginia (Hosterman
et al. 1968: 175-177; Mayer-Oakes 1955: 60). While it is assumed that flint clay native to the Allegheny River
valley of Pennsylvania was exploited during prehistoric times, sources in other areas of the Middle Atlantic
have not been examined for signs of aboriginal use.

Mica is another material with sources both within and outside of the region that could have been ex-
ploited by prehistoric peoples. Scrap mica can be found throughout much of the Piedmont in the Middle Atlantic
region. Major occurrences of sheet mica are in the pegmatites of western North Carolina and Piedmont/Blue
Ridge sections of Virginia (French 1968:Table 113; Leasure and Shirley 1968: 314). Most known aboriginal
mines of mica correspond with localities in North Carolina that were also mined in historic times and con-
tinue to be worked (Chapman and Keel 1979: 161; Leasure and Shirley 1968: 317-318). French (1968:Table

that has never been investigated for signs of prehistoric use.

Minor amounts of native copper occur in northeastern New Jersey (Williams et al. 1981: 9; Williams
and Thomas 1982: Figure 4), and Blue Ridge sections of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia (French 1968:
Table 113; Kinkel et al. 1968:379, 384, Figure 98). MacCord and Buchanan (1980: 118) have shown that at
least some of the Virginia sources were used by prehistoric peoples. Major sources of workable copper are
found in the Ducktown District of North Carolina and Tennessee (French 1968: Table 113; Goad 1979: 241;
Goodman 1984: 7; Kinkel et al. 1968: 377). There are also the well known deposits in the Great Lakes region
of Michigan and Wisconsin (cf. Schroeder and Ruhl 1968).

Present natural distributions of Marginella are found from the Chesapeake Bay south to the Florida Coast
(Morris 1973). Species of Busycon, Oliva, and Olivella are found along the Virginia/North Carolina Capes
south to Florida (Gosner 1979: 133-134; MacCord and Buchanan 1980: 116; Valliere and MacCord 1986: 58).
Sharks teeth occur in fossil deposits along portions of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and in some coastal
areas of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida (Ransom 1964: 181, 189, 233, 284,
307, 331).

VOLUME 17, 1989

Other miscellaneous items from within the region that appear to have been traded include: galena from
the Great Lakes region of New York (Ritchie 1959: 47), Plateau and Ridge and Valley sections of Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and Virginia (French 1968: Table 113); pyrites and quartz crystals from the Appalachian sections
of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina (French 1968: Table 113); and petrified wood from
Coastal New Jersey (Mounier 1974: 25), and the Ridge and Valley of Pennsylvania and Maryland (French
1968: Tkble 113).

The rare obsidian artifacts found in the Middle Atlantic region are felt to have originated in the western
United States (cf. Fogelman 1983: 14; Kraft and Cavallo 1974; McCary 1968). A rare find of a jade artifact
presumed to be derived from a Mesoamerican source has also been reported (Thomas 1972: 12). Catlinite,
which appears with some frequency in late prehistoric contexts in the region, has been traced to sources
in Wisconsin and Minnesota (Kuhn 1987: 305).

In summary, there are a number of distinctive materials that can be traced through the region in study-
ing the extent and nature of prehistoric exchange. It is necessary to assume, for the sake of argument, that
assessments of the origins of some materials are reliable in the absence of confirmation through physical
analyses. Alternate natural sources are evaluated where possible. It is likely that materials others than those
listed were traded in the region and some of these will no doubt become visible as sourcing research pro-
gresses. Foodstuffs and artifacts fashioned from organic materials are poorly preserved in the archeological
record of the region, their absence serving to remind us that we are seeing only a part of the whole picture.

Late Archaic

Discussion

Broad-based exchange
Items that appear to be traded during Late Archaic times include artifacts made from jasper, argillite,
rhyolite, ironstone, soapstone, midwestern lithics, obsidian, marine shell, and copper. The frequency distribu-
tions of rhyolite, argillite, ironstone, and jasper artifacts in the region describe basic patterns that also
characterize much of the trade that occurs throughout remaining prehistoric times. In the first pattern (Figure
2a), the percentage of a given material exhibits a gradual falloff pattern within 30 to 50 miles of a source
followed by dramatic declines in frequencies, although artifacts may continue to be found from 200 to 300
miles from a source (Custer 1984c: 41; Stewart 1980: Table 17, Figure 38; 1984a: Table 5, Figure 5). However,
the falloff patterns on the more distant ends of artifact distributions are not always a symmetric monotonic
decrease as defined by Renfrew (1977: 71-74). I refer to the above patterns as broad-based exchange although
the label low level exchange has been applied to the same phenomena elsewhere (Custer 1984b: 62). The
final section of this paper reconciles previous definitions and terms with the views expressed here.

Rhyolite artifacts are found as distant as northwestern and eastern New York, the Appalachian Plateau
of Pennsylvania, mid-sections of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and coastal New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, and Virginia (Stewart 1984a: Figures 2, 5). Artifacts of Delaware and/or Hudson Valley argillites
extend into central New York (Ritchie 1965: 102, 138, 152), the West Branch of the Susquehanna River in
Pennsylvania (cf. Turnbaugh 1977:262) and to portions of southern Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula
(cf.Custer 1984a; Wanser 1982: Table 8.1). Jaspers, presumably from eastern Pennsylvania, have been recogniz-
ed in eastern and central New York (Funk 1976; Ritchie 1965: 102, 138, 152). However, Hammer (1976: 54)
cautions against labelling all reddish or brown cryptocrystalline material found on New York sites as Penn-
sylvania jasper since there are substantial outcrops of red-brown cherts in eastern New York which need
to be considered. Ironstone artifact distributions are restricted to northern sections of the Chesapeake Bay
and the Upper Delmarva Peninsula (Ward and Doms 1984).

The noted distributions are a fingerprint of both the distinctive territories of groups or bands who can
procure a material directly, and down-the-line exchange of tools and implements of these same materials
(see Figure 2a). Traded items are most frequently in the form of finished projectile points and bifaces which
are used as utilitarian objects, resharpened, and eventually discarded in general contexts at sites. These goods
are rarely found in specialized contexts such as burials (cf. Ritchie 1965: 138). Caches of middle and early
stage bifaces are also widespread but do not occur with nearly the same frequency. It is my impression that
traded items occur on all functional types of sites although this needs to be documented. Custer (1984b: 99)

indicates that in Delaware, nonlocal lithic materials show up most often at macro-band base camps.

The initiation of widespread, broadly-based, down-the-line trade and exchange is credited by most resear-
chers to the Late Archaic period generally, and more specifically to the period post-dating 2500/2000 B.C.
and deposits associated with the Frontenac and Brewerton phases defined for New York, and a variety of
phases and complexes associated with broad-bladed or broadspear and fishtail projectile/biface types and
often grouped under the rubric of the Transitional or Terminal Late Archaic (Ritchie 1965: 102, 116, 118,
123, 138, 152; Snethkamp 1981: 61,74; Stewart 1984a; Wanser 1982: 194). The longevity of these artifact
styles and associated radiocarbon dates suggest that the exchange networks continue unabated throughout
remaining Late Archaic times. In contrast, Andrefsky's (1983: 216, 219) study of projectile point styles and
material types in the Upper Delaware Valley concludes that the intensity of trade in this area decreases
through the period. Custer (1984b: 98-99) implies that the same extensive networks are in operation by 3000
B.C. and persist until 500 B.C. as evidenced by the Clyde Farm and Barker's Landing complexes in Delaware.
What seems obvious from these data is that trade networks are in fact extensive and not restricted to
formalized relations between a limited number of groups. What, when, and how much is exchanged seems
to depend on the particular needs or motivations of the parties involved and is not dictated by the nature
of the exchange system itself. The exchange is not strictly directional (Renfrew 1977: 85) in that goods at
a material's source do not seem to be produced specifically for trade with a distant but well defined area,
group, or trading partner.

Hoarding
The second pattern of exchange, first seen during the Late Archaic (see Figure 2b) and evident in the
intra-regional movement of rhyolite, argillite, ironstone, and perhaps jasper, seems to be a manipulation of
the broad-based, down-the-line systems. As is most clear in the distribution of rhyolite and argillite, there
are territories or areas well removed from sources of these material that show unusually high percentages
of traded artifacts with respect to the expectations of down-the-line exchange and monotonic decrement. What
is desired is gained through the broad-based systems and these goods are "hoarded" (Hodder 1980: 152) within
specific social or political territories and removed from further exchange within the broad-based systems.
In graphic form (see Figure 2), these distributions superficially resemble directional trade as defined by Ren-
frew (1977: 85-87).

For example, at the Frontenac Island site south of Lake Ontario in New York and over 200 miles from
source areas, Ritchie (1965: 162) excavated a cache of "killed" rhyolite blades from a grave associated with
a Susquehanna Broadspear/Frost Island component. In the lower Genesee Valley of New York, also south
of Lake Ontario, up to 42 percent of Susquehanna Broadspears on a site may be fashioned from rhyolite
(Trubowitz and Snethkamp 1975: 22-23), whereas areas at similar distances from rhyolite sources have
assemblages with less than five percent of the material (Stewart 1984a: 30, Figure 5). Probably the most
dramatic and well-documented examples of this phenomena are from the Upper Delmarva Peninsula of
Delaware where percentages of rhyolite and argillite, rivalling what is found on sites adjacent to sources,
can be noted as part of the Barker's Landing Complex on the St. Jones and Murderkill drainages (Custer
1982b: 32; 1984a; 1984b: 99). In southern Maryland, greater proportions of rhyolite and argillite are
documented for the Patuxent drainage than for comparable sections of the nearby Potomac Valley (Wanser
1982: 194).

The type of artifacts involved in hoarding and their intra-site contexts varies. In all areas identified, finish-
ed artifacts appear to have been traded as well as early and middle stage bifaces. The finished artifacts are
used, resharpened, and usually discarded in general contexts. Early and middle stage bifaces receive a varie-
ty of treatments. They may be placed, without any further reduction, into specialized contexts such as caches
or graves, or they may exhibit the use history of any biface gradually reduced in the service of a variety
of tasks, eventually ending up in the general deposits of a site. As with the first pattern of exchange describ-
ed, it is difficult to tell if hoarded goods are differentially distributed by site type. Again, Custer (1984b:
99) indicates that in the Upper Delmarva, artifacts gained through exchange are most concentrated at macro-
band base camps.

Evidence of hoarding is tied to burial ceremonialism and complex societies in some areas, especially the
Upper Delmarva Peninsula (Custer 1984b), but is not solely linked to such developments throughout the


55

region, contrary to some earlier assessments (Ford 1974: 394; Griffin 1978: 231). In some instances, such
as the Delmarva-northern Delaware example, hoarded materials may have been part of a status system and
social ranking (Custer 1984a, b), traits that are not common to most Middle Atlantic cultures at this time.
Exchanged products may also have served as low level indicators of status in other areas in the region (Rit-
chie 1965: 120) where items appear to be hoarded, but the evidence for their role in developing complex societies
is far from clear.

Directional trade is rejected as an alternative explanation to hoarding since it implies the existence and
formal linkage of central places or gateway communities which serve as the locus of exchange activities,
or the involvement of groups or families who have preferential access to goods (Hirth 1978: 37-38; Renfrew
1977: 85-86). No such sites or communities have been identified, even near sources of material where produc-
tion of trade goods would have had to have been managed for directional trade with distant consumers. The
documented volume and distribution of traded artifacts throughout the region argues against the existence
of groups with preferential access to specific sources of material or production centers. The geographic ex-
tent of rhyolite, argillite, ironstone, and jasper sources would have precluded the control of any of these resources
by a particular group.

For the production end of exchange networks, the most detailed data are available for rhyolite. The Late
Archaic use of quarry and quarry-related workshops and sites is consistently intensive, especially when com-
pared with earlier times, and emphasizes the production of regularized tool forms, bifacial blanks, and flake
cores (Stewart 1987b: 54). Ericson (1984: 6) views this type of production activity as a craftsman's response
to anonymous consumers, or consumers with highly variable needs, a perspective that fits well with rhyolite's
role in down-the-line types of exchange. It is very likely that argillite, and possibly jasper, quarry and quarry-
related sites show similar patterning for the same period (cf. Hatch and Miller 1985). In no case is there
evidence for full-time craft specialization although the existence of part-time specialists can be postulated
(Stewart 1987b: 54).

For the period as a whole, rhyolite outstrips other materials in terms of the quantity and distances that
artifacts are moved. The greatest flow of exchanged rhyolite artifacts seems to be to the north, east, and
southeast of source areas. For argillite the pattern is somewhat similar suggesting concerted interactions
with areas to the north, east, and south. Ironstone artifacts generally describe a north to south distribution.
It is not possible to accurately characterize trade in jasper given the wide distribution of potential natural
sources and the spotty nature of sourcing studies.

Soapstone artifacts, primarily in the form of large bowls, are literally everywhere and obviously were
traded throughout the region and into the Ohio Valley, Midwest, and Great Lakes region (Dragoo 1976: 15;
Holland et al. 1981: 201-202, Table 1, Figure III; Inghram 1953: 46; Mayer-Oakes 1955: 53, Plates 12, 13;
Spence and Fox 1986: 5). Although Middle Atlantic soapstone shows up on midwestern sites (Holland et al.
1981: Table 1, Figure III), it does not appear with any frequency to the north or south of the region. Soapstone
originating in Connecticut and Rhode Island appears within the region but material from Massachusetts,
Vermont, and Maine is rare (Holland et al. 1981: 201).

In the absence of a quantified regional study, it is my impression that soapstone artifacts reveal the same
dual patterning described for rhyolite, argillite, jasper, and ironstone: gradual falloff from sources indicative
of down-the-line, broad-based exchange; and concentrations of traded goods in well-defined territories resulting
from the hoarding of materials gained through the broad-based networks. While the existence of the first
pattern is a logical assumption (see also Witthoft 1971: 177), it has been shown that soapstone on a site
need not be from the nearest source of that material (Luckenbach, Allen, and Holland 1975; Mouer et al.
1981: 41). Evidence of the hoarding of soapstone artifacts is provided by Custer's (1984a: Figure 15) Delmar-
va study.

Since Witthoft's (1953) original observation, studies have continued to note the primary distribution of
soapstone bowls on sites along major drainages, both within and outside of the region (cf. Funk 1976: 266;
Snow 1980: 240). This distribution is felt to relate to the use of water transportation and the difficulties
inherent in moving about with large stone bowls, and not a consequence of trade patterns. Soapstone bowls
are usually found in general contexts on sites but are a common element in Orient graves in New York (Rit-
chie 1959: 62) during the waning years of the Late Archaic and early segments of the Early Woodland period.

Focused exchange
The distribution of midwestern and other extra-regional lithics, including obsidian, is patchy at best dur-
ing the Late Archaic with materials used for utilitarian projectile points and bifaces found in general site
contexts, primarily in northern and western portions of the region, and less frequently in more eastern and
southern zones (cf. Dumont et al. 1974: 17; Eisert 1981: 28; Funk 1976: 259). Some bifaces and projectiles
occur as grave goods in cremation burials in coastal New Jersey, which have been radiocarbon dated between
2300 B.C. and 1900 B.C. (Didier 1974; Mounier 1982: 82-83; Regensburg 1971, n.d.). In southeastern Virginia,
there are scattered reports of caches and unusual distributions of Perkiomen Broadspears, many made on
jaspers and other materials considered to be exotic to the area (McAvoy 1986; McCary 1972; Daniel Mouer,
1988 personal communication).

Oyster and marine shell pendants are attributed to the Frontenac phase in central New York, 2500 B.C.
to 2000 B.C., and appear primarily in burials but are also found in general contexts (Griffin 1978: 235-236;
Ritchie 1965: 116, 118, 123, Plate 39). Similar artifacts are generally unknown for the rest of region although
preservation could be a mitigating factor. Shell beads occur in what might be contemporaneous Snook Kill
burials on eastern Long Island (Ritchie 1965: 138) where some marine shell could have been procured without
recourse to trade.

Copper artifacts occur on Brewerton and Frontenac phase sites in central and western New York where
they are found in graves but also occur in general contexts (Funk 1976: 238 Ritchie 1965: 100-101, 118-119;
Ritchie and Funk 1973: 44-45). Only implements or utilitarian items were being exchanged, and not ornaments
(Ritchie 1965: 100-101, 252-253). This is true for other areas of the Middle Atlantic region where copper ar-
tifacts are extremely rare and seem to date to a slightly earlier segment of the Late Archaic period than
the finds in New York (cf. Turnbaugh 1977: 106-107, 109).

The probable source of the copper implements is the Lake Superior area (Griffin 1978: 231; Ritchie 1965:
118-119) and formalized trade relations with the Old Copper Culture of the Upper Great Lakes have been
suggested by previous studies (Ritchie 1965:100-101; Ritchie and Funk 1973: 44-45). Utilitarian objects are
most concentrated in Michigan and Wisconsin (Griffin 1978: 238) nearer the probable source of the copper.
Ford (1974: 395) maintains that even in these areas, the production of items was not continuous.

A third, and final form of exchange can thus be identified. The patchy, discontinuous distributions of
artifacts made from extra-regional and some inter-regional lithics, copper, and shell are reminiscent of hoarded
materials, but do not appear to be items drawn off broad-based exchange networks. It also seems unlikely
that formalized trade relations existed with cultures near source areas since the production and receipt of
trade goods is so sporadic and discontinuous. What does seem probable is that individuals, small groups,
or entrepreneurs from the Middle Atlantic travelled outside of the region on sporadic trading missions, essen-
tially insinuating themselves into the broad-based networks of other areas. The products that traders brought
back were then hoarded within specific social or political territories. This scenario matches the archeological
patterning and also helps to explain why trade items traceable to the Middle Atlantic region are so rare
in adjacent regions. I define this as focused exchange, supplanting previous characterizations (Custer 1982b:
34-36, Table 2; 1984b:63) as high level exchange for reasons detailed in the final section of this paper.

Early Woodland

The Early Woodland period is characterized by a decline in the volume, but not the geographical extent,
of exchanged chipped stone artifacts made from materials originating within the region (Gardner 1984: 10
Hatch and Miller 1985: 227; Rutsch 1970; Stewart 1984a:Figure 6, 31; Wanser 1981: Table 9.1). This pattern
also is observed in adjacent regions (cf. Anthony 1978: 37; Griffin 1986: 611). It is during later portions of
the period, or after 600/500 B.C., that there is a dramatic increase in the quantity and areal distribution
of trade items from outside of the region, and the frequency with which these items are found in graves or
specialized contexts. Added to the inventory of items first recognized during the Late Archaic period are:
ceramics; pipestone or fire/flint clay; Onondaga, Canadian, Indiana, and Tennessee cherts; and slates.

During the earliest portions of the period, until about 600/500 B.C., broad-based exchange networks and
hoarding continue to be evident in the distribution of rhyolite and argillite artifacts and is presumed to be
so for other less traceable materials. Traded projectile points and bifaces are still found primarily in general
contexts and show signs of use as tools. Caches are less frequent. Broad-based exchange of slate pendants


57

can be hypothesized between Elk Island phase sites in the Virginia Piedmont and contemporaneous sites
in distant portions of the Virginia Coastal Plain (Daniel Mouer, 1988 personal communication).

Broad-based exchange and hoarding are also seen in the distribution of soapstone. In general, soapstone-
tempered pottery is as widely distributed, if not more so in many areas, than soapstone vessels were during
Late Archaic times (cf.Steponaitis 1980; Wanser 1982). Exceptions to this generalization can be noted, however.
For example, while soapstone bowls are found in both the Coastal Plain and Piedmont of Virginia, soapstone
tempered pottery is almost exclusively restricted to sites in the Piedmont (Douglas McLearen and Daniel
Mouer, 1988 personal communication).

The use of soapstone vessels continues into the initial phases of the Early Woodland period in associa-
tion with late Orient and other components related to fishtail types of projectile points. Only soapstone bowls
appear with any frequency in burial contexts, and these incidents are limited to the New York end of the
region (Ritchie 1965: 173, Plate 57).

Meadowood phase sites and comparable diagnostic artifacts, 1000 B.C. to 560 B.C. (Ritchie and Funk
1973:96), are generally limited to the northern half of the region. Focused exchange during this phase is
evident in the distribution of Pennsylvania jasper, soapstone, Canadian and Indiana cherts/flints, marine
shell, and Upper Great Lakes copper in central and western New York (Ritchie 1956: 46; 1959; 1965: 190,
195, Plate 60). The majority of traded material ends up in burial contexts. There is a noticeable increase
in the amount of shell ornaments over what is seen in the preceding phases of the Late Archaic. Copper
goods include both utilitarian objects, such as awls and adzes, as well as tubular and spherical beads. Exotic
lithics are expressed as projectiles and bifaces which do not exhibit extensive use as functional implements.
Meadowood-related finds are rare in the Hudson Valley (Funk 1976: 277) and spotty caches and finds of bifaces
and projectile points of Onondaga chert are typical of occurrences in the Delaware Valley and southern por-
tions of the region (cf. Staats 1984). Focused exchange again is indicated by these distributions.

Adena, Middlesex, Delmarva Adena, and other Adena-like phenomena represent the florescence of extra-
regional trade goods in the Middle Atlantic region, generally after 600 B.C. Many of the traits and radiocar-
bon dates associated with these cultural expressions continue to circa A.D. 200, well beyond the 400 B.C.
cutoff for the Early Woodland period employed in this study (Custer 1982b: 70; 1984b: 113-114; 1987; Dragoo
1976b: 5; Ford 1976: 75; Gardner 1982: 70; Seeman 1986: 567).

Ohio Valley sections of western Pennsylvania and West Virginia are part of what Dragoo (1963; 1976b:
6) defines as the Adena homeland, beyond the western edge of the Middle Atlantic region. In western Penn-
sylvania, broad-based exchange may account for the occurrence of bifaces and points made from Ohio, In-
diana, and West Virginia flints/cherts, hematite, ocher, fireclay pipes, and gorgets of slate; ornaments of copper
and marine shell (Marginella and Conch) may relate to focused exchange with coastal areas, the southeastern
Appalachians, or the Upper Great Lakes. These items are most frequently found in mounds and related features
and many appear to have been well used prior to their deposition (Dragoo 1963: 73-132).

In other portions of the Ohio Basin in Pennsylvania, especially the Allegheny Valley, fire clay pipes are
relatively common (Mayer-Oakes 1955: 58-60) and bifaces and points of Ohio and midwestern cherts are
widespread (Fogelman 1983: 7-9, Maps 9, 12) and occur in general site contexts. Pipes, bifaces, and points
continue to be found into more eastern sections of Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and nearby sections
of West Virginia where they occur in general site contexts (Dragoo 1963: 137; Kent et al. 1971: 197-198;
Stewart 1981; Turnbaugh 1977: 178-181; Wall 1981: 25). Many of these finds could represent the tail end
of a broad-based exchange system tied in with Adena centers in western Pennsylvania. Apparent concentra-
tions of these goods are noted for the West Branch of the Susquehanna Valley and portions of a tributary
system, the Juniata Valley, and bespeak of hoarding (Fogelman 1983: Maps 9, 12; Kent et al. 1971: 197-198).
It has long been assumed that the Monongahela-Potomac drainages were a major trade route for Adena-
like exotics reaching the Delmarva Peninsula and points north (Dragoo 1963:137; Ford 1974: 399; Granger
1986; MacCord 1985: 45; Ritchie 1965: 200-201). A small center of mound building, possibly dating to this
period and later times, occurs along sections of the Potomac River as it cuts through the Great Valley, but
its relation with Adena-like phenomena is uncertain (Stewart 1981).

Moving south and west through the Ridge and Valley province of West Virginia and Virginia, traded
Adena-like artifacts are rare or absent and lithics from more northern and western areas in general are poorly
represented (Fowler et al. 1976: 112; McMichael 1970; Stewart 1984a: Figure 6-Transect E). In the Western


58

VOLUME 17, 1989

Virginia Burial Mound Complex (an Adena- and Hopewell-like manifestation) copper ornaments are the on-
ly demonstrably long distance trade items that have been identified (Gardner 1982: 70, 72). Throughout re-
maining sections of Virginia and into North Carolina, tubular pipes of fire clay and Adena point styles (rarely
fashioned from Ohio Valley lithics) are extremely rare (MacCord 1985: 41-44; MacCord and Hranicky 1979:
Figure 3, 35; Thurman 1985: 17). A combination of broad-based and focused exchange is suggested by these
scattered and insignificant distributions.

On the northern margins of the Middle Atlantic region, Adena-like phenomena are tied to the Middlesex
phase defined for New York (cf. Ritchie and Funk 1973: 97). In central New York, copper ornaments and
implements, Marginella and other marine shell beads are common trade items and rarely found outside of
graves (Ritchie 1965: 201). Lacking are chipped stone artifacts of midwestern materials. Middlesex phase
sites are infrequent in the Hudson Valley but when found tend to include the same variety and numbers
of artifacts (Funk 1976: 277).

Spotty Middlesex-like burial localities and finds of diagnostic artifacts can also be noted for upper, mid-
dle, and lower sections of the Delaware Valley (Thomas and Williams 1982: 113-114). The Rosenkrans burial
site in the Upper Delaware Valley of New Jersey exhibits the variety, if not the quantity, of artifacts associated
with mounds in the Adena heartland: tubular pipes, copper ornaments and implements, marine shell beads,
points and bifaces of midwestern flints/cherts (Kinsey 1972: 363-364; Kraft 1976). In addition, bifaces and
points of Canadian and New York cherts occur (Kraft 1976: 39,42). A large quantity of copper beads and
boatstones are associated with a probable Middlesex cremation at the Abbott Farm (New Jersey) in the Mid-
dle Delaware Valley (Cross 1956: 59-60, 62-63 121, 178; Stewart 1982a; 1982: 27; Thurman 1978) and copper
wire has also been recovered from more general contexts (Cross 1956: 41; Stewart 1982a: 3). Bifaces of Ohio
material, copper beads, and fire clay tubular pipes are represented by three additional sites in the southern
New Jersey Coastal Plain, two of which involve burial associations (Mounier 1981). In Pennsylvania sections
of the Delaware Valley and throughout eastern portions of the state, comparable burial sites are unknown,
although bifaces of Ohio material and fire clay tubular pipes are sporadically found (Kent et al. 1971: 197-198).
Delmarva Adena (see Custer 1987b and Thomas 1970, 1987 for reviews) is the most spectacular expres-
sion of long distance trade in the prehistory of the Middle Atlantic region. This phenomena is limited to
portions of the Coastal Plain of coastal Delaware, Maryland, and possibly southern New Jersey (Thomas
1970), and is associated with isolated complex societies (Custer 1984b: 113-130, 1987b). The variety of extra-
regional trade goods at single sites is comparable to that evident in the burial mounds of western Penn-
sylvania and, at some localities, the quantity of artifacts exceeds that recovered from sites in the Adena
heartland (Ford 1976: 75, 86). Included in Delmarva Adena assemblages are: late stage bifaces and projectile
points of midwestern, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee lithics (Custer 1984b: 113-114; Dragoo 1963: 283; Ford
1976: 66; Thomas 1976: 97); copper beads attributed to Lake Superior sources (cf. Thomas 1976: 97); pen-
dants and gorgets of banded slates assumed to be from extra-regional sources (Custer 1982b: 32, 1984b:
113-114); and tubular pipes of Ohio fire clay (Custer 1982b: 32; Thomas 1976: 97). Some of the bifaces and
projectiles in the assemblages are fashioned from jasper, rhyolite, and West Virginia chert and some of the
pipes from limestone, all of which could have been procured from sources within the Middle Atlantic region
(Custer 1984b: 81; Ford 1976: 66, 73, Figure 12). It is also possible that some of the fire clay pipes found
have been fashioned from material from sources located within the region.

The majority of these trade goods occur in burial contexts at a variety of different types of mortuary sites,
although caches and spot finds are noted, some from what could be interpreted as habitation sites (Custer
1984b:113-114, 124). Finished artifacts are generally involved and not raw materials or products in early
stages of manufacture (Custer 1984b: 128). Exceptions can be noted, however, such as the large number of
unfinished gorgets and an undrilled tubular pipe at the Sandy Hill site in the Maryland Coastal Plain (Ford
1976; Ronald Thomas, 1988 personal communication).

The Middlesex and Delmarva Adena data for the Middle Atlantic region fit the expectations of focused
exchange. No chain-like exchanges moving products between the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain and the Adena
heartland can be demonstrated. Few items of coastal origin appear in the areas between the presumed ends
of such a trade connection, or vice versa, suggesting that transactions took place more directly between coastal
folk and groups living near Ohio Valley material sources or production centers. For example, along the Potomac
River in Great Valley sections of Maryland and West Virginia, there is evidence for the existence of complex
societies associated with centers of mound building (Stewart 1981). The connection between this area and


59

the Coastal Plain, as reflected in material culture, is negligible, even though the Potomac River is one presumed
trade route into the Adena heartland and low volume trade in rhyolite can be traced from nearby Blue Ridge
sections of Maryland into the Coastal Plain. Coversely, it can be argued that shell, among other perishables
such as seafood and salt, are invisible on sites of the Middle Atlantic region because of preservation factors
but were in fact, used extensively in exchanges (Ronald Thomas, 1988 personal communication).

Chain-like links between the Coastal Plain and the Northeast may be indicated, however. Ritchie (1965:
200-201) has suggested that the source of Adena materials in New York is the Chesapeake Bay area and
similar types of artifacts occur in portions of the greater Northeast (cf. Johnson and Mahlstedt 1985: 41;
Keith 1965; Snow 1980: 293, 298). If copper beads on Middle Atlantic sites are assumed to be from Lake
Superior sources, then the occurrence on some Northeastern sites of Marginella and Olivella from Middle
Atlantic or more southern sources (Snow 1980: 293, 298) could be reflecting reciprocal trade in Ritchie's scheme.
Individual sites in the Middle Atlantic region show connections with a variety of areas, not just those
in the Adena homeland. The variability of exotic elements in artifact assemblages between sites and geographic
areas also indicates how idiosyncratic trade relations probably were and this variability argues against the
existence of specialized production centers on any end of these networks, as does the relatively low volume
of extra-regional exotics that have been found. Custer (1984b: 128-130) argues, however, that constant trade
relations need not have been maintained with the Ohio Valley because ritual ties, as exemplified by com-
parable burial treatments in both areas, would have provided a link between the societies and one basis for
initiating face-to-face contacts.

Marine shell is the only really visible product, with potential origins in coastal sections of the Middle
Atlantic region, that occurs with any frequency in western Pennsylvania or more midwestern Adena centers.
Perishable organic items may have been used by Middle Atlantic traders in their dealings with Adena folk,
as conjectured by Dragoo (1976b: 5-6). Or is it possible that some of the copper that may have been traded
into the Middle Atlantic region via the Northeast was in turn used by Middle Atlantic people in their deal-
ings with Adena cultures to the west? Although mica is found on sites of the Adena homeland, Middle Atlan-
tic traders from Coastal Plain Delmarva Adena societies would have had to have obtained this material through
exchanges with other Middle Atlantic peoples. There is no concrete evidence to suggest that eastern or Mid-
dle Atlantic region sites were raw material procurement centers for Adena traders as Handsman and McNett
(1974: 41) propose. The fact that sources of fire/flint clay, slate, and copper exist within the region and could
account for some percentage of what has been considered as extra-regional exotics, further dilutes arguments
regarding the existence of formal trade relations between Delmarva Adena groups and distant cultures.
The repeated occurrence of extra-regional goods in burials, and the generally small number of these burials
at a given locality (but see Sandy Hill site -Ford 1976; Ronald Thomas, 1988 personal communication), im-
plies that access to imported items may have been restricted to individuals with importance and rank (Gard-
ner 1982: 71). Perhaps it was only these people who could afford to underwrite trading expeditions outside
of the region as part of the focused exchange system I have postulated here. The traders would not have had
to penetrate or cope with an all-encompassing Adena bureaucracy or hierarchy since the large number and
distribution of Adena mounds argues for the existence of numerous groups operating within small territories
(Seeman 1986: 576).

Although the total picture is far from clear, it can be supposed that considerable variation existed in
the level of complexity of Early Woodland hunting and gathering societies in the region. Yet the distribution
of extra-regional trade items crosscuts what can be assumed to be individual group territories. The level
of social complexity achieved by a group did not preclude its members from procuring exotic items through
trade; but the meanings with which artifacts were imbued and the ways they were used once procured are
idiosyncratic products of these different social organizations.

Middle Woodland

During Middle Woodland times, a continued reduction in the overall volume of intra-regional lithics moving
through broad-based exchange networks is evident in portions of the Middle Atlantic region, especially bet-
ween 400 B.C. and A.D. 200 (Stewart 1984a: 35; Custer 1984b: 134). This occurs at a time when reconstructed
settlement patterns and the distinctiveness of ceramic traditions within the region make it clear that group
territories are not as expansive as those of earlier times (cf. Stewart 1985). Diagnostic artifacts are found


60
60

VOLUME 17, 1989

at rhyolite quarry and quarry-related sites in the Blue Ridge province, but not to the same degree as those
of the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods (Stewart 1984a: 35).

This trend is reversed after A.D. 200 and persists until approximately A.D. 800, as is most evident in
assemblages associated with Fox Creek and related projectile/biface styles, Mockley ceramics and related
variants. The major flow of goods is decidedly from western interior areas out to the Coastal Plain, and then
south and north through coastal areas (cf. Wright 1973: 26). Renewed high levels of exchange are most ob-
vious in the distribution of argillite and rhyolite (Custer 1982b; Funk 1976: 291; Handsman and McNett
1974: 3; Ritchie 1965: 252; Stewart 1982b: 27, 1984a: 35-39; Turnbaugh 1977: 187; Wanser 1981: Table 10.1).
Although Middle Woodland diagnostics are still poorly represented at rhyolite quarry sites in the Blue Ridge,
Middle Woodland chipped stone artifacts are prolific on workshops at the eastern foot of the mountains.
Hoarding is evident on the eastern ends of exchange networks (Figure 3). Argillite and rhyolite projectile
points, early through late stage bifaces, and debitage indicative of tool maintenance and some tool manufac-
turing are found in coastal areas while projectile points and late stage bifaces are more typical of what is
found traded to the west, north, and south of source areas. Artifact frequency distribution plots involving
coastal areas resemble the patterns expected of directional trade or central places. Again, however, the ar-
cheology of the region does not support this interpretation of the artifact patterning in that there is no evidence
of hierarchically ranked sites or locations serving as regional redistribution points.

There is little to be seen of coastal origin in interior areas where rhyolite and argillite artifacts are pro-
duced. There is evidence that some Coastal Plain groups were directly procuring desired materials (Stewart
1983: 62-64). Small amounts of Coastal Plain pottery have been excavated from rockshelters not far from
primary sources and workshops of rhyolite (cf. Geasey 1972). These ceramics are very distinct from what
is being made locally at the time (Stewart 1982c; Kavanagh 1982: 66-68) and further standout because ceramics
in general are extremely rare on sites in this area (Stewart 1983, 1987b: 53-54).

Broad-based exchange may also be responsible for the movement of jaspers from eastern Pennsylvania
into the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain, New York, and the Northeast. In the Delaware Coastal Plain, small
amounts of jasper are associated with Fox Creek sites (Thomas et al. 1974: 5, 7, 8, 18, 19). In New York,
the jasper is associated with Kipp Island phase sites (Jacobson 1980: 33, 35, Table V; Ritchie 1965: 252) which
are generally contemporaneous with Fox Creek sites (Ritchie and Funk 1973: Figure 1) in other portions
of the Middle Atlantic region. As documented by neutron activation analysis, Pennsylvania jasper frequent-
ly appears on Middle Woodland sites in Massachusetts (Luedtke 1984; 1987: 43-45). Artifacts are derived
primarily from general contexts.

In contrast to the above, trade in extra-regional exotics (focused exchange) seems to continue at a consis-
tent volume throughout Middle Woodland times. Evidence of Adena-like phenomena first seen during the
Early Woodland period, including Delmarva Adena and the burial mound complexes of western Maryland,
Virginia, and West Virginia and the Potomac and Shenandoah River valleys, persists to circa A.D. 100/200
and possibly later (Ford 1976: 75; Gardner 1982: 70, 1986: 72-73; Thomas 1973: Figure 1). Both Dragoo (1976b:
5) and Gardner (1982: 70) note that many of the traits associated with these complexes are curious mixtures
of Adena and Hopewell. Hopewellian-like phenomena are also identified at this time in western and central
New York as part of the Squawkie Hill phase (Funk 1976: 298; Griffin 1978: 253-254; Ritchie 1965: 225-226),
burial mound complexes in western Pennsylvania (cf. Mayer-Oakes 1955: Table 1) and West Virginia (Fowler
and Hemmings 1976: 112; Hemmings 1977: 53; McMichael 1968). All of these expressions date to early por-
tions of the Middle Woodland period and partially overlap Fox Creek, Kipp Island, and related phases which
begin circa A.D. 200/300.

In the Allegheny and Ohio Valley sections of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, galena, unworked sheets
of mica, finished tools, blades, flakes, and micro-cores of Flint Ridge chalcedony, and marine shell ornaments
are associated with mound burials and related habitation sites (Mayer-Oakes 1955: Table 1; Hemmings 1977:
53). Classic Hopewell sherds, ostensibly from vessels gained in trade, are also found in small quantities in
general site contexts (Mayer-Oakes 1952). Cache blades of Flint Ridge material are also a common object
scattered throughout all of western Pennsylvania (Kent et al. 1971: 264). The distribution of Ohio Valley
lithics could represent the edge of broad-based exchange networks or hoarding in some instances. The mica
and galena could represent focused exchange or direct procurement since sources of these materials are not
that far removed from the areas where they occur as artifacts in prehistoric contexts. Ceramics and marine
shell are more likely the result of focused exchange. In southwestern Virginia, there is growing evidence

of potential Hopewellian influence in the occurrence of prismatic blades, polyhedral cores, and the use of
sheet mica (Mcllhany 1983; Randolph Turner, 1988 personal communication). Influence and the movement
of goods seems to be via western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee during the Conestee phase.

Farther east, a somewhat similar array of artifacts are associated with burial mound complexes in the
Great Valley of Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia including Marginella beads, mica sheets, quartz crystals,
copper crescents and beads, blades of Ohio Valley cherts/flints, and gorgets of Carolina slates (Gardner 1986:
72-73; Schmitt 1952: 60-61). Blades of Flint Ridge chalcedony, mica, and conch columella beads also occur
in quantity in an isolated section of the Juniata River valley in nearby central Pennsylvania (cf. Kent et
al. 1971: 264-265). This occurrence is even more outstanding because of the dramatic lack of similar materials
in adjacent watersheds of central Pennsylvania (Turnbaugh 1977: 202-204). Focused exchange is indicated
by these distributions, although mica and copper could be derived from relatively nearby sources. No attempts
have been made to precisely source these materials.

Focused exchange can also be seen in Hopewellian manifestations in western and central New York and
involve platform pipes of Ohio fire clay, a variety of copper ornaments, copper celts and awls, mica sheets,
and points and flake knives of Ohio Valley cherts (Ritchie 1965: 225-226). These goods are rare as grave offer-
ings. In the following Kipp Island phase of central and eastern New York, the frequency of copper ornaments
and implements decreases (Ritchie 1965: 252-253) and ties with eastern and southern Coastal Plain areas
are emphasized by the occurrence of Busycon, Marginella, and Olivella beads and sharks teeth (Jacobson
1980: 33, 35, Table V; Ritchie 1965: 247-248, 252). The coastal connection remains preeminent during the
final Hunters Home phase of the Middle Woodland, and copper artifacts are exceedingly rare (cf. Ritchie
1965: Plate 87).

Tb the south and after A.D. 200, there are few extra-regional goods found on the Middle Woodland sites
of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of the Middle Atlantic region. Copper ornaments are occasionally found
in the Middle Delaware Valley but could be fashioned from native sources also located within the valley
(Stewart 1982a: 3; 1982b: 27). Bifaces or blades of Flint Ridge material are very rare on the Delmarva Penin-
sula (Thomas et al. 1974:5, 7, 8, 18, 19). The Webb Complex in this area, dated after A.D. 700, is a dramatic
expression of focused exchange, exhibiting connections with a number of areas beyond the Middle Atlantic
region (cf. Custer 1984b: 136-143). Exchanged items figure prominently in mortuary practices. Both the ex-
tent of this trade and its social context seem to be unusual for the region at-large. Other complexes in which
long distance trade may have been important occur in coastal sections of New Jersey and Virginia. Relevant
sites, such as Abbott Farm, Hatch, and Maycock Point, are fingerprinted by the extremely geographically
discontinuous occurrence of aberrant zone-decorated ceramics made on Mockley and Mockley-like ceramic
bodies (Gregory 1980, 1983; Anthony Opperman, 1988 personal communication; Randolph Turner, 1988 per-
sonal communication).

Tb summarize, during the Middle Woodland period, a number of trade cycles are evident. For the region
as a whole, the volume of exchange of intra-regional products is greatest during the later half of the period
while the exchange of goods from sources outside of the region persists from the earliest portions of the Mid-
dle Woodland until at least A.D. 500/600. The distribution of copper artifacts is especially revealing. The
frequency of these occurrences declines dramatically after A.D. 200/300, and throughout Middle Woodland
times copper artifacts are conspicuously meager in the region's mid-section. This patterning suggests that
copper artifacts found to the north are from Great Lakes sources while those found in the south are from
southeastern sources or sources from within the Middle Atlantic region itself. It is interesting, therefore,
that sourcing studies in the Southeast have shown a preponderance of Great Lakes copper in the eastern
segments of this region (Goad 1979: 242). Sourcing studies of Middle Atlantic copper artifacts are needed
to unravel this situation.

Middle Woodland exchange systems are comparable to those of earlier times and show no greater degree
of systematization, contrary to previous characterizations (Handsman and McNett 1974: 34). I also feel that
there is no evidence of any formal relations between societies of the Middle Atlantic region and those of the
Hopewell heartland. The variety and frequency of trade goods vary from locality to locality and items of
exchange appear in the deposits of both simple and complex societies. Struever and Houart (1972: 64) sug-
gest that major trading between Hopewell and eastern societies involved groups in areas where suites of
raw material or artifacts could be obtained rather than single items. In such a scenario, North Carolina and
points south would have more to offer than the Middle Atlantic region.


63

Hopewellian systems themselves are highly variable, operating on different scales, and are not as struc-
tured or formalized as originally thought (Struever and Houart 1972: 60; Thunen and Brown 1985; Winters
1984). In fact, it has been suggested that the idea of a Hopewellian cult/interaction sphere is not supported
(Winters 1984) and the density and distribution of goods in the Hopewell heartland imply a combination
of direct procurement, home-based and down-the-line exchange (Thunen and Brown 1985). It would, therefore,
have been easier for Middle Atlantic traders to insinuate themselves into a variety of Hopewellian societies
without the need for highly structured or ritualized relations. The fact that goods from the Ohio Valley and
other areas continue to flow into the Middle Atlantic region after the decline of Hopewell, and in quantities
comparable to those of Hopewellian times, also argues against the existence of highly structured trade relations.

Late Woodland

Frequency distributions of rhyolite and argillite (see Figure 3) artifacts, among other materials, suggest
that broad-based exchange networks were disrupted or severely attenuated, and focused exchange dramatically
altered during the Late Woodland period (Custer 1984b: 146; Custer and Griffith 1986: 50-51; Ritchie 1965:
293; Stewart 1984a: 39; Wanser 1981: Table 11.1). The volume of intra-regional lithic goods moving through
broad-based systems are a fraction of what they were during earlier times and consist largely of triangular
projectile points/bifaces that were well-used and discarded in general contexts. Rhyolite and argillite debitage
found on distant sites seems to be the exclusive result of maintaining late stage bifaces/projectiles. The decline
in exchange is also reflected by changes at the production end of the system. Artifacts diagnostic of the Late
Woodland period are rarely found on quarry-related sites but do appear in varying degrees at workshops
(cf. Stewart 1983: 65-66). Individual Late Woodland settlement territories appear to be smaller than those
of Middle Woodland times, ranging between 30 and 40 miles in greatest linear dimension (cf. Stewart 1985).
This makes the decline in the broad-based exchange of stone tools even more dramatic There is little evidence
of selective hoarding of goods within group territories. During earlier periods, some of the most noticeable
occurrences of hoarding were associated with the territories of complex societies. A number of complex societies
can also be identified during the Late Woodland period (cf. Custer and Griffith 1986: 34, 50-51; Stewart,
in press) but cannot be associated with the hoarding of traded materials. West to east and south to north
trends in the movement of exchanged items can be noted (Custer and Griffith 1986: 31; Kraft and Mounier
1982: 141) even with the overall decline in trade, and parallels the patterning evident during the Middle
Woodland period. Notable is the continued trade of Pennsylvania jaspers into the Northeast (Lavin 1983, 1984).
Soapstone artifacts and raw material once moved through the region as part of broad-based exchange
systems. During the Late Woodland period, extremely spotty distributions of soapstone pipes, ornaments,
and carvings seem to be the result of focused exchange. Pipes and ornaments appear both in general site
contexts (cf. Stewart 1987c: VI43-VI46) and in burials including mound interments (cf. Holland et al. 1983:
26; MacCord and Buchanan 1980: 85-102; Valliere and MacCord 1986: 51). Carved effigies or figurines occur
much less frequently and have been found in both general and burial contexts (Parris 1985: 13; Thomas 1972:
12; Thomas et al. 1985: V-l, V-2). Pipes may have been traded in low volumes between the Middle Atlantic
region and the Midwest at this time (Seeman 1981: 105).

Ceramic vessels and pipes may have been traded through both broad-based systems and focused exchange.
For example, ceramics from the Ridge and Valley province and Maryland's Inner Coastal Plain appear in
the northern Delmarva Peninsula (Custer and Griffith 1986: 52, 56; Stocum 1977) and wares from western
Pennsylvania occur throughout the lower Susquehanna Valley and the eastern portions of the state (Kent
1984: 117-124). The distribution of sixteenth century Schultz Incised ceramics outside of the traditional ter-
ritory of its makers, the Susquehannock Indians of Pennsylvania, is almost certainly the result of exchanges
between wide-ranging trading parties of these Indians with indigenous folk, given the habits of the Sus-
quehannocks documented during later historic times (Kent 1984). In contrast, ceramic exchange has been
documented between two adjacent yet distinctive territories (cf. Stewart 1985; Kuhn 1987; Phelps 1983: 37)
and is suggestive of geographically attenuated, broad-based exchange. The volume of ceramic exchange seems
to be extremely low (cf. Gardner 1986: 82-83, 87) although trace element analysis may provide an entirely
different perspective on this issue (Kuhn 1987: 306). Traded ceramics are found most frequently in general
site contexts although burial associations are also known.

The volume and extent of Late Woodland trade in marine shell ornaments and unmodified shell increases
markedly over the trends of earlier times. It is the only material/artifact that exhibits such a trend during


64
64

VOLUME 17, 1989

a time when dramatic decreases characterize the exchange of other items. Goods appear to be moving through
well-defined broad-based exchange networks linking the Atlantic Coastal Plain with the Appalachian area
in the southern half of the Middle Atlantic region. The frequency distributions of marine shell artifacts in
the northern half of the region, however, resemble the focused exchange of shell items identified during earlier
times. Shell artifacts occur most frequently in association with burials of both sexes and all age classes,
regardless of location within the region or the inferred mode of exchange. No cycles in the Late Woodland
exchange of shell can be discerned; artifacts occur in radiocarbon-dated contexts spanning the entire period
(cf. MacCord 1986: 8-10; Pousson 1983: 123-124).

In coastal Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, Busycon, Marginella, and Olivella shell beads and
occasional Busycon hoes or picks are found in burial and general site contexts (Phelps 1983: 39, 50-51; Stephen-
son and Ferguson 1963: 162-163, 197). In these areas shell may have been procured directly or through broad-
based exchange networks linking various Coastal Plain cultures. Regular occurrences of shell artifacts con-
tinue through the Piedmont into the Shenandoah Valley and Ridge and Valley province in general, again
largely associated with burials (Gardner 1984: 9; 1986: 82-83, 87; MacCord 1986: Table VI, 8-10; Phelps 1983:
39, 50-51; Pousson 1983: 123-124; Valliere and MacCord 1986: 52). In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia,
sporadic occurrences of sharks teeth are noted on sites where shell beads are also found (MacCord 1986:
8-10). Moving west onto the Appalachian Plateau and into the Monongahela River drainage of Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, shell ornaments (most often Marginella beads) continue to occur in all types of burials
and general site contexts but in much reduced numbers (Baker 1981: 24; Boyce-Ballweber 1987: 49; 49; Davis
1984: Table 1; Dunnell 1962: 3; Herbstritt 1981: 33; Mayer-Oakes 1955: 15, Table 4, Figure 4). Their affilia-
tion is with Monongahela, late prehistoric, and Fort Ancient cultures showing the persistence of this type
of trade throughout Late Woodland times.

Hoarding is suggested by the abundance of Busycon, Marginella, Olivella shell beads and pendants in
the Ridge and Valley section of southwestern Virginia (cf. Holland 1970: Table 4, 96, 116; MacCord and
Buchanan 1980: 80-82, 85-102). Finds in burials and general site contexts are equally prolific. Marine shell
artifacts are associated with both adult and child burials (cf. MacCord 1981: 100-101; MacCord and Buchanan
1980: 85-102). The obvious trade connection is to the southeast and, late in the period, to Mississippian cultures
(Holland 1970: 116; Wedel 1951: Figures 1-3). It is of interest to note that maps of Indian trade routes in
existence during historic times show connections between Virginia and Southeastern tribes (Hudson 1976:
271).

Through the middle and upper sections of the Delaware River drainage and points north, the distribu-
tion of shell artifacts is sporadic and suggestive of focused exchange (cf. Ritchie 1965: 253-324). Marine shell
beads and pendants are even rare in areas where shellfish was a major component of aboriginal subsistence
(cf. Ritchie 1965: 267, 271). Sharks teeth pendants are part of the Hunters Home phase of late Middle/early
Late Woodland times in New York but are not found later (Ritchie 1965: 255, Plate 87).

The spatial patterning of copper artifacts generally mirrors that of shell items; the greatest frequencies
and broadest distributions are seen in the southern half of the Middle Atlantic region with extremely spotty
finds typifying the basins of the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers and points north. However, the volume
of copper trade goods in no way matches that of shell and in most cases artifact distributions are indicative
of focused, rather than broad-based, exchange. In the Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina Coastal Plains, tubular
copper beads, and occasionally pendants, are associated with burials (cf. Phelps 1983: 39, 44, 46, 50-51; Thur-
man 1973: 37,39). The Great Lakes region has been determined to be the source of some of the copper ap-
pearing in Maryland (Thurman 1973: 39). Copper beads and pendants continue to occur in burials in more
interior portions of Virginia and North Carolina (Holland et al. 1983: 1-9; Phelps 1983: 50-51) and reach
their greatest frequencies in the Ridge and Valley section of southwestern Virginia (cf. Holland 1970: 116;
MacCord 1973: 48-49; MacCord and Buchanan 1980: 85-102; Wedel 1951: Figures 1-3). Spectrographic analysis
has shown that some of the copper is from sources in Virginia (MacCord 1973: 48-49; MacCord and Buchanan
1980: 118). It is possible, therefore, that some groups inhabiting southwest Virginia were procuring the material
directly. It also would not be unreasonable to encounter North Carolina/Tennessee copper on Late Woodland
sites in this area because of their proximity to these major sources and the obvious trade connection southwest
Virginia has to the Southeast as evinced by the distribution of marine shell artifacts. Hoarding of items
obtained through broad-based exchange systems can be inferred on the basis of this patterning.


65

The extremely limited distribution of copper artifacts in the northern half of the Middle Atlantic region
fits the expectations of focused exchange. Copper ornaments are known from pit features and general site
contexts in the Delaware Valley (cf. Stewart et al. 1986: 69). Finds of copper artifacts are even rarer farther
north and seem to be associated only with early phases of the Late Woodland period (Ritchie 1965: 255) and
protohistoric or contact period sites (Bradley 1987: 39; Kuhn 1987: 305). Physical analyses have not been
performed to determine if Great Lakes or southern sources are represented. Further, Bradley (1987: 41) notes
that some of the copper that appears in the Northeast at this time are from sources in Nova Scotia, another
potential point of origin for copper artifacts in the Middle Atlantic region.

Of all of the trade goods that are known for the Late Woodland period, artifacts made from rock with
sources outside of the region are the most poorly represented. Chert/flint projectile points and debitage at-
tributed to sources at Flint Ridge and the Ohio Valley have been found in the Coastal Plain (Custer and
Rosenberg 1988; Jacobson 1980: 39) and probably represent focused exchange. Similar materials identified
at sites on the Appalachian Plateau of Maryland (Boyce-Ballweber 1987: 15) and Pennsylvania (George 1983:
51) may constitute the distant end of broad-based exchange networks emanating from the Ohio Valley through
western Pennsylvania. Focused exchanged is indicated by the sporadic occurrence of beads fashioned from
Wisconsin or Minnesota catlinite (Kent 1984: 165-171; Kuhn 1987: 305) and the extraordinary find of a jade
figurine attributed to a Mexican source (Thomas 1972: 12).

In summary, the Late Woodland period shows the prehistoric peoples of the Middle Atlantic region becom-
ing more insular in their relationships with others than were their predecessors, at least from the narrow
perspective of artifacts that can be identified as traded material. No trade cycles can be discerned as could
during the Middle Woodland period although the level of systematization of exchange networks, or lack thereof,
is comparable. The fact that midwestern and Ohio Valley goods continue to appear on Late Woodland sites
of the Middle Atlantic region (albeit in small quantities) indirectly supports previous contentions that Mid-
dle and Early Woodland ties with the Ohio Valley and Adena and Hopewell heartlands need not have involv-
ed institutionalized or ritual relationships. The southern half of the Middle Atlantic region stands out as
an area where marine shell and copper are the mainstays of an exchange network once dominated by intra-
regional lithics. This patterning reaffirms that broad-based and focused exchange networks are distinct en-
tities and served different purposes.

Models and the Cultural Ecology of Trade and Exchange

Two major types of co-existing exchange, broad-based networks and focused networks, can be identified
in the Middle Atlantic region and are evident from Late Archaic through Late Woodland times. Broad-based
networks are characterized by hand-to-hand, down-the-line exchange and web-like relationships common
throughout the region. John Smith's seventeenth century descriptions of aboriginal trade in New England
depict what may be envisioned as similar patterns (Smith 1624 reproduced in Levermore 1912: 676). Goods
originating within the Middle Atlantic region are involved most often in transactions. Traded items are broadly
distributed and generally exhibit gradually declining frequencies with increasing distance from ar-
tifact/material sources. Broad-based networks are manipulated periodically by some groups who hoard trade
items within their home territories. Exchanged artifacts are used in the same ways as their locally derived
counterparts and are eventually discarded in all manner of contexts, both sacred and profane.

The broad-based exchange systems correspond with what I have previously described as kin-based shar-
ing and exchange and related hoarding (Stewart 1984a: 30-31), and what Custer (1982b: Table 1, 32, 34;
1984a: 62; 1984c: 43) has referred to as localized web-like networks and low level exchange systems. Each
of these earlier assessments is in general agreement; predominantly technomic artifacts and ornaments are
circulated through a series of web-like or chain-like personalized relationships.

Custer (1984c: 41-43) distinguishes the long range movement of such items as rhyolite and argillite ar-
tifacts as the result of a different, long-range network. In such networks, chain-like sets of exchange part-
ners move goods over long distances and artifacts and materials are largely removed from general consumption
along the way. The chain-like exchanges are envisioned as a product of ritualized trading partnerships and
not the moral suasion or personal acquaintance of individuals (Custer 1984c: 42).

Admittedly, no matter what the scale involved, repeated trade relations or partnerships, whether based
on real or fictive kin ties or individual motivation, would logically become ritualized or formalized to some


66
66

VOLUME 17, 1989

degree. Ouster's long distance system is essentially broad-based exchange writ large. It exhibits gradual
declines in the frequency of traded goods with increasing distance from the sources of materials or products,
the use of exchanged goods as functional implements, and their eventual discard in general site contexts,
the same as items involved in more short-range exchanges.

The hoarding of items gained through broad-based exchange networks within a territory, and the occur-
rence of some of these goods in specialized contexts, clearly shows that the meaning of exchanged artifacts
can be changed and/or manipulated by the receiver and is not necessarily a function of the exchange system
itself. Pires-Ferreira and Flannery (1976) reach a similar conclusion using ethnographic data in analyzing
Mesoamerican trade.

Focused networks are typified by the exchange of goods from areas outside of the Middle Atlantic region
and some sources located within the region. These networks probably involved relatively few contacts, not
the series of interlocked, down-the-line transactions associated with broad-based systems. Artifacts related
to focused networks show extremely discontinuous spatial distributions, not down-the-line decreases, and
are found in both burial and general site contexts. While some exchanged items show signs of having served
functional lives prior to being discarded, others do not.

Focused exchange encompasses Ouster's (1982b: Table 1, 32, 34; 1984a: 63) previous definition of high
level exchange networks, with some qualifications. High level networks are associated with complex social
and ritual relationships and mortuary behavior. They are thought to involve larger volumes of non-local ar-
tifacts and materials than other networks, and items with both intra- and extra-regional sources. However,
concentrations (hoarded) of trade goods, made from materials with either intra- or extra-regional sources,
are not always associated with developing complex societies or burial ceremonialism in the Middle Atlantic
region. Conversely, while the frequency of exchanged products is certainly important, status and power can
be imbued in single symbolic items or goods that are labor intensive to produce but not really exotic to an
area (cf. Gero 1985; Hall 1977: 505; Kuhn 1987: 306). Social recognition or status can also be derived from
participation in an exchange system, and not the accumulation of capital or material wealth (Handsman
and McNett 1974: 36).

No matter the type of trade involved, goods or information (Michlovic 1976) are exchanged as a result
of personal interactions. There are a number of behaviors and relationships that would be expected to occur
in hunting and gathering societies that, either singly or in concert, could account for the movement of goods
and the archeological patterning identified as broad-based exchange: obligatory sharing and gift-giving found-
ed on ties of real or putative kinship (cf. Gould 1980: 85); fusion-fission settlement and subsistence patterns
(cf. Ouster 1984c: 42-43); the payment of bride wealth in conjunction with exogamous marriage rules (Sahlins
1972: 221-222); the establishment of personal trading partners; and the practice of redistributing goods as
part of communal feasting or rituals. Any networks created as a result of these phenomena would be generally
informal with no precise beginnings or ends, spatially dendritic or web-like, interlocked in series, and main-
tained by the opportunistic actions of individuals. Since any such networks would include personal kindreds
and relationships, the needs, wants, and preferences of an individual could influence what and how much
moved through a given portion of an exchange system. In some circumstances then, the hoarding of exchang-
ed goods within a territory could represent the idiosyncratic behavior of individuals. Egalitarian social
organizations are probably not a uniform characteristic of hunting and gathering societies (Price and Brown
1985: 12) and thus manipulations of exchange systems by individual's seeking status, or for the purpose of
forging particular alliances, are to be expected.

Broad-based exchange and hoarding also can be linked with complex societies and the behaviors that
bind them. Given the positive feedback loop shown to exist between social hierarchies and exchange, higher
frequencies of trade goods can be expected to occur in territories where social differentiation and ritual ex-
pressions are greatest (Hodder 1980: 153; Price 1981; 1982: 731-733). Lineage heads or Big Man types of
leaders are often the individuals who initiate trade with other groups (cf. Brose 1979: 7-8) or who manage
special rituals, communal feasting, or labor projects during which goods may be redistributed (Brose 1979;
Cissna 1986: 26; Ouster 1982b: 34; Price 1981). The exchange of symbolically charged items also serves to
cement political or spiritual alliances (cf. Kuhn 1987: 306).

Focused exchange seems even more closely tied to the motivations of individuals. Given the relationship
between status, complex societies, burial ceremonialism, exchange and exotic goods, it is likely that high
ranking individuals or lineage heads subsidized long-range trading expeditions. The collection of tribute


67

as part of the management of chiefdoms, such as the Powhatan chiefdom in seventeenth century Virginia
(Potter 1989), also results in the concentration and redistribution of goods gained in trade, which would ar-
cheologically resemble focused exchange. In such societies, chiefs controlled the trade of items like copper
(Potter 1989), whose prehistoric frequency distributions region-wide I have attributed to focused exchange.
The Powhatan chiefdom has roots in the Late Woodland period (Turner 1986: 21, 25) and its archeological
correlates (or lack thereof) suggest that other equally complex societies may have existed in the Middle Atlantic
region (Custer 1986).

Exchange itself cannot be assumed to be the raison d'etre for the existence of broad-based networks. Ex-
change is a cog in cultural mechanisms aimed at promoting inter-group communications, reducing the poten-
tial for conflict or mitigating actual conflict, and establishing an individual's, family's, or group's access to
resources or hospitality beyond their home territories. In ethnographically observed kin-based and reciprocal
exchange, an individual attempts to obligate as many people as possible, enlarging his circle of friends or
people that can be called upon for favors (Gould 1980: 85, 153). Such obligations provide for potential hospitali-
ty,allies, and access to resources beyond an individual's common territory, especially during times of resource
failures and other crises (Brose 1979: 7-8; Custer 1984b: 111; Dalton 1977; Ford 1974: 394; Hodder 1980:
154; Simms 1979). Brose (1979) categorizes this as "subsistence insurance." Expansive personal kindreds
and personal relationships, and extensive exchange networks appear to be greatest in areas where resources
are subject to severe fluctuations (Gould 1980: 85, 157).

In such a model of exchange, the artifacts that we recognize archeologically as trade goods would be only
the tip of a much larger iceberg probably involving foodstuffs, skins, and other perishables. Pires-Ferreira
and Flannery (1976: 289-290) argue that when a series of exchange networks are involved, such as is propos-
ed for broad-based systems, the movement of both subsistence/utilitarian goods and "exotic" items is further
insurance that the utilitarian needs of diverse individuals in the various exchange linkages will be served.
Transplanting this argument to the Middle Atlantic region, should we not then think of trade goods such
as rhyolite and argillite projectiles as the exotic items that keep the archeologically invisible (perishable)
necessities moving through the exchange systems, and not as the more mundane objects of these systems?
Given the hypothesized nature and intent of broad-based exchange, it can be presumed that transactions
took place year-round and at a variety of settlement types. Thus, archeological evidence of broad-based ex-
change should not be limited to a specific site type or season of the year.

Focused exchange could also serve social functions similar to those outlined for broad-based exchange.
However, the somewhat remote and discontinuous social connections implied by artifact distributions sug-
gests that the primary aim of focused exchange was the acquisition of exotic goods, which were then used
for various social ends by the recipient in his home territory. When environmental conditions or subsistence
technology promotes stability, and competition for circumscribed resources is not a factor, only the most wealthy
individuals in a group will systematically engage in long-distance trade (Brose 1979: 8). Focused exchange
co-exists with broad-based systems although the two do not seem to be inter-dependent.

Focused exchange may have been practiced on a more seasonal basis than broad-based exchange.
Ethnohistoric accounts from the Middle Atlantic region suggest that aboriginal "trading" occurred and peaked
between June and September, after crops had been planted (Acreluis 1874: 54; Wallace 1947: 16-17). This
would have been an ideal time to underwrite trading expeditions since groups throughout the region would
have been relatively sedentary and located in obvious, well known settlements (at least during Middle and
Late Woodland times), and the logistics of long-distance travel would have been easier to manage than dur-
ing the colder months of the year. Following this reasoning further, it would then be expected that the greatest
concentrations of goods gained through focused exchange should be found on major habitation or related
sites occupied during the summer to fall.

Why does the first evidence of concerted exchange of any type date to the Late Archaic period? Evidence
of broad-based and focused exchange appear at the same time as a number of other phenomena that crosscut
a variety of geographic areas and cultural adaptations in the region. Marked territoriality, and possibly ethnic
diversity (Brose 1979 citing Barth 1969), is evident in the dramatic regionalization of artifact styles and
the suites of lithic materials that are exploited for tool manufacturing (with emphasis on locally abundant
sources). Exploitative territories appear to be smaller than those of Middle Archaic times. A variety of site
types appear to be consistently reused on a relatively short-term cycle, as can be inferred from the size and


68

depositional intensity of archeological deposits. This implies that settlement and subsistence patterns are
more regularized and resources more cyclically exploited than ever before. The cyclical use of site locations
and resources in turn may be viewed as an expression of territoriality (cf. Cleland 1976: 65). Dramatic popula-
tion growth can also be inferred from the literal explosion in the high frequency and broad distributions
of Late Archaic sites (cf. Catlin et al. 1982; Turner 1978). The periodicity and high amplitude of Late Ar-
chaic climatic fluctuations can be contrasted with the relatively gradual changes of earlier times (Custer
1980). Custer (1984c) postulates that environmental change during this time, in conjunction with the factors
just noted, resulted in a realignment in the distribution and timing of availability of resources that had been
traditionally exploited by aboriginal groups, the end result being a spatial re-orientation of groups and ex-
ploitative territories.

The net effect of the conditions outlined above is that more people are coming into more frequent contact
with one another and are having to cope with the attendant problems. These conditions have consistently
been linked to the flourishing of trade and exchange; the social relations and opportunities that are embedd-
ed in the exchange of material goods provide a margin of economic and political security or insurance for
times of uncertainty (Braun and Plog 1982; Brose 1979; Custer 1984c; Ford 1974: 394; Hodder 1980; Simms
1979: 31; Stewart 1984a: 30-31).

During the Late Archaic period, the first evidence of complex societies is seen in isolated examples of
both burial ceremonialism (Regensburg 1971; n.d.) and settlement systems based upon highly productive
and predictable resources that are circumscribed (Custer 1984b: 107-113). Given the presumed importance
of social hierarchies and the communication of status in these systems, it is significant that these same
geographic areas (sections of coastal New Jersey and Delaware) show the earliest evidence of focused ex-
change, and that evidence of focused exchange and concentrations of goods hoarded from broad-based ex-
change networks reappear in them through time (Custer 1982b: Tkble 1, 34-36). This is not to say that hoarding
and focused exchange are limited to complex societies, but rather that the dynamics of complex social systems
provide continual positive reinforcement for trade (Custer 1984c: 41).

The conditions fostering exchange during the Late Archaic period are not ameliorated during later
prehistoric times and if anything, are magnified. Populations, if not growing, at least remain at levels com-
parable to the Late Archaic. Stylistic and exploitative territories, on the other hand, contract from Late Ar-
chaic times through the Late Woodland period. Although still not a region-wide phenomena, complex hunting
and gathering societies can be noted for distinctive portions of the Middle Atlantic region through time.
The gradual decline through time in the exchange of artifacts made from materials with intra-regional
sources is puzzling. At least through early portions of the Middle Woodland period, the trade in extra-regional
products offsets the decline in the movement of intra-regional goods. It is possible that through time, perishable
goods are used more frequently in transactions and these are simply not well preserved in archeological
deposits. It is also possible that trade relations are left increasingly in the hands of real or putative heads
of kin groups or communities and that exchanges involve fewer, but more symbolically powerful items (cf.
Hall 1977; Kuhn 1987: 306). For some Coastal Plain areas, Custer (1982b: 35-36) relates disruptions in the
practice of burial rituals and exchange to a reduction in the extent of highly productive circumscribed en-
vironments and the opting for economic adaptations stressing group fissioning rather than more complex
forms of social organization and management of subsistence strategies.

The Late Woodland period, a time when sedentary agricultural villages or base camps (and eventually
stockaded villages) characterize large portions of the region, is enigmatic regarding trade and exchange. The
lack of trade goods is especially obvious in areas where burial ceremonialism associated with mounds is prac-
ticed (cf. MacCord 1986; Stewart 1988). This is a time when the ancillary benefits of exchange would have
been most useful and yet archeologically visible traces of trade are at their lowest ebb throughout much
of the Middle Atlantic region. Brose (1979: 8) suggests that reliance on an agricultural subsistence base and
storage technology offset many of the economic uncertainties that previously stimulated trade relations. Mac-
Cord (1984), Gardner (1986: 79-80), and Custer (1987a) feel that there is evidence for small, but dramatic
population movements during the Late Woodland period. This may have disrupted traditional networks but
would not necessarily have supplanted the need for or utility of trade relations. Fiedel (1987) also builds
a case fora prehistoric Algonquian migration into the Middle Atlantic region on the basis of linguistic evidence
and suggests that it occurred midway to late in the Middle Woodland period (1988 personal communication).
He speculates that one reason why people are not trading much late in Middle Woodland times, or during


69

the Late Woodland period, is because there are language barriers impeding communication.

The problems facing studies of trade and exchange in the Middle Atlantic region are numerous and can
be approached in a variety of ways. Because trade and exchange are imbedded in Late Archaic through Late
Woodland cultural systems, literally any type of archeological progress in the region will aid future attempts
at understanding the puzzles that now confront us. This paper has hopefully assembled in one place many
of the puzzle pieces and the previous efforts of others to unravel them.
