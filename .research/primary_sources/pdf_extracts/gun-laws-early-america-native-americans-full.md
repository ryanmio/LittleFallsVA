 Gun Laws in Early America: The Regulation
 of Firearms Ownership, 1607-1794

 MICHAEL A. BELLESILES

 King James I stated the official position of the English governing elite on
 gun ownership succinctly. When it was suggested that more of England's
 subjects should enjoy the right to hunt and own firearms, James respond-
 ed that "it is not fit that clowns should have these sports."'

 Discussion of early American gun laws begins with consideration of the
 English legal heritage. In the last few years, adherents of the self-described
 "standard model" of the meaning of the Second Amendment have con-
 structed a paradigm of an uninterrupted tradition of legally sanctioned in-
 dividual gun ownership in America. Such a construction starts with the idea

 that the British brought an acceptance of the universal ownership of fire-
 arms with them to the Americas.2 That cultural norm gave form to the

 meaning of the Second Amendment, which institutionalized an individual
 right to bear arms for purposes of personal and communal defense and as
 a security against a tyrannical government. This history matters greatly to
 these scholars in establishing an original intent in the Second Amendment
 to protect an individual's right to own guns.3

 At the very least, one must admire these adherents of an individual read-
 ing of the Second Amendment as master rhetoricians. While insisting that
 they are concerned only with original intent, the promoters of "the new
 consensus" frame their arguments in terms of current policy disputes. Don
 Kates and Randy Barnett have recently declared the total victory of the
 "new consensus," to which school "every constitutional scholar who has
 studied the Second Amendment" belongs.4 Though they find that "legal
 scholars and historians" have concluded, "with virtual unanimity, that there
 is no tenable textual or historical argument against a broad individual right
 view of the Second Amendment," Kates and Barett acknowledge that there
 are a few exceptions to this "near-unanimous consensus."5 But then those
 who fail to agree with the individualist formulation-scholars ranging from
 former Chief Justice Warren Burger to historians Lawrence Cress and Jack
 Rakove to the polymath Garry Wills-are easily dismissed as not serious
 constitutional scholars, "prohibitionists" and "confiscators," driving reason-

 able people into the arms of the NRA. It is immodest for participants in a
 bitter debate to proclaim not only that they have a monopoly on the truth
 but also that they have no opposition.6

 Sadly, scholars have divided into two camps in their acrimonious debate
 over the reading of the origins of the Second Amendment-perhaps because
 so many are also lawyers wedded to the adversarial style. There are those
 on the other, "collective rights," side of the debate who have been equally
 mean spirited. Andrew Herz dismissed supporters of the individualist view
 of the Second Amendment as essentially hacks for the National Rifle As-
 sociation, a grotesquely unfair charge.7 Each side caricatures the other while
 structuring a narrative of early American history supportive of current
 policy goals, willfully attempting to transform the past to meet individual
 conceptions of the most useful origins of the Second Amendment. But the
 issue is not and never has been the false dichotomy established by polem-
 icists between an absolute right to gun ownership versus confiscation.
 Legally and historically, Second Amendment questions revolve around
 degrees of regulation.

 The history of early American statute law can supply ample evidence for
 the contrary positions in this debate, just as anyone can locate a number
 of supportive quotations from eighteenth-century political thinkers who
 struggled with the exact meaning of "rights."8 History should be more than
 the stringing together of carefully selected quotations; the aggregate mat-
 ters. Like historians who once saw colonial America as a liberty-loving
 prelude to the American Revolution, conveniently ignoring Puritan intol-

 erance and the institution of slavery, moder scholars of the Second Amend-
 ment tell part, but not all, of the story of America's gun heritage. But then
 it is not a pretty story, and neither side in the policy debate should be com-
 fortable calling upon the original intent outlined in this essay. As scholars
 we should be concerned with the events of the time under study, rather than
 with their implication for modern policy struggles.

 Protestations of noninvolvement in current debates may be questioned
 as disingenuous. Nonetheless, the purpose of this essay is simply to exam-
 ine the statute law context of the Second Amendment. Those who have

 written on the Second Amendment have treated it largely as an intellectu-
 al construct existing in a social vacuum. Randy Barnett has even denied
 knowledge of any gun regulation existing in the states at the passage of the
 Bill of Rights.9 This essay therefore examines a previously undeveloped
 topic, not as a definitive statement of a position but as a tentative explora-
 tion. And certainly a great deal of research lies ahead. It is one thing to find
 statute law, it is another to discover the level of its enforcement. It is cer-

 tainly possible that all the laws described here remained unfulfilled inten-
 tions. Yet it is my contention that the content and intent of these laws
 matched contemporary social values and that the early American legisla-
 tures shared the British perception that gun ownership should be precisely
 constrained by law.

 As Jacob Burkhardt said in the introduction to his seminal work, The

 Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy:

 In the wide ocean upon which we venture, the possible ways and directions
 are many; and the same studies which have served for this work might easi-
 ly, in other hands, not only receive a wholly different treatment and applica-
 tion, but lead also to essentially different conclusions. Such indeed is the
 importance of the subject that it still calls for fresh investigation, and may be
 studied with advantage from the most varied points of view. Meanwhile we
 are content if a patient hearing is granted us ... 10

 It is precisely this fundamental standard of history, the open allowance of
 alternative readings, that the "new consensus" seeks to foreclose. But our
 discussions are far from over.'1

 At the center of the evidence for the standard model's reading of British
 and American history is the English Bill of Rights of 1689. As Joyce Mal-
 colm has written, the authors of the Bill of Rights transformed "a custom-
 ary duty into a right" and established "the need for citizens to be armed to
 guarantee freedom" throughout the British Empire. The United States stood
 heir to these legal rights. In fact, it was this "right of individuals to be
 armed ... which Americans fought to protect in 1775." The new govern-
 ment then institutionalized the universal right to bear arms in the Consti-
 tution's Second Amendment.'2 This article suggests a slightly different
 reading of the primary sources.

 Article Seven of the Bill of Rights of 1689 states that "the Subjects,

 which are Protestants, may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their
 Conditions and as allowed by Law." Most readers may be struck, as was
 Blackstone, with the three qualifications in this "right": it is limited by
 religious belief, social condition, and the law. Within weeks of the com-
 pletion of the Bill of Rights, Parliament voted to disarm Catholics, declar-
 ing that they had no right to bear arms. Obviously this act was consistent
 with the Bill of Rights, as were later acts of Parliament reestablishing lev-
 els of property ownership as prerequisites for possessing different kinds
 of firearms, as well as the militia acts that granted the lords lieutenant the
 power to disarm anyone whenever they considered it necessary for public
 peace. To give just one further example, during the Parliamentary debate
 in 1691 over a new game act, an amendment was offered allowing Protes-
 tants to keep guns despite the traditional class-based prohibitions. This
 measure was defeated by a vote of 169 to 65. Sir John Lowther dismissed
 the proposal as seeking "to arm the mob, which I think is not very safe for
 any government." Only a specific, reliable group of subjects was allowed
 access to firearms. Gun ownership in Britain, as in British America at the
 same time, was a collective right, collectively denied.'3

 Law and History Review, Fall 1998

 The English Bill of Rights was entirely in keeping with earlier arms

 legislation, which sought to restrict access to all forms of weaponry. The
 first Parliamentary legislation on firearms, the 1541 militia act, sought to
 limit ownership of pistols and crossbows because they were easily con-
 cealed and therefore more likely to be used in the commission of a crime.
 Later legislation, most of which fell into the category of game or militia
 law, followed this model. Blackstone stated that the purpose of the game
 laws was the "prevention of popular insurrections and resistance to the
 government by disarming the bulk of the people." The game act of 1671,
 passed unanimously, gave gamekeepers the power to seize all weapons used
 in hunting, including guns, from those not eligible to hunt, which meant
 all but large property owners. The very possession of a gun carried a pre-
 sumption of the intent to poach in the eyes of the law. As Blackstone not-
 ed, under the game act, the right to hunt-and thus to own a gun without
 fear of its expropriation-required fifty times as much property as the right
 to vote. With this act, the government intended to get rid of guns; fines for
 illegal possession were moderate, but the law mandated the confiscation
 of all firearms employed in violation of the game law. Parliament sought
 its version of law and order, securing the peace of the realm by eliminat-
 ing as many weapons of violence as possible.14

 English gun laws shifted with the observer's perspective. Blackstone
 stated that an "auxiliary right of the subject, ... is that of having arms for
 their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed
 by law . . and is, indeed, a publick allowance under due restrictions, of
 the natural right of resistance and self preservation, when the sanctions of
 society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppres-
 sion." As with the Bill of Rights, what stands out are the qualifiers-so-
 cial status and legal restrictions-and the extraordinary conditions-"when
 the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the vio-
 lence of oppression."'5 Sometimes Parliament and the colonial governments
 worked to arm white adult male Protestant subjects, and at other times they
 worked to limit the spread and usage of arms. At all times, the legislatures

 ative, legal redress, petition, and "having arms for their defence." Ibid., 1:136-40.

 of England and English North America regulated arms production and trade
 and maintained strict guidelines of those allowed to bear arms. The bot-
 tom line was state control. Legislation regulating arms production, trade,
 and ownership actually increased after passage of the English Bill of Rights,
 and enforcement of these acts remained rigorous throughout the eighteenth

 century.16

 The contemporary evidence on every specific English firearms law pro-
 vides a basic underlying justification: fear. Some intellectuals most feared
 a standing army.17 The Commonwealthmen of the late seventeenth and early
 eighteenth centuries warned, in John Trenchard's words, that "unhappy
 nations have lost that precious jewell liberty" when "their necessities or
 indiscretion have permitted a standing army to be kept amongst them."
 Trenchard and most Commonwealthmen perceived an obvious conclusion:
 do not keep standing armies but rely on well-organized militia units for the
 nation's defense. The English government rejected such a wild-eyed no-
 tion, preferring to rely on their Regulars not just to defend the Empire but
 to expand it. Further, members of the English elite were justly concerned
 about the consequence of allowing members of the lower classes to believe
 themselves entitled to own a gun. In fact, the very idea that such a right
 existed met only mockery from the elite and their government.'8

 English common law formed the basis for American colonial legislation.
 From the very first codes of law passed in the Chesapeake and New En-
 gland colonies, gun ownership was carefully circumscribed. Possession of

 Law and History Review, Fall 1998

 firearms was not understood as a collective right but rather as a collective
 duty necessary to the defense of society, with that collectivity precisely
 defined and far from inclusive. Repeatedly, colonial legislatures passed laws
 requiring white Protestant adult male property holders to own guns as a
 support for the local militia. Just so there would be no misunderstanding,
 such laws forbade other groups from owning firearms. Only Protestants
 could own guns, and not always all Protestants; for instance in 1637 Mas-
 sachusetts disarmed the Antinomians. The prohibition on Catholics own-
 ing guns had been ignored in Maryland because of the heavy concentra-
 tion of Catholics there. But in 1756, with the start of the Seven Years' War,

 the Maryland assembly noted that anomaly, passing a law expropriating all
 the arms and ammunition of Catholics and mandating prison terms for any
 Catholic found concealing arms. Maryland's militia law did not allow
 Catholics, indentured servants, and slaves to bear arms. In contrast, any
 qualified individual who refused to serve in the militia forfeited any arms
 and ammunition he might own. The upshot, though, was that if one did not
 own a gun, one could avoid militia duty.19

 English settlers in America had more to fear than the class or religious
 distinctions that had disrupted England. Throughout the first two hundred
 years of English settlement in North America, the Indians resisted the con-
 quest of their lands. Not surprisingly, colonial gun laws continually sought
 to limit Indian access to firearms. On some occasions legislatures passed
 universal bans on Indians purchasing or carrying firearms. In 1619 the
 Virginia House of Burgesses passed an act that "no man do sell or give any
 Indians any piece of shott, or poulder, or any other armes offensive or de-
 fensive, upon paine of being held a traitor to the colony & of being hanged."
 This law was revised in 1653. But the French and Spanish governments,
 and even English merchants, consistently undermined these efforts to keep
 Indians unarmed. English reliance on Indian allies in their wars against
 hostile Indians and competing European powers further complicated mat-
 ters. As long as colonial governments acknowledged that there were "good
 Indians" deserving of guns, their efforts to maintain a technological advan-
 tage were in jeopardy.2

 Not that the colonial governments did not try to maintain a distinction.
 Time and again legislatures attempted to specify the fine line between
 friendly and hostile Indians in terms of the gun trade; one was encouraged,
 the other forbidden. Time and again, English merchants ignored this leg-
 islation. The one check the governments kept on Indian gun ownership was
 regulation of gun repair. Since guns were in short supply in North Ameri-
 ca, and since few people could repair firearms, a broken musket was good
 for little more than a clumsy club. The Westos of Virginia discovered the
 danger of excessive dependence on firearms in the early 1680s. The Vir-
 ginia government cut off their supply of powder and access to repairs and
 then chased the Westos out of their homelands. When colonial governments
 judged their Indian opponents too well armed, they regulated the repair of
 Indian firearms, an act easier to enforce than that on the sale of guns. Thus
 the government of South Carolina was able to keep a close account of
 Cherokee firearms by requiring that they all be repaired in Charleston, a
 process that took several months.21

 The Indian peril also affected regulations applying to the colonists. From
 their first settlement, the colonies required all freemen to own a gun in
 defense against external dangers. But few of these freemen could afford
 firearms, so it became necessary for governments to supply them, with laws
 passed to effect that purpose. At the same time, legislators feared that gun-
 toting freemen might, under special circumstances, pose a threat to the very
 polity they were supposed to defend. Colonial legislatures therefore strictly
 regulated the storage of firearms, with weapons kept in some central place
 to be produced only in emergencies or on muster day. Such legislation was
 on the books of colonies from New Hampshire to South Carolina.22

 Perception of two potential sources of internal danger underlay these
 efforts to regulate access to firearms. Initially, indentured servants consti-
 tuted the more dangerous of the two perceived threats. These unfree white
 laborers often had reason to resist the authority of the English elite, being

 exploited often unto death and having very little to lose by insurrection.
 Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 graphically demonstrated the hazard posed by
 allowing the poor some access to firearms. Most of the colonial legislatures
 learned from this Virginia uprising. For the rest of the colonial period they
 enhanced internal security by forbidding indentured servants to own or
 carry firearms.23

 In several of the colonies slaves and free blacks posed an even greater
 danger to the elite. An armed slave who knew how to use a firearm was
 the equal of any white. The solution appeared equally obvious: a complete
 prohibition of gun ownership strictly enforced. Every Southern colony leg-
 islated against the ownership of firearms by slaves. They also forbade the
 carrying of firearms by a slave except when under the direct command or
 supervision of his owner. From time to time these laws became rather lax,
 and favored slaves could be seen hunting with their masters. But legisla-
 tures tightened these laws immediately following a slave uprising such as
 South Carolina's Stono Rebellion of 1740. Such slave uprisings-real and
 imagined-persuaded colonial legislatures that blacks as a group, slave or
 free, should not be allowed to own firearms.24

 Local communities and colonial assemblies passed regulatory legisla-

 tion throughout the colonial period. As in Britain, American governments
 sought to regulate the quality, sale, and storage of firearms and munitions;
 the maintenance of arms used for public purposes; where, when, and by
 whom firearms could be carried and fired. Legislatures also granted offi-
 cials the right to expropriate firearms during internal or external crises and
 to conduct gun censuses. And, most important, legislatures followed the
 English example in denying the right to own guns to potentially danger-
 ous groups: blacks, slave and free; Indians; propertyless whites; non-Prot-
 estants or potentially unruly Protestants. These laws worked because the
 political community supported their enforcement, fearing the consequences
 of unregulated access to firearms and munitions.

 Many contemporary observers described different cultural attitudes to-
 ward firearms from one region of colonial North America to another. In the
 eighteenth century, New Englanders, even the wealthy with more time and
 resources to practice shooting, were generally described as terrible shots;
 but the Southern elite was closely associated with guns and their deadly
 use. William Blathwayt stated in 1691 "that there is no Custom more gen-
 erally to be observed among the Young Virginians than that they all Learn

 to keep and use a gun with a Marvelous dexterity as soon as ever they have
 strength enough to lift it to their heads." Yet there is much evidence that
 these perceived distinctions emerged from stereotype rather than observa-
 tion. Southerners, for instance, were held to be deadly shots in a duel, the

 preferred method of conflict resolution in the mid-eighteenth-century South.
 But recent research on dueling finds far more bloodshed in literature than
 on the field of honor. Probate records indicate that more white males owned

 firearms in the Chesapeake than anywhere else in colonial America or
 England, yet this number represented only a small proportion of the total
 population. And government records from 1634 through the onset of the
 Revolution reveal that there were never enough guns in the whole colony
 to arm those serving in the militia. If Blathwayt's description was accu-
 rate for 1691, Governor Robert Dinwiddie and Colonel George Washing-
 ton could find no indication that skill with firearms had survived among
 Virginians into the 1750s.25

 Despite possible regional cultural differences, we can trace the presence
 and administration of restrictions on gun ownership through the history of
 each English colony. Each colonial government was naturally responding
 to singular needs and challenges, so that one could easily craft thirteen
 different histories. Still, similarities persist. For brevity's sake, this essay
 focuses on two colonies with distinctively different social structures, Vir-
 ginia and Connecticut.

 Law and History Review, Fall 1998

 seventeenth century, no one in America north of the Rio Grande could make
 firearms, and since guns were far too expensive for most settlers to own,
 the government supplied pikes, swords, and muskets-but not long bows,
 which were considered a dangerously advanced weaponry for untrained
 commoners. Through most of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centu-
 ries, these weapons were stored in community arsenals or loaned to indi-

 viduals living in outlying areas, remaining the property of the government.26
 Virginia found its men a little too lax in their attitude toward carrying
 arms. Starting in 1623, laws were passed requiring persons traveling be-
 yond the safety of the settlements to go with "a sufficient partie well
 armed." Further, as a deterrent against Indians taking advantage of the
 English Sabbath, and to effect a more convenient inspection of the colo-
 ny's arms, the Burgesses proclaimed in 1631 that all men allowed to bear
 arms were to bring them to church.27 Given the shortage of firearms and
 gunpowder, the colony also forbade the use of firearms in connection with

 "drinkinge or enterteynments," a prohibition that was expanded in 1655 and
 continued in force through the rest of the century. In times of emergency,
 such as the Indian war of 1675, the colony stiffened the prohibition against
 frivolous shooting of a musket with the threat of the death penalty.28

 Some Virginians earned the ire of colonial officials by selling firearms
 and powder to the Indians, a practice the colony outlawed in 1633, with
 punishment set at the automatic loss of all property and imprisonment for
 life. Ten years later, as relations with the Indians again deteriorated to the
 point of war, the Burgesses amended the gun-trade law to also prohibit
 loaning or sharing arms or ammunition with Indians and teaching Indians
 to shoot. In 1659 the colony temporarily gave up trying to control the arms
 trade, since the Dutch were supplying the Indians with guns anyway. To
 compensate for this danger, though, the Burgesses required every free man
 to have a gun in his house or face a fine of fifty pounds of tobacco. Since

 the state offered to supply these weapons, the freemen faced no real cost
 unless they had a moral scruple against owning firearms. In 1665, with the
 Dutch expelled from the Hudson, Virginia reestablished a strict prohibition
 on the sale of arms to Indians. At the start of the Susquehanna War in 1675
 it mandated the death penalty for such trade. Even friendly Indians were
 subject to precise regulation on the use of arms. In 1705 the Burgesses
 decreed that any Indian, friendly or hostile, caught hunting on English-
 owned land would lose his firearms and ammunition. It was also illegal to

 employ Indians to hunt or to furnish them with arms and ammunition for
 this purpose.29

 In 1632 Virginia's governing body recognized that it faced an internal

 threat from the colony's indentured servants. The legislature tried to keep
 firearms out of the hands of servants, except in an emergency. To make clear
 the law's intent, any runaway servant caught carrying a firearm, powder,
 or shot to Indians was subject to the death penalty. Throughout the colo-
 nial period, indentured servants were not allowed to serve in the militia,
 an effective way of keeping muskets out of their hands while minimizing
 knowledge of the use of firearms.30

 In 1640 the Virginia Burgesses first recognized the inherent danger of
 slavery. In the midst of an Indian war, the government recommended that
 "all masters of families ... use their best endeavours for the firishing of
 themselves and all those... capable of arms (excepting negroes) with
 arms." For the next eighty years the colony grappled with precisely how
 to control its black population and whether to distinguish between enslaved
 and free blacks. In 1675 a county court clarified that a free black head-of-
 household could own a gun. But the very next year Nathaniel Bacon sup-
 plied arms to blacks who joined his forces. The legislature learned a valu-
 able lesson from this uprising and in 1680 prohibited "any negroe or other
 slave" from carrying guns or any other weapon, ordering the confiscation
 of the guns and whipping of the slave-a wording that may have allowed
 free blacks to possess firearms. Later the assembly granted exceptions for
 blacks living in frontier regions, but only after the free black or master
 obtained a license from a justice of the peace. In 1723 the legislature closed
 any loopholes in its laws with "An Act for the better government of Ne-
 groes, Mulattoes, and Indians." This law declared that "no negro, mulatto,
 or Indian whatsoever... shall hereafter presume to keep, or carry any gun,
 powder, shot, or any club, or other weapon whatsoever, offensive or de-
 fensive." The 1738 militia act further clarified this prohibition and ruled

 that free blacks could serve only "as drummers or trumpeters." Even after
 the Revolution, Virginia's legislature could not imagine the circumstances
 under which it was appropriate for a black American to own a gun; cer-
 tainly the enslaved should not possess guns. A 1785 act stated that "No
 slave shall keep any arms whatever nor pass unless with written orders from
 his master... with arms from one place to another. Arms in possession of
 a slave contrary to this prohibition shall be forfeited."3'

 These restrictions did not translate into the nonownership of firearms
 among all Virginians. Quite the contrary. The Virginia legislature encour-
 aged the private ownership of firearms by white male property owners, even
 placing such weapons in a special legal category (since privately owned
 guns could not be held subject to seizure in a civil suit). In the early eigh-
 teenth century the Burgesses tried threats instead, giving every member of
 the militia eighteen months to provide himself with a firearm or face a fine
 of one hundred pounds of tobacco. A 1727 act clarified that "the true in-
 tent and meaning of this act, [is] That for the pay and allowance given by
 this act" every soldier was expected to purchase arms and ammunition. The
 colony freed every member of the militia from responsibility for owning a
 firearm until such time that his pay, fifteen pounds of tobacco per day of
 service, was sufficient to buy a state-supplied musket. In effect, then, the
 colony was paying the militia to buy arms. Despite these efforts, the Bur-
 gesses still found it necessary in 1740 to vote ?2000 for the purchase of
 arms for the militia. In 1755 the assembly gave members of the militia
 another twelve months to acquire arms. Clearly the colony was having trou-

 ble getting its male subjects to bear arms, to the point that it exempted from
 militia duty anyone who would supply two to four "complete sets of arms,"
 depending on condition, for use by the militia. Thus the well armed could
 avoid service in the militia entirely.32

 Though the state supported and subsidized the private ownership of fire-

 arms, the colony reserved to itself the right to impress arms on any occa-
 sion, either as a defensive measure or for use by the state. No gun ever
 belonged unqualifiably to an individual. It could not be seized in a debt
 case, could not be sold if that sale left a militia member without a firearm,

 and could be seized whenever needed by the state for alternative purpos-

 es. As the Militia Act of 1785 stated, a gun provided to a member of the
 militia "shall continue the property of the county." It could not be sold by
 its holder and had to be returned if he moved out of the county or died.33
 The failure of all these efforts to arm the militia was evident in 1775. In

 the crisis of the Revolution the Virginia Burgesses discovered, as did the
 legislature of every one of the new states, that their militia was grossly
 under-armed or very poorly armed. The Defence Act of July 1775 man-
 dated that the state supply arms and ammunition to its militia. The state

 rushed to establish the first arms manufactory in the Chesapeake, at Fred-
 ericksburg, with a ?2,500 appropriation. This effort never came to fruition.

 In December 1775 the state offered a ten-shilling-per-year bonus to any mi-
 litiaman who could supply his own gun. Ultimately, Virginia, together with
 the rest of America, turned to Europe for its firearms, buying guns from
 France and the Netherlands, mostly on credit. In 1782 Virginia moved to
 reclaim the many hundreds of firearms it had supplied to the militia dur-
 ing the Revolution, with all guns to be returned to militia storage. The state
 continued to perceive it as a duty to supply arms to the militia, but with
 the notion that these arms, except on the frontier, were to be kept in some
 communal repository.34

 In Virginia in the seventeenth century, the militia's main duty was pro-
 tection of the new settlements from the external danger of Indian attack.
 But that concern was consistently matched against an equivalent fear of
 internal subversion, particularly from indentured servants and slaves as a

 class. In the eighteenth century the primary responsibility of the militia was
 not public defense but internal security. The state drew its slave patrols,
 charged with keeping the slaves under strict control, from the militia, an
 arrangement institutionalized in the 1726 militia act and maintained un-

 der the strictest state regulation with government-supplied arms until 1865.
 Until at least that latter date, guns were held in trust for the state, subject
 to the demands of the fears generated by racism.35

 Law and History Review, Fall 1998

 Initially, the story in Connecticut was strikingly similar to Virginia's. From
 its beginning, the General Assembly of Connecticut devoted its efforts to
 arming, supplying, and regulating its militia for defense against the Indi-
 ans. The Connecticut legislature, like Virginia's, required all appropriate
 white male adults to bear arms, while appreciating how improbable it was
 for them to fulfill that requirement. Thus the very first militia act, passed
 in 1637, expected all Protestant males above the age of sixteen to own a
 firearm, "except they doe tender a sufficient excuse." The same act made
 each town responsible for supplying firearms and munitions, from flints to

 powder to lead for balls.36 Every few years the General Court observed that
 the towns were negligent in this duty and passed some nominal fine to
 demonstrate its continued concern and control, always acknowledging their
 failure to meet the desired end of a well-armed militia.37

 The colony sought a number of expedients in supplying arms to its cit-
 izens. In 1648 it ordered that those who "cannott purchase them by such
 meanes as hee hath" shall bring "Corne or other merchantable goods" to
 the clerk of the General Court who would try to buy a gun for him. Alter-

 natively, the gunless individual could work for his town to earn a musket
 purchased by the town. In order to better portion out what they did have,
 the legislature instructed the towns to store their munitions, pikes, and
 firearms and to avoid giving any of these military necessities to individu-
 als. Not until 1741 did the legislature feel comfortable having the mem-
 bers of the militia keep "a firelock" in working condition in their houses.
 But in 1747 the assembly reversed direction and again decided to store the
 militia's arms in a central repository in each town. So insistent was the
 General Court that munitions not be left in private hands that in 1749 and

 again in 1750 it demanded the retrieval of one cask of gunpowder left in a
 private home. With arms and ammunition so scarce and vital to the colo-
 ny's security, individual subjects could not be trusted to properly care for
 either.38

 All the colonies discovered, sooner or later, the insufficiency of requiring

 freemen to own firearms and even the limitations of attempting to provide

 those guns. For firearms, made of iron, rusted and decayed quickly if not
 carefully serviced. In 1656 Connecticut, like so many other colonies, grant-
 ed the clerk of each militia company the authority "to examin & censure all
 defects of armes" and to require repairs. The colony found these directions
 frustrated, however, by the paucity of trained gunsmiths. In response, the

 government granted local officials the power to impress the labor of anyone

 and powder and to prescribe the necessary repairs. These muster-masters not
 only could compel the labor of anyone discovered to have a knowledge of
 firearms but also had the authority to seize property to pay for repairs or to
 impress any firearms needed for the community's defense and to command
 towns to purchase more firearms, if they could find any for sale.40

 The Connecticut assembly did not trust its citizens to take pride in their
 possession of firearms nor to demonstrate sufficient enthusiasm for the
 militia ideal by actually holding regular musters. In 1724 the legislature
 ordered that the annual general inspection of all arms, public and private,
 "be held on one and the same day, to prevent deceit." It further instructed,
 yet again, that the towns were to see that all defective weapons were re-
 paired immediately. Such insistence on annual inspections of firearms con-
 tinued through the colonial period, as did efforts by the colonial govern-
 ments to repair firearms. In 1756 the legislature noted that, though the law
 required every householder to keep arms and ammunition, "yet for want
 of a due obedience thereto the true intention" of the act "is greatly frus-
 trated." The assembly therefore ordered a second inspection of arms and
 ammunition, with stiffer fines for noncompliance, while granting com-
 manding colonels greater authority to ensure the care of militia arms.41
 Like other English colonies, Connecticut relied on the Crown to supply
 firearms, which officials then distributed among the towns-though there
 were still never enough. In 1675 the General Court reported that most
 militia members did not have access to guns and therefore ordered the cre-
 ation of "foot companies" bearing pikes. Given that shortage of firearms
 and munitions, the General Court outlawed firing a gun except in defense
 and selling or spoiling arms that might be required for communal use.42 In
 1756 the General Court reported that the Connecticut militia was danger-
 ously under-armed and that there were no arms nor ammunition available
 for sale in Connecticut or the neighboring colonies. No surplus of arms
 existed in the northern colonies. Facing war with France and its Indian
 allies, the General Court frantically turned to the Crown for aid, finally

 persuading the British army to supply two thousand muskets for the use
 of the militia. William Pitt promised, and delivered, the arms but enjoined
 the governor to impress "all the serviceable arms that can be found within
 your Govt."43

 As in Virginia, the political leadership of Connecticut feared Indian fa-
 miliarity with firearms. In 1642 the legislature decreed that no one "shall
 directly or indirectly amend, repaire, or cause to be amended or repaired,
 any gun, smale or greate, belonging to any Indean," nor sell, barter, or give
 any kind of gun, shot, or powder. But it went even further in insisting that
 Indians not be allowed to "medle with or handle any Englishemans weap-
 ens of any sort," apparently in hopes that the Indians would somehow re-
 main ignorant of the use of firearms. The legislature, discovering that In-
 dians were acquiring guns anyway-primarily, but not solely, from Dutch
 and French traders-commanded in 1653 that all Indians must deliver up
 all their firearms and forbade their bearing them in the future. Any who
 refused or attempted to flee were to be shot. The General Court authorized
 freemen to seize firearms from Indians, promising a reward for doing so.44
 Each colony tried to control the Indian gun trade, each in turn detected
 someone from a different colony selling arms to Indians within their
 bounds. Thus in 1669 the Connecticut General Court complained that Ply-
 mouth and Massachusetts merchants were selling arms and ammunition to
 Indians in Connecticut. Holding that their citizens should not lose the eco-
 nomic benefit of this trade, the assembly allowed each town to appoint one
 person who could sell firearms to the Indians but under the strictest regu-
 lation. Firearms could only be sold if the town held a surplus above the
 needs of the local militia. Since no town did so in the seventeenth century,

 any guns sold to the Indians violated the law. This experiment lasted only
 six years, for in 1675 the General Court decreed a complete end to the sale
 of arms and ammunition to Indians, with violators jailed for one year and
 "severly whipt at his entrance and once a quarter" while in jail.45

 In 1690 the Connecticut assembly spoke for the first time on the racial
 dimension of gun ownership, though it may have just been institutionaliz-
 ing common practice. As subjects without civic rights, Negroes and Indi-
 ans, even Christian Indians, were excluded from the militia laws, essen-
 tially cutting both off from a legal right to own firearms. In 1708 the
 assembly simplified this prohibition, at least for Indians, by forbidding sell-

 ing, lending, or giving "to any of our friend Indian or Indians, any gun, for
 any time." Any such gun would be expropriated. The assembly denied In-
 dians, hostile or friendly, access to firearms as the entire race was not to
 be trusted with guns.46

 Given the manner in which fear drove these strenuous and repeated ef-
 forts at gun regulation, it is significant that Connecticut abandoned those
 endeavors in May 1763. With the end of the Seven Years' War, guns, for
 the first time, became scattered throughout the colony. The General Assem-
 bly ordered the deputies in every town to impound and then sell guns be-
 longing to Connecticut, including those acquired from the Crown, which
 wanted them back. With so many guns in circulation, and with both the
 French and Indian threat removed, it just no longer mattered to the legis-
 lature if the citizenry owned and maintained firearms. The following year
 the legislature ended all muster inspections and exempted those who did
 not own or want to own guns from the militia. Lacking the internal threat
 present in Virginia, the legislature of Connecticut reasoned that the colo-
 ny had no further need for a well-armed militia. Or so they thought in
 1764.47

 The imperial crisis of 1774 changed the minds of Connecticut's politi-
 cal leaders. In October the legislature suddenly reversed direction and fran-
 tically began searching for guns with which to rearm their militia, while
 offering subsidies, as in Virginia, for the manufacture of guns and gunlocks.
 Confronted by a new external threat, the British army, Connecticut's gov-
 ernment searched everywhere for arms and ammunition, directing a thor-
 ough examination of old warehouses and basements where munitions had
 once been stored in hopes of finding the stray barrel or musket or even a
 blunderbuss the province might have forgotten or left in someone's custo-
 dy. By April 1775 Connecticut offered a ten-shilling bonus to anyone sup-
 plying his own gun for militia use, with a guarantee of full reimbursement
 should the gun be lost. Adding the stick to that carrot, the legislature au-
 thorized militia officers to impress any guns not offered up for service.
 Connecticut, like every other state during the Revolution, felt not the slight-
 est qualm in impressing firearms as needed and seizing those belonging to
 loyalists. The citizens of Connecticut held their guns in trust for the state,
 subject to the erratic fear of external dangers.48

 Law and History Review, Fall 1998

 Starting from the same legal roots, Virginia and Connecticut moved in dif-
 ferent, though not contradictory, directions. The government's authority over
 firearms remained uncontested in legal venues during the colonial period.
 Perceived dangers, while distinctive by region, were simply too great and
 resources too limited for legislatures to render primacy to individual rights.
 Firearms were held at sufferance, the state reserving the right to limit, reg-
 ulate, or impress those arms at its discretion. Under common law this "re-
 served right of the sovereign" differed from eminent domain. It lacked a re-
 quirement for just compensation, since firearms were always seen as in the
 service of the monarch, and it did not need a special act of Parliament.49 For-
 rest McDonald has noted that the "American legislatures had been less
 squeamish about invading property rights" than Parliament.50 The Ameri-
 can Revolution certainly did not change that English heritage, as the loyal-
 ists discovered when their firearms were confiscated.51 Nor is it clear that

 the Second Amendment altered that formulation, as those denied guns be-
 cause of race, religion, or ethnicity in the new republic could affirm.

 State legislatures needed no further argument than public safety, or in
 Constitutional terms, the state's police powers, to justify gun regulation.
 In this regard they adhered to the English common law heritage and the
 practice of every European nation. As Edmund Burke held, the state's pri-
 mary justification is, after all, public safety, and therefore the legislature
 has a legitimate interest in passing acts to secure that end. And it is amaz-
 ing how little debate these measures aroused-other than accusations that
 they were not stringent enough or rigorously enforced.52

 Some scholars have argued that the primacy of internal security gave way
 to libertarian values with the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1791. This
 conclusion is based on a careful reading of the language and philosophy
 of the framers of the Constitution. Certainly, the question of original in-
 tent has recently been keenly debated by some of the sharpest legal schol-
 ars in America. It is fair to say that there is no resolution in sight.53 None-
 theless, if one values original intent in constitutional questions, then three
 possible sources of interpretation are available: the exact wording of the
 constitutional text; the debates of the framers and their opponents; and
 legislation immediately preceding and following adoption of the passage
 in question. This article focuses only on the last form of evaluation. It as-
 sumes that a pattern of legislative enactment tells us more about intentions
 than does competing parsing of the Second Amendment's single sentence.54
 Every state had gun control legislation on its books at the time the Sec-
 ond Amendment was approved. Every state continued to pass such legis-
 lation after the Second Amendment became the law of the land, and they

 were joined in such regulatory efforts by the federal government, starting
 with the first national militia act of 1792. On the one occasion when such

 legislation was overturned, in Bliss v. Commonwealth (1822), the Kentucky
 Supreme Court ruled that state regulation of firearms violated the state's
 militia amendment, which granted an explicitly individual right to bear
 arms. In response, the legislature immediately amended the state constitu-
 tion to allow such legislation, rewriting the militia amendment to more
 closely match the federal Constitution's Second Amendment. Otherwise,
 court after court agreed with the logic of Tennessee's high court in Aymette
 v. State (1840) that "The single individual ... is not spoken of or thought
 of as 'bearing arms.'"55

 Some scholars have traced the development of an abiding concern for

 individual liberty to its culmination in the Second Amendment. An alter-

 native reading of the evidence suggests a history of gun regulation born of
 fear. In the context of fear and the perceived need of the framers of the

 Constitution to preserve social order, the Second Amendment may be seen
 both as a political gesture to placate the antifederalists and as an effort to
 regulate the militia as the best surety against dangerous social upheavals
 like Shays's Rebellion and slave uprisings.56

 Madison's speech in the House of Representatives, introducing his pro-
 posed amendments, supports such a reading. As is well known, Madison
 feared tyranny from the people and the repressive acts of state governments
 far more than he did the central government. As he told the House that day
 in 1789:

 In our government it is, perhaps, less necessary to guard against the abuse in
 the executive department than any other, because it is not the stronger branch
 of the system, but the weaker.... But... the great danger lies rather in the abuse

 of the community than in the legislative body. The prescriptions in favor of lib-
 erty, ought to be levelled against that quarter where the greatest danger lies,
 namely, that which possesses the highest prerogative of power: But this [is] not

 found in either the executive or legislative departments of government, but in

 the body of the people, operating by the majority against the minority.57

 It was an unrestrained citizenry who were to be most feared, and the Bill of
 Rights should operate to protect liberty against their transgressions. In the
 context of Madison's stated intentions, it is highly significant that, in every
 version of what became the Bill of Rights, only one amendment contained
 a preamble stating its purpose: what would become the Second Amendment.

 That purpose, as it was finally worded, was that "a well regulated militia" is
 "necessary to the security of a free State." The militia would therefore oper-
 ate as a check against the excesses of the public-precisely its historic use,
 from putting down slave rebellions to crushing labor unions.58

 Two competing attitudes toward the public nature of firearms ownership
 in early America are evident: the encouragement of male citizens to bear
 arms, and the state's right to regulate who could bear arms and when. Much
 legislation fostered the first while delimiting the latter. Either way, gun
 ownership was a public policy issue in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
 turies, not an inalienable and untouchable natural right. Probably the con-
 gressmen who framed and approved the Bill of Rights would have been
 astounded by the argument that gun rights are purely individual; all of them
 came from states in which the right to own guns was collectively granted
 to law-abiding white adult Protestant males. States and communities had
 the authority and responsibility to deny gun possession to those perceived
 as a threat to social stability, a standard that shifted over time to include
 nonwhites, workers, the foreign born, and criminals.

 The framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights created a theoretical
 structure of freedoms that they never intended for universal application.
 They did not, for instance, intend the suffrage to extend beyond the circle
 of white male property owners; and slaves could not be expected to enjoy
 freedom of speech and assembly. Gun ownership was one of these limited
 rights; and every state in the union sought to limit the extent of that priv-
 ilege. As states and the federal government reluctantly extended other rights
 to an ever growing percentage of the American public, so has the ability
 to arm oneself expanded to an ever greater portion of the population, within
 limitations established by the state. By the twentieth century almost every
 adult operated under the same limitations of Second Amendment rights,
 though the right of the state to establish restrictions has never been disputed
 by the courts. The distinction is that where once specific classes of people
 could be identified as posing a danger to society, now anyone and every-
 one, from a small child to a spouse, can be a source of armed terror. As
 the right to bear arms has been universalized, so has the fear.

 eral Congress (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991), 266-68. The brief debate
 in the House on this amendment focused on two issues: the "use of the militia" in prevent-
 ing "the establishment of a standing army"; and the wisdom of allowing religious exemp-
 tions for service in the militia. Ibid., 182-84, 198-99. See also ibid., 4, 30, 37-41, 48, 247-
