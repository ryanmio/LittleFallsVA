 THE INVASION OF VIRGINIA

 Indians, Colonialism, and the Conquest of Cant:

 A Review Essay on Anglo-Indian Relations in the

 Chesapeake

 by J. Frederick Fausz*

 It frequently happens that the historian, though he professes more humanity than
 the trapper, mountain man, or gold-digger, who shoots [an Indian] as a wild beast,

 really exhibits and practices a similar inhumanity to him, wielding a pen instead of
 a rifle. ?Henry David Thoreau, 1843

 At West Point, Virginia, modern motorists are overwhelmed by the sight
 and smell of a large papermaking plant as they cross the headwaters of the
 York River. Few of them realize that these lands at the confluence of the

 Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers contained one of the most significant
 Indian village complexes along the Atlantic coast when Euro-Americans
 first arrived in Tidewater Virginia. Here, where Opechancanough and
 his Pamunkey kinsmen once held sway with impressive powers and an
 extensive population, whole forests are now transformed into the paper
 that enables contemporary scholars to shape our historical conscious-
 ness?encouraging us to remember or allowing us to forget Opechanca-
 nough and his people as the national mood dictates.

 Only a decade ago, Francis Jennings provoked the consciousness and

 pricked the conscience of historians when he reminded us that the
 Europeans' "invasion of America0 in the colonial centuries was accom-
 panied by a "cant of conquest"?the war of words with which the literate

 victors justified the demographic disasters and cultural catastrophes that
 had ravaged indigenous populations in the East. His often fierce attack on
 those who defeated, dispossessed, and demeaned the Indians in the
 process of defining and defending America's mainstream national char-

 acter helped redirect the emphasis of historical writing from the victories
 to the victims of the Euro-American juggernaut.1

 In the decade since Jennings's Invasion of America appeared, a
 refreshing, revisionist historiography of Anglo-Indian relations has
 emerged to challenge old assumptions and to stimulate new perspectives
 on interethnic contacts, both past and present. The interdisciplinary,
 ethnohistorical research of recent years has successfully campaigned
 against the mythopoeic cant of conquest and encouraged a sensitive
 appreciation for the Indians' substantial contributions to the making of
 America.

 Both the significance of these new interpretations and their unfamil-
 iarity to general readers prompt this review of selected, representative
 works treating the major themes and chronological watersheds of the past
 four centuries. The focus throughout this essay is on intercultural
 relations, and I have generally excluded archaeological and ethnograph-
 ical studies not concerned with the dynamics of contact, as well as
 intellectual histories concerned more with the image of "the Indian" than
 with actual relations between peoples. Throughout the essay, I have
 interpreted the new trends in Virginia ethnohistoriography within the
 context of a more broadly conceived Chesapeake region (including North
 Carolina and Maryland) and have related that literature to relevant
 recent scholarship in other areas.2

 Ethnohistory: Mindset, Mood, and Methodology

 In historiography as in life, Virginia's Indians have been inextricably
 bound to the Anglo-Americans who altered their existence. When
 colonial American history emerged as an influential field of study in the
 1940s and 1950s, leading scholars soon recognized that Anglo-Indian
 relations constituted a central component of early English expansion that
 should not and could not be ignored. In 1952 Bernard DeVoto expressed

 is an intentional take-off on Jennings's title.

 dismay that "most American history has been written as if history were
 a function solely of white culture?in spite of the fact that till well into
 the nineteenth century the Indians were one of the principal determi-
 nants of historical events." In 1949 Wesley Frank Craven, who had
 already published an article on Virginia Indian policy early in his long and
 distinguished career, similarly bemoaned "the fact that few historians
 have managed to convey a feeling for the full extent to which the Indian
 problem absorbed the energies and thought of the colonists." In 1957
 Lester Cappon went further, suggesting that scholars should focus on
 Indians not as a "problem," but as contributors to events in broader, less
 pejorative, and more intellectually rewarding contexts. He was one of the
 first traditionally trained historians to appreciate and advocate cross-fer-
 tilization between anthropological and historical research in order to
 "illuminate not merely the Indian in terms of white society or the Indian
 in terms of his own society, but each in his own terms and in terms of the
 other."3

 Cappon's desire to see historians "encompass both self-knowledge and
 knowledge of others" by means of interdisciplinary approaches to
 interethnic relations was more easily expressed than realized, however.
 Historians lagged behind anthropologists?who founded the journal
 Ethnohistory in 1954 and often employed historical perspectives and data

 in their work?because they received little or no formal training in how
 to appreciate, assess, or analyze non-Western, preliterate, native cui-

 Opportunities for Study, Institute of Early American History and Culture (Chapel Hill, 1957), p. vii. In a 1979
 review essay on Chesapeake historiography, Thad W. Tate found only a handful of works on Anglo-Indian
 relations worth mentioning but noted that ongoing research was "beginning to exhibit less interest in
 questions of public policy toward the Indians than in the significance of intercultural contacts between
 Indians and whites" ("The Seventeenth-Century Chesapeake and Its Modern Historians," in Thad W. Tate

 published his "Indian Policy in Early Virginia" in the first volume of the new William and Mary Quarterly (3d
 ser., I [1944], 65-82; hereafter cited as WMQ), establishing the preeminence of that journal in the field of
 colonial Anglo-Indian relations that it has held ever since. The Institute of Early American History and
 Culture, Williamsburg, which publishes the WMQ, has influenced Indian studies as well through its support
 of visiting scholars and young postdoctoral fellows. Among the earliest fellows there were Wilcomb E.
 Washburn?who has ably advanced ethnohistory through publications such as Red Mans Land/White Mans
 Law: A Study of the Past and Present Status of the American Indian (New York, 1971) and The Indian in America,
 New American Nation Series (New York, 1975)?and Lawrence Towner?who, as director of Chicago's
 Newberry Library, helped establish in 1972 the important D'Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the
 American Indian at that institution. In the past few years, colonial ethnohistorians such as James Axtell,
 Francis Jennings, James Merrell, Daniel Richter, Bernard W. Sheehan, and I have benefited immeasurably
 from close association with both the institute and the center.

 tures. With the traditional cant of conquest still looming large in a
 postwar world, those few historians who emerged from Ph.D. programs
 in the late 1950s and early 1960s with an interest in and sensitivity to the
 "Indian side" of early cultural frontiers seem to have done so in spite of
 their graduate school mentors. Samuel Eliot Morison of Harvard Uni-
 versity, who trained or otherwise influenced several current historians of
 Virginia's interethnic relations, in 1958 described a seventeenth-century
 Anglo-Indian war as a "clash of a relatively advanced race with sav-
 ages"?similar to "the many instances today of backward peoples getting
 enlarged notions of nationalism and turning ferociously on Europeans
 who have attempted to civilize them."4

 Despite, or because of, the persistent influence of the cant-of-conquest
 perspective that led to such blatant Eurocentrism, a new generation of
 historians altered its views of the past when confronted with the critical,
 challenging realities of a changing world in the 1960s and 1970s. The
 civil rights movement in the United States redirected the national
 attention to the racial and cultural diversity that had evolved from our
 earliest beginnings and encouraged historians to ask new questions about
 America's pluralistic origins with more sensitivity to minority concerns.
 Simultaneously, American military intervention in Southeast Asia pro-
 voked serious debate and searing dissent that produced fresh insights into
 age-old discriminatory relationships between European colonizers and
 exploited native peoples.

 As America was thus tested and traumatized by national and global

 tremors of change, scholars reexamined and revised previously unchal-
 lenged assumptions about intercultural relations that had formed the
 cornerstone of the cant of conquest over several centuries. Although few
 historians consciously tried to remodel the tortured past in the image of
 the troubled present, interpretations of historical Anglo-Indian and
 white-black relations markedly corresponded to current trends in na-
 tional politics. The early era of civil rights and antiwar protests called

 4 Samuel Eliot Morison, "Introduction," in Douglas Edward Leach, Flintlock and Tomahawk: New Enghnd
 in King Philips War (1958; New York, 1966), p. ix. The huge methodological advantage that anthropologists
 had over historians is demonstrated by Nancy Oestreich Lurie's classic 1957 essay of enduring insightfulness,
 "Indian Cultural Adjustment to European Civilization," in James Morton Smith, ed., Seventeenth-Century
 America: Essays in Colonial History, Institute of Early American History and Culture (Chapel Hill, 1959), pp.
 33-60. Even many years later, historians rarely match the brilliant succinctness of Lurie's anthropological
 perceptiveness. Even though Wesley Frank Craven was more receptive to new approaches in interethnic
 relations than most political historians of his generation, the essay on Indians in his White, Red, and Black:
 The Seventeenth-Century Virginian (1971; New York, 1977), pp. 39-72, was pedestrian and simplistic
 compared to Lurie's analysis. See J. Frederick Fausz, "The 'Barbarous Massacre' Reconsidered: The
 Powhatan Uprising of 1622 and the Historians," Explorations in Ethnic Studies, I (Jan. 1978), 16-36.

 forth a "Wounded Knee" or "Uncle Tom" perspective of victimized
 minorities and evoked the sympathy and support of many in the dominant
 white society who were now suddenly outraged by their previous
 complacency with exploitation. When more vocal and violent protests
 dominated the media in the late 1960s and early 1970s, historians
 supplied precedents through the "Patriot Chiefs" or "Nat Turner"
 perspective of rebellious minorities that had aggressively sought social
 justice. Although portions of both perspectives continue to influence
 historical interpretations, more sophisticated and balanced treatments of
 interethnic relations have dominated in the less confrontational, less

 conflict-ridden period in national affairs since 1975.

 Disavowing the capricious presentism that marred earlier accounts,

 scholars of the past decade, less concerned with politicization, have
 emphasized the complex process of multicultural interaction in order to
 demonstrate how minorities adjusted to contacts with intruding, domi-
 nant groups without assimilating and how these minorities reciprocally
 influenced the mainstream culture over time. In his illuminating and
 iconoclastic Invasion of America, Jennings in 1975 described the concep-
 tual benefits of this ethnohistorical approach: "Instead of assuming an
 impassable chasm between [immigrant European and indigenous Indian]
 societies, the ethnohistorian postulates their capacity to exchange cul-
 tural traits in processes of cooperation as well as conflict, and he sets
 himself the task of describing those processes, to which he gives the
 inclusive neutral name of acculturation/' Merging the interests and
 insights of anthropologists, with their traditional disciplinary commit-
 ment to fieldwork among nonliterate native peoples, and historians, with
 their experience in the written sources of Western cultures, ethnohistory
 has provided a methodological meeting ground for the comprehensive
 analysis of multicultural interaction and reciprocal change between
 colonizing and colonized peoples in early America.5

 mushroomed in recent years. See especially James Axtell, "The Ethnohistory of Early America: A Review

 In terms of the conquest of cant?discarding the distorted rhetoric of
 rigid (and mythical) "frontiers" between "civilized" and "savage" peoples
 in favor of more enlightening perspectives on mutual acculturation?the
 mid-1970s produced a breakthrough. Joining The Invasion of America in
 disseminating fresh approaches were five books on early Anglo-Indian
 relations published within a year either side of 1975. Three of them?
 Gary B. Nash's Red, White, and Black: The Peoples of Early America
 (1974), Edmund S. Morgan's American Slavery, American Freedom: The
 Ordeal of Colonial Virginia (1975), and anthropologist Charles Hudson's
 magnificent overview of The Southeastern Indians (1976)?are particularly
 noteworthy in the context of this review essay, because their focus
 encouraged renewed scholarly interest in analyzing complex cultural
 contacts and triracial relations that had their origins in the colonial
 Chesapeake. Although as yet there has been no book on Chesapeake
 ethnohistory to compare with the excellence of the new northern studies,
 such as Neal Salisbury's insightful Manitou and Providence: Indians,
 Europeans, and the Making of New England, 1500-1643 (1982) or James
 Axtell's pathbreaking Invasion Within: The Contest of Cultures in Colonial
 North America (1985), the output of recent dissertations and journal
 articles has signaled an unprecedentedly strong interest in Anglo-Indian
 relations in the colonial South.6

 Ethnohistory, XV (1968), 203-35, and Howard L?mar and Leonard Thompson, eds., The Frontier in History:

 The Metaphysics of Indian-Hating and Empire-Building (Minneapolis, 1980), which provocatively traced
 Euro-American expansionism and racism from the early Puritans in Massachusetts to the CIA in Vietnam,
 was most obviously influenced by trends in contemporary affairs. The growing influence of the Third World
 in recent years similarly encouraged Eric R. Wolf, Europe and the People Without History (Berkeley and
 London, 1982), to offer a fresh multidisciplinary interpretation of native peoples and the West over six
 centuries of global contacts. Michael Zuckerman pointed to a reactionary consequence of the present
 intruding upon the past when he recently observed, "The Indians ought to be crucial to our history, and
 especially to our early history, as exemplars of . . . alternative lifeways and of the incapacity of any single
 culture to command the continent. . . . But exactly on that account, the instance of the Indians must be
 disdained, or denied. In a nation obsessed with the Cold War and indifferent to irony, we can only apprehend
 the Indians as un-American" ("Comment on Neal Salisbury's 'Indians in Colonial History,' " D'Arcy

 Anglo-Indian Relations in the Chesapeake 139

 Such ethnohistorical revisionism now has the potential to make
 significant contributions to the ongoing and more generalized revitaliza-
 tion of Chesapeake historiography that has in the past decade given a
 renewed prominence to colonial Virginia, but much remains to be done
 before Indians are fully and accurately portrayed as indispensable
 contributors to the history of the Old Dominion. Although both scholarly
 research and public awareness have been enhanced by commemorations
 of the colonial Chesapeake?the three hundred fiftieth anniversaries of
 Virginia and Maryland in 1957 and 1984, respectively, and North
 Carolina's celebration of the four hundredth anniversary of the Roanoke
 ventures (1984-90)?there is an attendant danger in popularizing the
 colonists' triumphs through expensive replicas of their ships while
 ignoring the negative realities of cultural subjugation and racial slavery
 that perpetuated the settlers' existence in this land.

 Although state anniversaries and national bicentennials can be ex-

 pected to celebrate distorted versions of the past, historical scholarship
 should be judged by stricter standards. Recent political and social
 histories of the colonial Chesapeake, although innovative and valuable in
 other ways, continue to be narrowly Anglocentric and woefully deficient
 in the quantity and quality of information they include on Indians.
 Despite championing a broader, holistic view of social processes to
 replace the filiopietistic obsession with the "Great White Fathers," some
 of the Chesapeake's most accomplished historians remain oblivious to the
 full potential of multiethnic perspectives. In fairness to past as well as
 future generations, researchers and readers of all persuasions should
 regard as equally fallacious both the exclusion of Indians from "main-
 stream history" and the segregation of "Indian history" as a discreet,
 detached, and somewhat whimsical footnote to the Anglo-American
 experience.7

 revised key areas of early American history by thoroughly integrating multiethnic perspectives from several
 disciplines. Of projected new works, see especially Peter H. Wood, Gregory Waselkov, and Tom Hatley, eds.,
 Powhatan's Manth: Essays on Indians of the Southeast (Lincoln, Nebr., forthcoming).

 7 Two recent surveys of Chesapeake colonies?Warren M. Billings, John E. Selby, and Thad W. Tate,
 Colonial Virginia: A History (White Plains, N.Y., 1986), and Aubrey C. Land, Colonial Maryhnd: A History
 (Millwood, N.Y., 1981), both in the KTO Press History of the American Colonies in Thirteen Volumes
 series, ed. Milton M. Klein and Jacob E. Cooke?remain as woefully inadequate on the subject of Indians as
 political histories published a generation ago. The new social histories of the region have been equally myopic,
 giving the impression that changes in colonial economics and demographics occurred in a land without a
 significant and influential Indian population. For the obvious omission, see Anita H. Rutman, "Still Planting
 the Seeds of Hope: The Recent Literature of the Early Chesapeake Region," Virginia Magazine of History and

 The Meeting of Two Worlds

 The first half-century of English colonization along the mid-Atlantic
 coast produced a record of increasingly antagonistic relations with
 Indians as settlement advanced northward over time from Roanoke in the

 1580s to Jamestown in the 1600s, until, with the founding of Maryland
 in 1634, a degree of intercultural accommodation and mutual toleration
 emerged in the northern Chesapeake. Each zone of Anglo-Algonquian
 contact exerted a powerful influence over the area that succeeded it. The
 initial optimism and ultimate disappointment surrounding the Roanoke
 enterprise bequeathed an ambiguous, ambivalent legacy to the Jamestown
 colonists, making them hopeful of Indian hospitality in theory but wary
 of Indian hostility in practice. The alternatingly promising and punishing
 relations between the colonists and the Powhatans in Tidewater Virginia
 before 1632 served as a catalyst for the cooperation that Marylanders
 enjoyed with their nearest native neighbors after 1634. In contrast to the
 impression imparted by textbook summaries, there was little indication
 that these struggling colonial outposts, so dependent on the Indians for
 their survival in their early years, would so quickly evolve into expansive,
 aggressive societies and displace the indigenous populations through a
 merger of Old World prejudice and New World prosperity.8

 From the winter of 1585?86, when a contingent of Roanoke colonists
 lived with Indians along the James River and found the Chesapeake Bay
 to be an ideal settlement site, the histories of Roanoke and Jamestown, of
 lost colonies and missed opportunities, became forever intertwined. The
 all-too-brief period of cordial exchanges and hopeful expectations be-
 tween Roanoke colonists and Carolina Algonquians was recorded in the
 memorable words of scientist Thomas Harriot and in the beautiful

 watercolors of artist John White. In 1984 Paul Hulton's America 1585:
 The Complete Drawings of John White brought these invaluable sources of
 mid-Atlantic contact history together for the first time in a widely
 available and affordable volume of accurately reproduced plates.9

 History of the Early Modern Era (Baltimore and London, 1984), pp. 195-232, insightfully demonstrate the
 potential for integrating Indians into a true multicultural social history of early America.

 Anglo-Indian Relations in the Chesapeake 141

 White's depictions and Harriot's descriptions of "the nature and
 manners of the naturall inhabitants" of the Carolina coast ("Ould
 Virginia") revealed the fashionable English fascination with environmen-
 tal primitivism and cultural evolution, and the two Englishmen were
 anxious "to showe how ... the [ancient tribal peoples] of the great
 Bretannie have bin in times past as sauvage as those of Virginia."10
 Ironically, the mutual curiosity between natives and newcomers at
 Roanoke proved to be literally and tragically infectious for the coastal
 Algonquians, because the very contacts that gave White and Harriot the
 opportunity to observe and appreciate their unique cultures destroyed the
 Indians' lives and altered their lifeways forever.

 The calamitous mortality of immunologically defenseless Indians
 infected by the "invisible bullets" of European diseases has aroused the
 curiosity of Anglo-American scholars since Harriot's time and has
 culminated in many recent ethnohistorical interpretations of the "virgin
 soil" epidemics or pandemics that regularly ravaged Native American
 populations of each successive contact era. The magnitude of the
 demographic disaster that transformed the "Columbian exchange" of
 transatlantic peoples and products into a veritable holocaust continues to
 be a hotly debated issue with important ideological implications. The
 older, low estimates of the precontact Native American population?with
 as few as 900,000 being assigned to the continent north of the Rio Grande
 in 1492?supported the traditional view of America as the nearly empty
 "virgin land" and European colonization as the great and glorious
 enterprise that populated and tamed the "wilderness." More recently,
 however, such scholars as Jennings and Henry F. Dobyns have advanced
 convincing, and sobering, arguments that emphasize the huge precontact
 populations that thrived on the continent in 1492 and interpret European
 colonization as a demographic disaster that destroyed millions of Native
 Americans, primarily through the unwitting transfer of lethal diseases to
 this hemisphere.11

 Dobyns (Their Number Become Thinned [1983]) projected a precontact
 population of eighteen million for America north of Mexico?two million
 of them horticulturists living in the Atlantic coastal plain from Florida
 to Massachusetts. Christian F. Feest focused studies on the mid-Atlantic
 region from North Carolina to Maryland and estimated Tidewater
 Algonquian populations of 7,000 for North Carolina in 1585, some
 14,000 to 22,000 for Virginia in 1607, and 12,000 for Maryland about
 1634. The complex issue of Indian demography has stimulated Dobyns to
 reconstruct the early ecosystem of Florida's native maize farmers in order

 to demonstrate the rich subsistence capabilities that could have supported
 large populations in ancient America. This study, contained in Their
 Number Become Thinned, should stimulate extensive research on similar

 Indian farming-fishing-and-hunting environments such as coastal Vir-
 ginia. In another approach to the problem, Douglas H. Ubelaker's
 archaeological analysis of Indian skeletons from Algonquian ossuaries
 along the Potomac River provided some rare hard data to the often baffling
 debate on conflicting estimates.12

 In considering the size of native populations?either at the beginning
 of the Columbian exchange in 1492 or at the point when written records
 began for each contact zone?ethnohistorians have been forced to revise
 their ideas of what "precontact" implies. They now realize that an
 aboriginal America isolated from European contacts and influences?not
 necessarily settlements?ceased to exist earlier than traditionally
 thought. Indian oral accounts and scraps of documentary evidence reveal
 that sporadic European contacts significantly influenced Indians along
 the mid-Atlantic coast some years before the major English colonies were
 established at Roanoke Island and Jamestown. According to Dobyns,
 "aboriginal lifeways for the native peoples of North America clearly
 terminated with the large-scale depopulation caused by the initial

 smallpox pandemic [in Spanish Mexico] in 1520-1524," and, as a result,
 archaeological and ethnohistorical research has been extended further
 back in time to account for cultural change that occurred in a
 "protohistoric" period that was transitional between an Indian-only,
 aboriginal world and the historic era of English settlement.13

 Despite the insight that study of the protohistoric era provides into the
 rapid alteration of stable native cultures that had matured over thousands
 of years, few researchers have yet to forego their preferences for ancient
 prehistory or the postcontact periods. The few who have remain un-
 daunted by archaeologist Dean Snow's contention that "discussion of
 archeological evidence in terms of the antecedents of historic Indians [of
 the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain] is . . . difficult at best." Recent work by
 David S. Phelps on the Carolina Algonquians, E. Randolph Turner III
 on the Powhatan chiefdom, Stephen R. Potter on the Chicacoan and
 other Potomac River Algonquians, and Wayne E. Clark on the Potomac
 Creek Complex in Maryland (ca. 1300-1700) has significantly advanced
 our knowledge and demonstrated the value of integrating archaeological
 fieldwork with the analysis of written records from later eras.14

 Although a synthesis of research on the late protohistoric and early
 contact eras is still years away, Feest's brief overviews of the mid-Atlantic
 Algonquians in the Handbook of North American Indians (1978) and
 Turner's 1985 essay on sociopolitical organization within the Powhatan
 chiefdom brought together much of the relevant multidisciplinary liter-
 ature. Their varying perspectives indicated that issues surrounding when
 and how the major tribes of the Contact Period first "arrived" in the
 Chesapeake region (as late invaders from other areas?); how and why they
 developed the complex institutions described by the English after 1607
 (as adaptations to indigenous needs or as responses to European intru-
 sions?); and how they were culturally and linguistically related to other
 Algonquians will be the important foci of future research into the
 protohistorical period.15

 If White and Harriot arrived too late to record a truly aboriginal coast
 unaffected by European contact or contagion, the "wylde menn of . . .
 [the English] nacione" who accompanied them on Ralegh's ships arrived
 much too soon to permit an easy adjustment by the Indians to the
 "invasion of America." English brutalities normally reserved for Spanish
 Catholics were directed against the "most gentle, loving, and faithfull"
 Algonquians of coastal Carolina, as the Roanoke colonists stole the
 Indians' food-tribute intended for their honored werowances and slaugh-
 tered tribesmen because of conspiracies, real or imagined.16 Morgan's
 American Slavery, American Freedom and Nash's "Image of the Indian in
 the Southern Colonial Mind" (1972) demonstrated how the idealistic,
 wish-fulfilling preconceptions of "noble savage" and "godlike English-
 man" quickly died amid the harsh realities of daily contacts between
 peoples of alien traditions and conflicting goals.17

 Ironically, at the climax of bloody confrontations at Roanoke, Ralegh's
 "Lost Colony" may have given reality to all of the hopeful, accom-
 modationist rhetoric after all. Although it would be one of the crudest
 ironies if now, after four centuries of slaughtering, enslaving, and
 stereotyping Indians for various acts of suspected treachery, it could be
 conclusively demonstrated that the English and Indians assimilated
 culturally and biologically from the beginnings of the colonization of
 America, recent interpretations suggest that that was indeed the case.

 David Beers Quinn, the most accomplished and prolific modern expert
 on England's age of discovery and early colonization, convincingly argued
 in Set Fair for Roanoke (1985) that Ralegh's refugees from Roanoke
 Island, abandoned by their countrymen, became subsumed by the Indian
 populations of the mid-Atlantic coast. Most significantly, though, he
 traced the final destination of their odyssey over several years to the
 friendly Chesapeaks, whose villages lay south of modern Portsmouth.
 Here, perhaps as late as the arrival of the Jamestown colonists in April
 1607, Powhatan allegedly killed the English and their Indian hosts when
 he added the Chesapeak lands to his expanding chiefdom. Quinn's
 compelling argument, supported by his comprehensive, multidisciplinary
 research, has already been integrated into other recent histories of

 Roanoke by David Stick (1983) and Karen Ordahl Kupperman (1984).
 Quinn's findings were most significant, for they reawakened historians to
 the close thematic, chronological, and now genetic and cultural, ties that
 connected the "New" Virginia of 1607 to Ralegh's "Ould Virginia."18

 The James River Contact Zone

 More than twenty years before the arrival of the Jamestown colonists,
 Englishmen had heard of a powerful and wealthy werowance along the
 James River who "would be loth to suffer any strangers to enter into his
 Countrey, and . . . [who] was able to make a great many of men into the
 fielde, which . . . would fight very well."19 By conquest and cajolery,
 Wahunsonacock, or Powhatan, had by 1607 consolidated more than two
 dozen Tidewater Algonquian village complexes into one of the largest and
 most centralized chiefdoms along the eastern seaboard. What could have
 prompted colonists, in the aftermath of the Roanoke debacle, to settle
 there? Why did Powhatan and his people allow Jamestown to survive?

 Historians and anthropologists alike have been endlessly fascinated by
 such questions, because the interaction of alien cultures along the James
 has had dramatic consequences for all subs?quent American history.
 Christian Feest's "Powhatan: A Study in Political Organization" (1966),
 Nancy Oestreich Lurie's "Indian Cultural Adjustment to European
 Civilization" (1959), and E. Randolph Turner Ill's "Socio-Political
 Organization within the Powhatan Chiefdom" (1985) brought anthropo-
 logical insights to bear on the Powhatans' weakness in political organi-
 zation and their vulnerability to hostile tribes on their borders as factors
 contributing to their defeat. In "Fighting Tire' with Firearms" (1979),
 "Opechancanough: Indian Resistance Leader" (1981), and "Patterns of
 Anglo-Indian Aggression and Accommodation" (1985), I found that the
 Powhatans relied too much on their traditional military prowess to
 protect their culture from outside influences. Feeling supremely self-
 confident in 1607, they failed to see the threat in the English presence,
 but their vulnerability was demonstrated in their disastrous defeat in the
 First Anglo-Powhatan War (1609-14). Despite their revitalization under
 Nemattanew and Opechancanough and their brilliant adaptability to the

 tactics and technology of European warfare, the proud Powhatans
 gambled on total defeat rather than face partial surrender in the
 ambitious uprisings of 1622 and 1644.20

 Although novelists and popular historians have traditionally focused
 their attention on Pocahontas or her father, Powhatan, in their writings,
 scholars have recognized Opechancanough as a far more important and
 fascinating representative of his people. Carl Bridenbaugh recently
 maintained that the Virginia Indian "cacique," Don Luis de Velasco,
 raised by the Spanish and responsible for the destruction of the Jesuits'
 Virginia mission, was none other than Opechancanough. Bridenbaugh's
 two essays (1980, 1981) on this subject made an interesting case out of
 some dubious evidence, but the implications of his interpretation raise
 troubling issues among contemporary ethnohistorians. To contend that
 Don Luis/Opechancanough?a Catholic convert well-versed in Spanish
 culture?was the catalyst behind all four of Virginia's famous "massa-
 cres" (of the Jesuits in 1571, the Roanoke refugees in 1607, and the
 Jamestown colonists in 1622 and 1644) trivialized the many complex and
 justifiable reasons behind the Powhatans' uprisings and in so doing
 implied that Opechancanough's awesome domination of his people for
 seventy years was somehow owing to his "superior" European
 education.21

 Much of the recent revival of interest in Virginia's earliest Anglo-
 Indian relations has been stimulated by the publication of essential
 primary sources. Philip L. Barbour's masterful three-volume edition of
 The Complete Works of Captain John Smith (1986), prepared under the
 auspices of the Institute of Early American History and Culture in
 Williamsburg, is a rare and timeless treasure. David Beers Quinn's
 collection of Virginia sources (1606-12) in the last volume of his New
 American World (1979) complemented the materials in Barbour's earlier
 Jamestown Voyages (1969); both works, however, lacked sufficiently
 detailed annotation on the complexities of intercultural contacts. More
 comprehensive than either is W. Stitt Robinson's Virginia Treaties, two
 volumes in the collection of Early American Indian Documents: Treaties and

 Vaughan. Robinson's appropriately annotated volumes actually contain a
 fuller record of Anglo-Indian relations than the designation "treaties and
 laws" implies.22

 Mining this rich body of Virginia sources, historians have recently
 analyzed early intercultural contacts in Virginia from three primary
 perspectives. One approach, represented by Morgan's American Slavery,
 American Freedom and H. C. Porter's Inconstant Savage: England and the
 North American Indian, 1500-1660 (1979), found the alternative life-
 styles and world views of the Powhatans useful for achieving their
 ultimate objective?a thematic interpretation of colonial society with
 little concern for the complex process of mutual acculturation. Another
 approach, represented by Bernard W. Sheehan's Savagism and Civility
 (1980), equated the "Indian" with the idea of savagery and analyzed the
 intellectual evolution of that image more as a philosophical exercise than
 as a balanced treatment of relations between flesh-and-blood people. A
 third, ethnohistorical, approach, represented by J. Leitch Wright, Jr., in
 The Only Land They Knew (1981), analyzed the process of acculturation,
 in all its variety and complexity, from the Indians' perspective. Wright's
 treatment of the Powhatans and other Southern Indians as active

 protagonists engaged in modifying their traditional cultures to meet the
 challenges of colonization increased our understanding of native peoples
 far more than the other works.23

 Although Morgan's ambitious and challenging synthesis of colonial
 Virginia substantially advanced the new social history of the Chesapeake,

 Virginia (Cambridge, London, and New York, 1980); J. Leitch Wright, Jr., The Only Land They Knew: The
 Tragic Story of the American Indians in the Old South (New York, 1981). In order to provide some analytical
 depth on the more influential recent works in the early contact era, I have restricted my discussion to Morgan,
 Sheehan, and Wright. Porter's book should not be taken too seriously, because in both style and quality of
 analysis it is reminiscent of mediocre nineteenth-century antiquarianism. Karen Ordahl Kupperman's Settling
 With the Indians: The Meeting of English and Indian Cultures in America, 1580-1640 (Totowa, N.J., 1980), is
 not so easily characterized in terms of the approaches I stress. Kupperman's ethnohistorical instincts and
 insights are good, but I feel that she overly emphasizes the English commentators on contact experiences in
 early New England and the Chesapeake.

 he often mistook cultural prejudice for racism (his thematic "ordeal") in
 Anglo-Powhatan relations and was generally insensitive, and frequently
 inaccurate, in his appraisal of the Tidewater Algonquians. His portrayal
 of the "Indians' habitual idleness" (supposedly interrupted only by "gang
 wars," "chopping a few people to bits," or "hunting as sport") was a
 convenient vehicle for comparing English attitudes toward work in a
 colonial society that would later adopt black slavery, but such distortions
 and caricatures of the Powhatans served to damage the author's credi-
 bility. Moreover, Morgan cavalierly dismissed ethnographic evidence
 from reliable seventeenth-century witnesses?he denied, for example,
 that Powhatan collected a huge tribute in food and furs from his people?
 and instead cited eighteenth-century sources from outside Virginia to
 make a point about the Pamunkeys in the Early Contact Period (whom he
 misidentified as a Potomac River people).24

 Given the intertwined, interdependent nature of early Anglo-
 Powhatan relations, the errors of interpretation that Morgan committed
 on one side of the intercultural frontier had unfortunate consequences
 for fully understanding the other. Thus, by erroneously assuming that
 "the Indians could afford to give up the land around Jamestown . . .
 [and] made no concerted effort to drive the English out," Morgan ignored
 the significant First Anglo-Powhatan War, in which Indians drove
 colonists from outposts at Nansemond and Nonesuch before they nearly
 starved the remaining English to death during the siege of Jamestown
 (November 1609 to March 1610). It was the emaciated, angry, and
 hungry English survivors of these ordeals who soon after sought revenge
 in Indian cornfields. By ignoring detail and context in earlier relations,
 Morgan understandably misinterpreted the clear meaning of the colonial
 raiders who "cutt downe" the Powhatans' ripe maize in order to eat, not
 destroy, it, and he could only condemn what he failed to understand: "It
 is not easy to make sense out of the behavior displayed. . . . How to
 explain the suicidal impulse that led the hungry English to destroy the
 corn that might have fed them and to commit atrocities upon the people
 who grew it?"25

 for, Sheehan would have us believe that they were so intellectually
 preoccupied with the image of the Indian-as-savage that they forswore
 profits for philosophy. Convinced that the colonists were trapped by
 prejudicial preconceptions of savagism and therefore "could never grasp
 the reality of their dealings with the native inhabitants of America,"
 Sheehan was himself snared by the actions of the English that contra-
 dicted his thesis. For him, the Powhatan Uprising of 22 March 1622?
 rather consistently, and correctly, interpreted as a significant watershed
 in the history of Anglo-Indian relations over the last three and a half
 centuries?represented "no decisive turning point," because the colo-
 nists' "decision to massacre the Indians . . . was ... a continuation of

 the English determination to rid the world of savagism" that the colonists
 had arrived with in 1607. Although London intellectuals amused them-
 selves with saccharine stereotypes of Indians that easily metamorphosed
 into punitive prejudices as their mood dictated, to say that the Jamestown
 colonists viewed their relations with the Powhatans as a "clash between

 cosmic forces" ignored a broad range of behavior between the cultures.
 Ironically, it was the colonists most threatened?those who had wit-
 nessed the deaths of a fourth of their comrades in the 1622 uprising?
 who pragmatically determined that their future survival depended upon
 new, cooperative relations with "savages." Launching limited, not lethal,
 raids (which they called "feedfights") on Powhatan cornfields, the
 colonists eschewed genocide and instead formed important military and
 trade alliances with friendly Eastern Shore and Potomac River tribes. By
 1630 commercial opportunities, not Sheehan's "cosmic forces," had given
 birth to the Virginians' beaver trade with invaluable Indian partners,
 which permitted a profitable, pragmatic complacency with the perpetu-
 ation of "savagism," to no one's surprise but Sheehan's.26

 In contrast to Morgan and Sheehan, Wright's appreciation of and
 sensitivity to the multidimensional contacts between the cultures allowed
 him to analyze the process of colonization from the inside out. Informed

 J. Frederick Fausz, "Fighting 'Fire' With Firearms," pp. 33-50. The colonists' decision to segregate
 themselves from the hostile Powhatans meant neither that they were adopting (or readopting) immutable
 racist attitudes with regard to all Indians nor that they were pursuing a retaliatory war of genocide. Historians
 often fail to differentiate the views of Londoners (who called for the extermination of the Powhatans) from
 those of the colonists, which varied considerably between 1622 and 1630. Cf. this appraisal with Alden T.

 by a generation of important interdisciplinary studies on Native Ameri-
 cans, he provided refreshing contexts for integrating the English intru-
 sion with Powhatan cultural history and for evaluating Chesapeake
 Anglo-Indian relations in terms of a maturing, expanding, triracial South
 in the eighteenth century.27

 On to New "Frontiers"

 In 1631 new frontiers began to influence Virginia's interethnic

 relations, both chronologically and spatially. In that year, Captain John
 Smith, one of the last surviving of the first colonists and the best of their

 chroniclers, breathed his last and seemingly thrust Virginia history into
 its "dark ages." Without Smith to rely on, many historians, then and
 now, recoiled from the prospect of extracting the skimpy details of
 Anglo-Indian relations from the ravaged remnants of colonial records.
 Without a compiler as curious and an interpreter as insightful as Smith
 had been, knowledge of Virginia Indians languished in subsequent
 colonial decades, despite the brilliance of Robert Beverley's 1705 History.
 To some extent, it languishes still. There is no substantial scholarly
 interpretation of Anglo-Indian relations covering the critical period
 between 1644 and 1700, although the research of Stephen R. Potter on
 the Algonquians of the Northern Neck (1976) and Douglas W. Boyce on
 the Iroquoians of the coastal plain (1978) have suggested the combined
 archaeological and archival routes to follow. Despite the important start

 Anglo-Indian Relations in the Chesapeake 151

 Claiborne established his ambitious Kent Island fur-trading enterprise in
 the northern Chesapeake, which in effect brought the influential
 Susquehannocks into Virginia's multicultural history and provided the
 thematic link for Virginia's intercolonial relations with Maryland.

 In "Present at the 'Creation': The Chesapeake World That Greeted
 the Maryland Colonists" (1984), I analyzed the critical role that the
 Virginia beaver traders played in transmitting the valuable lessons of
 aboriginal and colonial adaptations to the new Maryland settlers. The
 Anglo-Indian interest group alliances that exploited the fur trade and
 minimized conflicts between interethnic neighbors were also studied in
 James H. Merrell's "Cultural Continuity among the Piscataway Indians
 of Colonial Maryland" (1979). This influential essay demonstrated the
 important distinctions between Anglo-Indian relations in Virginia and
 Maryland and found that "accommodation was possible for many [native
 groups] who were neither powerful nor shattered" by colonial contacts.
 Barry Kent's archaeological and ethnohistorical overview of Susquehanna's
 Indians (1984) imparted a wealth of information and interpretive sensi-
 tivity that should serve as a model for other researchers. Francis
 Jennings, the dean of Susquehannock studies, compressed years of
 research into his succinct and informative entry on that people in the
 Handbook of North American Indians (1978) and in the suggestive essay
 "Indians and Frontiers in Seventeenth Century Maryland" (1982). The
 pivotal role that the Susquehannock played in Anglo-Indian affairs of the
 later seventeenth century was analyzed in 1984 by both Webb and
 Jennings. The latter's Ambiguous Iroquois Empire addressed the complex
 interweavings of Anglo-Indian and multicolonial relationships across
 eastern North America into the mid-eighteenth century and revealed how
 the imperial diplomacy of the "Covenant Chain" emerged as "the primary
 instrument for opening the trans-Appalachian West to British colo-
 nization."29

 With the recent recognition of the extent to which Virginia influenced,
 and was influenced by, a variety of chronological and spatial frontiers as
 colonial America matured, it is appropriate that local ethnohistorians

 must look beyond the traditional borders of the Old Dominion for
 interpretive inspiration. Almost everything remains to be done in eigh-
 teenth-century Virginia Indian studies, but fortunately, there are many
 insightful interpretations of other contact zones to serve as excellent
 examples. Anthony F. C. Wallace's stimulating classic, The Death and
 Rebirth of the Seneca (1969), brilliantly analyzed the challenges and
 changes that transformed that important Iroquois tribe, while William
 Cronori's soon-to-be-classic Changes in the Land (1983) masterfully
 interpreted the environmental effect of interethnic contact and accultur-
 ation. In "The Indians' New World: The Catawba Experience" (1984),
 James H. Merrell focused attention on the migrations and adaptations
 through which Indians coped with contact worlds that were as new to
 them as they were to European immigrants. In The European and the
 Indian (1981), James Axtell also insightfully investigated the adaptations
 of America's indigenous residents as they became a minority population in
 the eighteenth century, while Francis Jennings's "Indians' Revolution"
 (1976) reflected on the loss of native independence as the colonists were
 winning theirs.30

 The colonists' victory in the American Revolution eliminated the
 diplomatic leverage that some tribes had exercised when the French held
 Canada and absentee London policymakers dominated the affairs of the
 Covenant Chain. Many Indians faced bleak futures of reservations and
 relocations, as white politicians on both local and national levels increas-
 ingly came to regard them as anachronistic impediments to the "progres-
 sive" and popular exploitation of America's rich resources. Indians who
 had fought with, as well as those who had fought against, the Americans
 in their war with the British, and Indians who tried to assimilate as well

 as those who resisted absorption, were equally victimized by the emer-
 gence of a race-based Manifest Destiny in the post-Revolution decades.
 Recent scholarship has contributed little to our knowledge of what
 Virginia Indians, either as individuals or groups, were doing in the period
 from the American Revolution to the era of Indian removal in the first

 half of the nineteenth century. The attentions of whites, then as now,
 generally focused on native peoples whose threatening power or coveted
 possessions placed them at the center of conflict and controversy.

 Anglo-Indian Relations in the Chesapeake 153

 Although Powhatan's descendants were spared the tragedy of these later
 wars and land grabbing, they nevertheless suffered as all Indians did from
 the growth of racial prejudice. Supplementing the pervasive ethnocen-
 trism of the first colonists, racism became a driving force in tfre new
 nation almost from the founding of the United States to the celebration
 of its bicentennial, so that an appreciation of ethnic stereotypes is
 essential for understanding how Virginia's Indians were treated.

 In this context, Alden T. Vaughan's "From White Man to Redskin"

 (1982) examined changing perceptions of pigmentation that ensured that
 the Indians' "separate and unequal status [would] become firmly fixed in
 the American mind." Bernard W. Sheehan's Seeds of Extinction (1973)
 and Reginald Horsman's Race and Manifest Destiny (1981) explored the
 linkages between prejudice and policy that helped mold a variety of
 negative images of Indians in the nineteenth century. Richard Drinnon's
 often angry and polemical Facing West (1980) warned of the "Indian-
 hating" that is still evident in American attitudes and actions at home and
 abroad, while Raymond William Stedman's Shadows of the Indian (1982)
 surveyed the pervasive ethnic stereotypes that insidiously continue to
 plague us.31

 Discovering the "Survivors'

 In analyzing Virginia Indians of the nineteenth and twentieth centu-
 ries, scholars have had to work as excavators in order to rescue the native

 survivors of earlier contacts and conflicts from a historical death-by-
 obscurity after their burial under the rubble of racism. Recognizing that
 local Indians suffered under the out-of-sight, out-of-mind syndrome and
 were officially classified as "coloreds" under slavery and Jim Crowism,
 modern ethnohistorians have performed two vital functions: first, con-
 vincing the contemporary majority population that Indians did not vanish
 in or after the colonial period, and second, interpreting the centuries of
 seemingly lost identity between then and now. These are tasks usually
 performed best by anthropologists, because the fieldwork skills of inter-
 viewing surviving descendants and writing accounts sensitive to ethnic

 sensibilities have more traditionally been components of their profes-
 sional training than of historians' training.

 Although many historians believe that associating or identifying too
 closely with present-day Indians threatens their own objectivity, scholars'
 decisions to concentrate on past white policies and policymakers while
 avoiding any involvement with current controversial ethnic issues raise
 problems of another kind. There is a tendency among historians today to
 be more interested in process than people and more congratulatory about
 the Indians who acculturated or assimilated than condemnatory of the
 self-serving white policies and prejudices that forced such choices upon
 them. Weighing his or her personal disposition and political philosophy as
 well as data, each ethnohistorian must evaluate the ramifications of
 scholarly "neutrality."

 Regardless of such dilemmas, the ethnohistorical scholarship on

 Chesapeake Indians from the mid-nineteenth century to the present is
 rich and rewarding, and the interpretations of the modern era rival those
 for the Early Contact Period both in terms of quantity and quality. In a
 broader regional context, C. A. Weslager's Nanticoke Indians?Past and
 Present (1983) surveyed that scattered but unshattered tribe of
 Maryland's Eastern Shore from colonial contacts to the 1980s. Frank W.
 Porter Ill's 1978 Ph.D. dissertation on the Nanticokes likewise exam-

 ined their "quest for identity," while his essay "Behind the Frontier:
 Indian Survivals in Maryland" (1980) provided a convenient and succinct
 overview of other Native American groups. Abraham Makofsky's "Tra-
 dition and Change in the Lumbee Indian Community of Baltimore"
 (1980) explored one Indian city subculture and typified the growing field
 of urban ethnohistory. Adolph Dial and David Eliades's Only Land 1
 Know: A History of the Lumbee Indians (1975), W. McKee Evans's "North
 Carolina Lumbees" (1979), and Karen I. Blu's Lumbee Problem: The
 Making of an American Indian People (1980) analyzed the complex issues
 of race, culture, and class confronting that controversial "marginal
 group" of the mid-Atlantic states. Feest's entries on the native peoples of
 Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina in the Handbook of North
 American Indians (1978) were brief but informative on the twentieth
 century, while Brewton Berry's "Marginal Groups" in the same volume
 discussed a particularly important issue in contemporary Native Ameri-
 can affairs. Donald L. Fixico's "Twentieth Century Federal Indian
 Policy," Russell Thornton's "Contemporary American Indians," and
 Peter Iverson's "Indian Tribal Histories"?all in Scholars and the Indian

 Experience (1984)?provided interpretive summaries and bibliographical
 surveys of topics of concern to Indians and Indian historians every-
 where.32

 In recent years, Helen C. Rountree, an anthropologist at Old Domin-
 ion University, has made particularly valuable contributions to
 ethnohistorical scholarship and the vital Indian communities in Virginia.
 Through her dissertation, "Indian Land Loss in Virginia" (1973), and
 influential essays, such as "Powhatan's Descendants in the Modern
 World" (1972), "Change Came Slowly: The Case of the Powhatan
 Indians of Virginia" (1975), and "The Indians of Virginia: A Third Race
 in a Biracial State" (1979), she has related national issues and trends in
 both contemporary policies and scholarly interpretations to local condi-
 tions. Rountree's personal contacts with Pamunkeys, Mattaponis,
 Chickahominys, and other Native Americans in the state through
 extensive fieldwork have given her the knowledge as well as the
 sensitivity to interpret Opechancanough's descendants over many centu-
 ries and in all situations.33

 Building upon the rich legacy of multicultural relations and the recent
 scholarship that has rediscovered it, the essays that follow in this special
 issue of the Virginia Magazine illustrate the value of ethnohistorical
 inquiry from a variety of perspectives. Historian David D. Smits exam-
 ines the ethnocentric barriers and special circumstances that restrained
 the English colonists from sharing the most intimate of human experi-
 ences with local Indians. From that threshold of potential assimilability
 three centuries distant, sociologist Paul T. Murray's essay focuses our

 attention on those Indians who, in the 1940s, pressed for their special,
 separate identity against a color-conscious society determined to view
 people and most issues as either black or white. In her essay, anthropol-
 ogist Helen C. Rountree investigates the chronological middle ground
 between those earliest contacts and more recent controversies and

 rescues the Nottoway from the interpretive obscurity of the eighteenth
 and nineteenth centuries.

 This survey of recent literature on Anglo-Indian relations has, it is

 hoped, shed new light on both scholars and their subjects. The conquest
 of cant now allows us, indeed requires us, as researchers and citizens to
 appreciate Indians for what they were and are in all their individual
 uniqueness and cultural diversity. For despite the countless alternatives
 in lifeways and world views that Indians have encountered, individually
 and collectively, since Europeans and Africans joined them in the
 Chesapeake, Indians' defiant loyalty to a distinctive identity as Indians?
 irrespective of appearance or life-style?has remained their most consis-
 tent and valuable contribution in an ancient and ongoing legacy to
 American history. The studies cited here have made progress in under-
 standing Indian identity and its effect over the centuries, but only time
 will tell how future generations of scholars will make use of that paper
 produced so near where the Pamunkeys lived in 1607?and where many
 of them still live today.
