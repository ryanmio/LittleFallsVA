ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Review from outside the National Park Service was graciously
provided by State Historic Preservation Offices and several
individual archeologists. I wish to thank Randy Turner (Virginia
SHPO), Beth Cole (Maryland SHPO), Nancy Kassner (DC HPO) and Pat
Trader (West Virginia SHPO) for their comments and support. I
thank Russ Handsman (Anthropology Department, University of Rhode
Island) for his review and comments. I am particularly grateful to
Jeffrey Hantman of the Anthropology Department at the University of
Virginia and to Carol Ebright of the Maryland State Highways
Administration Archeology Group for their extensive, insightful,
and tactful comments, especially on those sections dealing with
prehistory.

Review within the National Park Service was provided by several
individuals. The Cultural Resource Specialists in each park within
the National Capital Area were provided an opportunity to review
the first draft. Thanks to Marcia Keener and Mike Shaver (of
Prince William Forest Park), Bob Grumet (of the National Register
Programs Office in Philadelphia), and Michele Aubry (WASO Division
of Anthropology) for taking the time to read the first draft.

Cari YoungRavenhorst (Harpers Ferry NHP) pulled together several
resources about historic artifacts for me. John Ravenhorst
(Harpers Ferry NHP) designed the cover, Figures I.1 and I.2 were
done by the GIS Services of the National Capital Area System
Support Office. Marian Creveling provided Table III.2.

I would like to thank Regional Archeologist Stephen R. Potter for
his initiative in getting this plan and its implementation
underway, for his support, comments and suggestions, insight into
regional archeology needs, and, most of all, for more than 15 years
of high quality research in this ag sige Without his recent book,

Culture. in the Potomac Walley, weiting the PeqiOnAL overview of
this plan would have been a truly daunting task.

As in everything I do, I am grateful for the help and support of
Paul A. Shackel (Harpers Ferry NHP). He took the time to read and
comment on the first draft - and the second - and to offer lots of
good advice on both content and layout.

Thanks are also due to all the archeologists in the mid-Atlantic
whose work is drawn upon here. I hope that they find this plan
useful.

And, not least, thanks to all the folks at the Regional Office (now

the System Support Office) and in the Parks who helped make working
on this plan a real pleasure.

HOW TO USE THIS PLAN

This plan is designed to address the needs of park managers who are
charged with stewardship of cultural resources. The overview
section of the plan is primarily designed for archeologists but it
should also be useful to other cultural resource specialists, to
natural resource specialists with an interest in how people used
and were affected by the natural environment, and interpreters who
wish to convey some of the rich complexity of American heritage to
park visitors.

Park Managers:

It is recommended that Park Managers read the Management Summary
and the sections other than the following technical portions:
Section II, which is the Regional Overview, the final part of
Section I on the physical environment and the part on Survey
Coverage and Methods in Section IV. Park Managers may also be
interested in reading the Abstract of the Regional Overview to get
a sense of the kind of information available. They may then choose
which technical sections interest them.

CRM specialists:

This plan should serve as a reference and information base; it is
meant to be a flexible tool. It should help in assessing each
park's cultural resources and in placing work that has been done
into context in addition to identifying what further work needs to
be done. It is recommended that CRM specialists begin with the
Management Summary, Abstract of the Regional Overview, and the part
of Section III pertaining to the relevant park.

Archeologists:

This plan should serve as a reference document and research tool
for contracted or in-house archeologists and for archeologists
outside of the NPS. Section II, the Regional Overview, the final
part of Section I on the physical environment, and the part on
Survey Coverage and Methods in Section IV are particularly
important.

Interpreters:

This plan should serve as a reference and information base; it is
meant to be a flexible tool. It is recommended that Interpreters
read the Abstract of the Regional Overview as well as the part of
Section III pertaining to the relevant park and then use the Table
of Contents to find parts of interest in the text for further
information.


=== Page 15 ===

Law Enforcement Rangers:

In conjunction with the enforcement of the Archeological Resources
Protection Act (ARPA), Law Enforcement Rangers may wish to become
familiar with the survey plan and with the archeological resources
of each park. It is recommended that Law Enforcement Rangers read
the Management Summary and the Abstract of the Regional Overview as
well as the section of Park III pertaining to the relevant park.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Table of Contents shows the structure of this plan. The
Management Summary highlights some of the major points aside from
the Regional Overview (Part ITI). An abstract of the Regional
Overview is provided in the following section,

Background

The Systemwide Archeological Inventory Program (SAIP), also known
as the National Archeological Survey Initiative (NASI), was
established in response to the identification of a material
weakness in the Park Archeology Program, servicewide. The weakness
stems from the fact that there is inadequate knowledge of
archeological site location and therefore inadequate ability to
protect and preserve these cultural resources.

The overall goal and objectives of SAIP are as follows (NPS
1992:2):

GOAL: Conduct systematic, scientific research to locate,
evaluate, and document archeological resources on
National Park System lands.

OBJECTIVES: 1. Determine the nature and extent of archeological
resources in park areas.

2. Record and evaluate those resources, including
nominating eligible properties for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.

3, Recommend appropriate strategies for conserving,
protecting, preserving in situ, managing, and
interpreting those resources.

Documents to be produced include Archeological Overview and
Assessments, and Archeological Identification and Evaluation
Studies. These documents, including an archeological base map,
will provide information needed by park managers, planners,
interpreters, law enforcement officers and other specialists to
effectively carry out their responsibilities for the protection and
interpretation of archeological resources.

The survey and inventory will partially fulfill certain
requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act, Executive
Order 11593 (Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment), the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and NPS~
28, Cultural Resource Management Guideline.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY xii

National Capital Area Parks

The National Capital Area, formerly the National Capital Region
(NCR), of the National Park Service encompasses Washington, D.C.
and environs within the drainage basin of the Potomac River
(Fig.1). From the Occoquan River in Prince William County,
Virginia to the source of the Potomac in Cumberland, Maryland to
the mighty confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac in Harpers
Ferry, West Virginia, the parks in this region contain rich and
diverse cultural and natural resources. Archeology within the
region has provided far-ranging insight into human lives, from the
earliest human immigration to the area 11-12,000 years ago, to the
devastation of Native American displacement, to the wreckage of the
Civil War, to industrial development.

Figure 1 (page 2) shows the National Capital Area and Table I.3
(page 14) provides a summary of park lands in the Area.

Figure 2 (page 25) shows the Potomac River Basin and the major
physiographic divisions. Table I.5 shows the locations of parks or
portions of parks in major physiographic regions,

Archeology

While archaeology may in a sense be the past-tense of
anthropology, it is not the past-tense of anthropology alone.
Renfrew 1982:4

On a map of the sciences, archaeology would be a border state
between the natural and social sciences. It is like a social
science in that the objects of interest are people, human
culture and artifacts created under the influence of ideas and
social norms . . . archaeology is also like a natural science
in that its focus in on the material remains of people in the
past and on their relation with the natural environment.
Kosso 1991:621

In the United States archeology is considered part of the broader
discipline of anthropology, literally the study of humans. As
anthropology developed in this country in academic and museum
settings through the 19th and 20th centuries, all of its sub-
specialties were closely tied to the study of native American
peoples. Ethnography and ethnology were concerned with documenting
and comparing contemporary, living societies; anthropological
linguists recorded native languages; biological anthropologists
studied and compared physical characteristics of peoples;
archeologists investigated the tangible remains -- the artifacts
and architecture -— of past societies.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY xiii


=== Page 18 ===

Anthropology as a profession has, of course, expanded to study far
more than native peoples and archeology is concerned with much more
than objects. What Lord Renfrew meant by the first remark quoted
above is that because archeology is concerned with the remains of
what has gone before, it is relevant to a whole range of fields,
since many fields of study have tangible remains that may inform
about the past. Such fields include architectural history,
cultural landscape studies, and history. The link among all the
remains studied by archeologists is an interest in past human
activity.

Archeology as a study has the advantage of time depth and a breadth
of data for comparisons. The material remains which survive for
archeological study are varied, yet they obviously cannot represent
the whole of a living culture. Even though the material remains
are partial remains they are not inconsequential, but are the

remains of human action and intention. Archeology relies to a
great extent on insights and methods developed in the natural
sciences. The formation, preservation, and degradation of

archaeological sites and their contents are only understood by
applying geology, soil science, hydrology, chemistry, and the like.

What I have attempted to do here is to present a productive and
interesting structure for an archeological plan that may serve for
the next few decades. I have assessed the trends in the discipline
and have organized this discussion for general usefulness. In
addressing each topic I often describe the approach of some major
work(s) not necessarily confined to regional concerns in order to
provide a context for thinking about archeological data in the
Potomac Basin. Not all of the theoretical positions or approaches
I mention have been used in the mid-Atlantic and I wish to suggest
that they may be applied. I do not, however, seek to develop a
critique of mid-Atlantic archeology, as that would be an effort far
outside of the scope of this plan.

A Note on Time Notation

Conventional time notation of years as B.C. or A.D. is abandoned
here in favor of the theologically neutral BCE (Before Current
Era), which is equivalent to B.C., and CE (Current Era), which is
equivalent to A.D. Dates are often given as BP (Before Present).
For archeologists, "present" is defined as 1950 CE. Usually I have
simply added 2000 years to a BCE designation for an approximate
date BP.

Status of Archeological Inventory
For most parks in the National Capital Area the status and adequacy

of archeology is poor. One park and some sections of others have

for the region as a whole was created in 1963 and therefore is
missing not only many known sites, but also whole park units.

There is locational information in paper files for all recorded
sites in the National Capital Area, although it is clear that many
sites known on park land have not been recorded with the
appropriate state or district repository. In most cases site
locations are marked on USGS maps. There is not yet a coherent GIS
data base of archeological sites in the region. Setting up such a
data base, with appropriate security measures to protect locational
information, should be a priority of each park.

Table III.1 (page 201) summarizes data for the status of inventory
and documentation for each park.

Of the approximately 78,000 acres in the National Capital Area
parks, about 6% has been inventoried at a sufficient level of
intensity that further systematic inventory is not necessary (given
current standards). Approximately another 11% has been inventoried
by less than full-coverage and requires further inventory to meet
current standards.

A brief synopsis for each park is provided. Sample issues for
archeological research also are noted. Tables III.3 (page 213)
through III.15 (page 259) provide a chronological listing of
archeological work in each park.

Project Needs

For each survey and inventory project the following, at a minimum,
should be accomplished. These are detailed as Requirement #3 of
SAIP (NPS 1992:6):

1) Consulting and coordinating projects with appropriate NPS
and non-NPS projects;

2) Preparing or revising Archeological Overview and
Assessments;

3) Preparing research designs for field studies;

4) Undertaking other appropriate studies and activities that
are essential to successfully plan and implement archeological
inventories; for example, consulting or conducting
geomorphological studies; creation and maintenance of GIS and
relational data bases, including survey boundaries and
intensity and non-site artifact finds as well as site
locations; and special studies such as pollen and phytolith

analysis, which contribute valuable information to historic
cultural landscape studies;

5) Preparing interim and final archeological reports;
6) Recording site locational data on Historical Base Maps;

7) Entering data about archeological resources into the NPS's
computerized archeological site data base (ASMIS);

8) Cataloging archeological objects and specimens into the
NPS's National Catalog of Museum Objects using the Automated
National Catalog System (ANCS);

9) Stabilizing and preparing archeological collections for
storaqde;

10) Preparing National Register of Historic Places nominations
for eligible archeological resources (individual sites,
Multiple Property Listings, Archeological Districts) ;

11) Making the projects’ results available to park managers,
planners, interpreters, and other appropriate NPS specialists;
and

12) Making the project's results available to the professional
community and to the public, as appropriate.

There are only a few formal Overview and Assessment documents for
parks or sections of parks within the National Capital Area (see
Table III.1). This plan is designed to serve as an archeological
overview of the entire National Capital Area. It provides an
overview of history and prehistory within the Potomac Basin
(excluding the Shenandoah River Valley). It also provides data on
site predictive models and predicted site locations. However, it
does not provide the level of detail required at the park level.
For example, this plan's overview does not provide historic maps of
park areas or details about landforms which are essential for
predicting and testing site locations.

Archeological inventory projects traditionally have focused on
single park units and, for the most part, projects proposed in this
plan do so as well. No projects involving parks outside of the
National Capital Area are proposed in this draft of the SAIP plan.
While it would be possible to plan such projects, the anticipated
difficulties in scheduling funding and sharing resources outweighed
the advantages. It remains possible to design such projects if
logistical problems can be addressed.

Archeological evaluation projects and National Register nominations
often will cover just one site. However, in many cases it would be

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY xvi


=== Page 21 ===

advantageous to complete a Multiple Property Listing nomination for
a particular category of sites within a park or throughout parks
within a cluster. With a Multiple Property Listing in place,
several individual nominations may be prepared and placed in
context. One advantage to such an approach is that, because the
multiple listing compiles relevant information and explains the
significance of many properties, it is readily adaptable to
interpretive needs. For example, portions of Multiple Property
Listings may be modified into pamphlets or brochures for the
visiting public. Such documents also provide park interpreters
with ready access to information about their park and neighboring
parks.

When archeological survey and inventory has been completed for
particular park units, it may be reasonable to prepare nominations
of archeological districts. Of course, it is often appropriate to
prepare individual nominations for sites which have been evaluated
and determined eligible.

ABSTRACT OF THE REGIONAL OVERVIEW

Physical Environment of the National Capital Area

Figure I.1 (page 2) shows the National Capital Area and Table I.3
(page 14) provides a summary of park lands in the Area.

Figure I.2 (page 25) shows the Potomac River Basin and the major
physiographic divisions. Table I.5 (page 26) shows the locations of
parks or portions of parks in major physiographic regions.

There are three sharply defined physiographic zones in the eastern
United States paralleling the Atlantic shore from New England
almost to the Gulf of Mexico. These are the Coastal Plain,
Piedmont Plateau, and the Appalachian Province. The latter has
three divisions: 1) the Blue Ridge district; 2) the Greater
Appalachian Valley including the Great Valley (Hagerstown Valley in
Maryland and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia) and the Allegheny
ridges; and 3) the Allegheny Plateau.

Climatic conditions and even the physical characteristics of the
land have changed over the past 12,000 years, presenting
inhabitants with variable conditions. Each physiographic region
exhibits some difference not only in topography but also in
available food resources and raw materials such as stone and clay.

Two sections on physical environment follow a brief discussion of
available resources. The first is a brief discussion of
environmental parameters and constraints before present conditions.
The second is a more detailed, geographic description of the
physiographic provinces within the Potomac Basin. It is provided
here not only because such information is sometimes difficult to
find, but also because it provides the interpretive staff in each
park an idea of that park's natural setting in relation to other
parks in the region. Because there has been traffic for thousands
of years between these areas, it also provides some sense of the
different circumstances people confronted prehistorically and
historically.

Archeology

The introduction to the regional overview provides some comments on
the discipline of archeology to orient both archeologists and non-
archeologists to the concepts that underlie the overview in this
plan. A glance at the Table of Contents will reveal the structure
of this overview.

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xViLL


=== Page 23 ===

While archaeology may in a sense be the past-tense of
anthropology, it is not the past-tense of anthropology alone.
Renfrew 1982:4

On a map of the sciences, archaeology would be a border state
between the natural and social sciences. It is like a social
science in that the objects of interest are people, human
culture and artifacts created under the influence of ideas and
social norms . . . archaeology is also like a natural science
in that its focus in on the material remains of people in the
past and on their relation with the natural environment.
Kosso 1991:621

In the United States archeology is considered part of the broader
discipline of anthropology, literally the study of humans. As
anthropology developed in this country in academic and museum
settings through the 19th and 20th centuries, all of its sub-
specialties were closely tied to the study of native American
peoples. Ethnography and ethnology were concerned with documenting
and comparing contemporary, living societies; anthropological
linguists recorded native languages; biological anthropologists
studied and compared physical characteristics of peoples;
archeologists investigated the tangible remains -- the artifacts
and architecture -- of past societies.

Anthropology as a profession has, of course, expanded to study far
more than native peoples and archeology is concerned with much more
than objects. What Lord Renfrew meant by the first remark quoted
above is that because archeology is concerned with the remains of
what has gone before, it is relevant to a whole range of fields,
since many fields of study have tangible remains that may inform
about the past. Such fields include architectural history,
cultural landscape studies, and history. The link among all the
remains studied by archeologists is an interest in past human
activity.

Archeology as a study has the advantage of time depth and a breadth
ef data for comparisons. The material remains which survive for
archeological study are varied, yet they obviously cannot represent
the whole of a living culture. Even though the material remains
are partial remains they are not inconsequential, but are the
remains of human action and intention. Archeology relies to a
great extent on insights and methods developed in the natural
sciences. The formation, preservation, and degradation of
archaeological sites and their contents are only understood by
applying geology, soil science, hydrology, chemistry, and the like.

It is commonly accepted that the three main goals of archeology are
1) the establishment of cultural chronological sequences; 2) the
elucidation of past lifeways; and 3) explanation of processes of
cultural change, such as the development of food producing

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xix


=== Page 24 ===

economies from hunting-gathering ones and the historical
development of industrialism. These goals are pursued within the
basic frameworks of space, time, and the formal attributes of
artifacts and the built environment.

What I have attempted to do here is to present a productive and
interesting structure for an archeological plan that may serve for
the next few decades. I have assessed the trends in the discipline
and have organized this discussion for general usefulness. In
addressing each topic I often describe the approach of some major
work(s) not necessarily confined to regional concerns in order to
provide a context for thinking about archeological data in the
Potomac Basin. Not all of the theoretical positions or approaches
I mention have been used in the mid-Atlantic and I wish to suggest
that they may be applied. I do not, however, seek to develop a
critique of mid-Atlantic archeology, as that would be an effort far
outside of the scope of this plan.

A Note on Time Notation

Conventional time notation of years as B.C. or A.D. is abandoned
here in favor of the theologically neutral BCE (Before Current
Era), which is equivalent to B.C., and CE (Current Era), which is
equivalent to A.D. Dates are often given as BP (Before Present).
For archeologists, "present" is defined as 1950 CE. Usually I have
simply added 2000 years to a BCE designation for an approximate
date BP.

Archeological Logic

Archeologists rely quite heavily upon the use of analogy in many
ways. Analogies may be made between the past and ethnographic,
historical, and current descriptions or models. They may be quite
specific, focusing on the function of a particular artifact, or
more general, concerning social strategies for dealing with scarce
resources.

Ethnographic analogy must be used with extreme caution, especially
since there are no ethnographically known societies for the vast
majority of human history. However, there is little else with
which one may begin to ask questions of the prehistoric past. The
discussion provides a general overview of the kinds of ideas drawn
from ethnographic knowledge and applied in archeological
reconstruction. I also include a caution about making simplistic
assumptions about "simple" hunter-gatherers and "complex" food
producers,

There is a long-standing bias in anthropology which associates a
society's means of subsistence with its cultural complexity,

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xx


=== Page 25 ===

assuming that complexity arrives with food production. However, an
increasingly sophisticated understanding of human cultures leads to
a rejection of an uncomplicated dichotomy between simple foragers
and complex farmers. In the mid-Atlantic region, the variability
of hunter-gatherer societies is an issue central to most of
prehistory since hunting-gathering remained the principle
subsistence strategy until the Late Woodland period. This
variability and complexity of groups prior to the full-scale
adoption of agriculture has yet to be adequately researched.

Chronology and Economy

Table II.2 (page 62) summarizes a few of the dates and time periods
used by archeologists in the mid-Atlantic region for pre- and
protohistoric periods.

Tables II.3, 11.4, I1.5, I1.6 and I1I.7 provide some of the
temporally diagnostic material culture styles recognized in the
mid-Atlantic. Table II.3 (page 65) lists formal styles of stone
points. Table II.4 (page 66) provides selected radiocarbon dates
for those point types. Table I1.5 (page 68) lists pre- and
protohistoric pottery types.

Tables II.6 (page 72) and II.7 (page 76) provide material used to
date historic sites; the first is a list by time period of common
material and the latter is a schematic of the manufacturing ranges
of some of the most frequently cited ceramic time markers.

One of the most intensely researched topics in North American
prehistory is the earliest human occupation, the Paleoindian
period. It is not simply time which veils the most ancient
American lives; it is also the strangeness of attempting to
understand completely new adaptations in an environment without any
modern counterpart. Analogies are limited not only for ecological
conditions but also for various components of behavior and culture
such as economy, mobility, and social interaction.

One of most significant conceptual shifts in Quaternary studies is
the relatively recent realization that Pleistocene biomes were not
at all like those of the present. There was a very rapid
reordering of vegetation across eastern North America about 10,000
years ago. By then, an essentially modern Holocene vegetation
association had replaced the late glacial mosaic forests.

There are important implications for human adaptation that have
come out of the refinement of environmental reconstruction. Many
text-books and traditional archeology describe Paleoindians as
"big-game hunters," assuming that mastodon and ancient bison
remains which are associated with Paleoindian artifacts in the
western United States must have been the preferred game in the east

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xxi


=== Page 26 ===

as well. Careful paleoenvironmental reconstruction at the Shawnee-
Minisink site in the Delaware Valley indicates that by the time
people occupied the area, the megafauna were already gone. Plant
and fish remains at the site suggest that Paleoindians were
generalized hunter-gatherers rather than big-game specialists.

The Archaic was characterized by generally modern (Holocene)
climatic conditions, although that is not to say that the landscape
suddenly looked like today's. There continued to be complex
changes. The ancient Susquehannah River, ancestral to the
Chesapeake Bay, began to be submerged by encroaching water about
10,000 years ago, but the infilling of the Bay was not complete
until about 5,000 years ago. The formation of the Potomac basin
then presented a slowly changing landscape to humans for thousands
of years. The major environmental change was the infilling of the
Chesapeake Bay and concomitant development of estuarine resources.
The first known use of shellfish is dated to about 4,000 years ago.

The Archaic period was so-named in the 19th century to designate an
outdated wandering way of life, a perception now itself outdated.
The period covers a long time and traditionally includes hunter-
gatherer lifeways during the Holocene. With a growing
understanding of the complexity of both hunting-gathering lifeways
and the development of agriculture, the definition of the period is
more nebulous. The end of the Archaic is usually marked by the
innovation of pottery, traditionally regarded as a Woodland period
trait. General trends of the Archaic have been traditionally
identified as population growth and greater dependence on food
gathering relative to hunting as well as the absence of
agriculture, ceramics, and settled village life. The definition of
Archaic lifeways continues to be refined by modern archeologists.

There is some fascinating recent evidence for subsistence and
material culture during the late Early Archaic and the Late Archaic
at the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line in Prince Georges
County, Maryland. Very good plant preservation and careful
analysis revealed an important botanical assemblage. Discovered
were fruits, tubers, starchy seeds, nuts, shoots and leaves with
seasonal availability in the spring, summer and fall. Tubers
represented over 80% of the taxa, while there were very few nuts.
Nearly all of the 37 charred plant species have documented
ethnographic uses. Such plants were used to medicate and
intoxicate, and for cordage, mats, baskets, decorative objects,
dyes, and shelter.

The transition between the Archaic and the Woodland period,
sometimes labeled as the Terminal Archaic (see Table II.2) or as
the Transitional, correlated with environmental change as the
Chesapeake Bay estuaries were formed and estuarine resources as
well as anadromous fish became available.

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xxii


=== Page 27 ===

This transitional period witnessed changes in every aspect of
archeologically-visible culture: site size, density and number;
technology, settlement, and subsistence. The major economic
changes were marked by the diagnostics of Savannah River and
Susquehanna broadspears, steatite bowls, and ceramics. A new,
riverine focus appeared all along the eastern United States and
there was also an increased subsistence focus on fishing and
probably on drying and storing fish. Evidence for trade in
steatite and other material indicates much broader regional
interaction.

Throughout the eastern United States archeologists have observed
general trends during the Late Archaic as people increasingly
focused their energy on riverine, estuarine, or lacustrine settings
and resources and developed more sedentary settlement systems.
Changes in natural environment and population pressure have been
the most commonly cited causes. A meaningful goal, though, is not
simply to attribute changes in human strategies to external causes,
but to address human choices and responses in the face of major
changes: response to new resource availability with different
organization of labor and production, storage and the distribution
of surplus; responses to decreased mobility and demographic changes
in terms of social authority and control.

Woodland period adaptations were achieved in a modern climate with
relatively minor fluctuations. Microenvironments could, of course,
vary between locales.

The characteristics of the Eastern Woodland period generally are
identified as population increase, increased sedentism, manufacture
and widespread use of pottery, domestication of native plants,
adoption of imported domesticates, and the development of elaborate
mortuary practices. The famous Adena and Hopewell interaction
networks centered in Ohio and Illinois did not directly or greatly
affect material culture of much of the mid-Atlantic, although trade
networks penetrated the Appalachians and the Delmarva peninsula. In
the mid-Atlantic, there was a seasonal hunting-gathering adaptation
through the Middle Woodland at least, although there may have been
some plant domestication as well. In the mid-Atlantic, as in other
parts of the eastern United States, many of the characteristics of
Woodland societies predated the development of agriculture.

Because they are the result of more sedentary populations, Woodland
sites tend to be internally complex, containing storage pits,
structure patterns, and burials. However, the Early Woodland is
not well known and there is little excavated data from the Middle
Woodland. Late Woodland sites are better documented.

A new kind of feature appeared during the Middle Woodland (and

likely earlier) to alter the cultural landscape. Burial mounds
were built in the Potomac Valley in Maryland and West Virginia and

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xxiil


=== Page 28 ===

the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The following issues are
connected with burial mounds: public symbolism; the _ social
integration of communities and dispersed settlements; and
territoriality. The appearance and disappearance of mounds also
may have accompanied the rise and fall of early ranked social
systems.

Territoriality, that is, the definition and control of an area by
people, is a factor which became important in the mid-Atlantic
during the Middle Woodland. For most of prehistory physiographic
regions did not mark significant cultural boundaries, but during
the Middle Woodland divergent cultural adaptations appeared in the
Coastal Plain and Piedmont. The cultural boundary along the Fall
Line between Algonquian speakers of the Coastal Plain and Siouan
speakers of the Piedmont may have been initially defined much
earlier in the Woodland, but it is certainly archeologically
identifiable by 1000 years ago.

Subsistence during the later part of the Late Woodland among the
Virginia Algonquians was based on the swidden farming of maize.
Beans, squash, pumpkins, gourds, sunflower and tobacco were also
grown. Corn contributed over half of the diet and was consumed by
at least part of the population throughout the year. Maize is
found throughout the mid-Atlantic by at least 1000 years ago and
was used intensively by 700-800 years ago.

The most apparent and major change during the Late Woodland in the
mid-Atlantic was the establishment of large villages with economies
based on maize agriculture. It was during the latter part of this
period that major changes in social and political organization
occurred concurrently with this reliance on imported crops.
Populations aggregated to form large, albeit often dispersed,
villages as territorial and social boundaries became increasingly
distinct and important. Evidence for intergroup and interregional
hostility increased after 1400. The development and dynamics of
chiefdoms and competition among them are some of the most
compelling research issues for archeology.

Once archeological attention turns to historically documented
periods, the whole tone of investigation changes in response to the
often rich and always biased data that are available. Oddly,
historical archeology tends to ask both more and less sophisticated
questions than prehistory; this dual tendency is due, in part, to
the difficult methodological issues of integrating, challenging, or
confirming documentary data in addition to archeological data.
Archeology of historic periods is neither easier nor superfluous,
but it does require a somewhat different orientation and
methodology than that of prehistory. Consequently, the section of
the overview concerning the historical period is arranged
differently from those preceding as it is assumed that the reader
is familiar with the basic trends of the historic period.

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xxiv


=== Page 29 ===

The tobacco economy characterized 17th and early 18th-century
European settlement in the Potomac Basin. The place of the English
colonies within the world economic system was that of an economic
periphery servicing the British economic core.

Tobacco and the trade and profit it engendered were major factors
in the dispersion of plantations and people along the deep,
navigable rivers of the Chesapeake drainage. The ease of water
transportation made it possible for trade to take place at
individual plantations and hampered the formation of towns and
cities. Large plantations, however, served many of the functions
of towns, including the location of crafts.

The variety and volume of domestic material at European American
sites tends to increase through time, with relatively little found
at 17th-century sites and more at 19th and 20th century sites.
Even wealthy settlers in the early years of the colonies did not
leave dense archeological deposits. The consumer revolution of the
18th century drastically changed the material world of the middle
class and this transformation is clearly visible archeologically.

Previous Survey and Predictive Models

This section provides a chronological listing of some of the major
professional survey within or adjacent to the Potomac Basin by
physiographic region. Many small surveys, particularly those which
have been undertaken for Section 106 compliance are not listed
here. Work that has been undertaken in the units of the National
Park Service within the National Capital Region is addressed in
Part III of this plan: Status of Archeological Inventory.

Archeological sites can be anywhere; they often are found in
unexpected places. Statistically, however, they are more likely to
be in certain environmental settings than in others. It is this
latter observation which fuels site predictive models. The former
observation stands as a caution against overreliance on such
models. Predictive site models rest on the assumption that there
are fairly regular patterns of human settlement for any particular
time period in a particular environment. These models begin with
a hypothesized pattern drawn from known site locations and
analogies with ethnographically-known societies. Confirmation is
then sought through site survey.

A "red flag model" may be useful in the management of sites. For
both land management and archeological needs, we need ways to
identify sites which do not fall within predicted locations. The
archeological value of such an approach is clear:

Sites in anomalous settings by definition must be the result
ef behaviours that do not fit current models of why

ABSTRACT/REGIONAL OVERVIEW xXV


=== Page 30 ===

prehistoric inhabitants settled where they did. Under any
definition, these sites must be significant, for they more
than any others have the potential of telling us something
about prehistory that was heretofore unknown [Altshul
1990:227-8].

With the understanding that predictive modeling should be
approached with flexibility, I summarize some of the models that
have been created from survey data for the different physiographic
areas of the Potomac basin.

Tables II,.11-II.14 summarize some of the predictive factors.

Archeological Issues

Throughout this overview, research topics in need of archeological
study are identified. Traditional archeological interests in
chronological control, subsistence, settlement pattern, and social
organization need to be further addressed for nearly all periods
throughout the Potomac Basin within frameworks of anthropological
and historical questions. Economy is suggested as a comprehensive
framework for forming and addressing questions for both the
prehistoric and historical past. Specific research issues, of
course, will be formulated for each particular project.

This section provides categories of issues and examples. Synopses

of parks in Section III of the plan also include some examples of
archeological issues.

INTRODUCTION
NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA

The National Capital Area (NCA), formerly the National Capital
Region (NCR), of the National Park Service encompasses Washington,
D.C. and environs within the drainage basin of the Potomac River
(Fig. I.1). From the Occoquan River in Prince William County,
Virginia to the source of the Potomac in Cumberland, Maryland to
the mighty confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac in Harpers
Ferry, West Virginia, the parks in this region contain rich and
diverse cultural and natural resources. Archeology within the
region has provided far-ranging insight into human lives, from the
earliest human immigration to the area 11-12,000 years ago, to the
devastation of Native American displacement, to the wreckage of the
Civil War, to industrial development.

Washington, D.C. is the city upon which the National Capital Area
focuses. Within the immediate metropolitan area are the Virginia
cities of Alexandria, Arlington, and Fairfax. The Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) of Washington, D.C. covers a much larger
area, extending from Prince William and Stafford counties, Virginia
to Frederick, Maryland (see Table I.1). Three other MSAs defined
by census figures affect parks and visitation. These are
Baltimore, Maryland; Hagerstown, Maryland; and Cumberland,
Maryland/West Virginia. The following counties encircle or adjoin
park lands: in Maryland: Anne Arundel, Charles, Montgomery,
Prince Georges, Frederick, Washington, and Allegeny; in Virginia:
Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William, and Loudoun counties and the
city of Alexandria; and in West Virginia: Jefferson, Morgan, and
Mineral.

Census figures from the past few decades reveal some important
trends for the parks of the National Capital Area. Higher
population, more visitation, and more visitor services all lead to
higher impact on the resources and the increased need for good
baseline data to inform management decisions about locating
services and designing interpretation. Knowledge of the location
and extent of archeological resources is an essential part of this
baseline data.

Table I.1 summarizes population statistics for the four MSAs and
central cities within the National Capital Area. Population growth
has been particularly heavy in the metropolitan rings over the last
few decades. Table I.2 summarizes recent demographic
characteristics of the National Capital Area. Such information may
help interpreters better understand their local audiences.

The purpose of this plan is to organize the state of our

archeological knowledge of the region and to define strategies for
identifying resources and discerning how they fit into our

understandings of our heritage. The administrative background for
its development is summarized below.

BACKGROUND OF THE SAIP PLAN
FOR THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AREA

The Systemwide Archeological Inventory Program (SAIP), also known
as the National Archeological Survey Initiative (NASI), was
established in response to the identification of a material
weakness in the Park Archeology Program, servicewide. The weakness
stems from the fact that there is inadequate knowledge of
archeological site location and therefore inadequate ability to
protect and preserve these cultural resources. The weakness
includes the following elements:

le Destruction or unacceptable damage to significant
archeological sites/structures from development, operations,
resources management, visitor use, vandalism or natural/human
disasters;

2. loss of significant and scientifically valuable artifacts due
to development, operations, resources management, visitor use,
vandalism or natural/human disasters;

3. loss of significant scientific knowledge due to destruction or
damage to archeological properties; and

4. failure of park and regional programs development and
execution to identify, prioritize, schedule and fund
archeological inventory, evaluation and data recovery actions
to prevent or mitigate the consequences of items 1 through 3,
above.

The impact of this material weakness on Department operations is
serious and long-term. The NPS is the lead Federal archeological
preservation agency. Its program must be executed in conformance
with the legislative and regulatory requirements for the
preservation and management of archeological resources. Failure to
do so results in the destruction and loss of significant scientific
knowledge and damages the Department's creditability as the lead
Federal Agency in the preservation, conservation and management of
archeological resources.

The emphases of the inventory program include 1) a research
orientation in keeping with the Vail Agenda (National Parks
Foundation 1992); 2) a regional focus; that is, projects may
involve several parks as well as projects within parks, and
priorities are defined regionally rather than by the Washington
Office; 3) the beginning of a process of restructuring archeology
and bringing cultural resources to the level of natural resources
in the parks in terms of training, funding, recognition, and
professionalism.

INTRODUCTION 5


=== Page 39 ===

The overall goal and objectives of SAIP are as follows (NPS
1992:2):

GOAL: Conduct systematic, scientific research to locate,
evaluate, and document archeological resources on
National Park System lands.

OBJECTIVES: 1. Determine the nature and extent of archeological
resources in park areas.

2. Record and evaluate those resources, including
nominating eligible properties for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.

3. Recommend appropriate strategies for conserving,
protecting, preserving in situ, managing, and
interpreting those resources.

Archeological survey and inventory of nearly all of the units
within the National Capital Area is insufficient to ensure that
archeological resources under NPS stewardship are conserved,
protected, preserved in situ and managed for long-term scientific
research and for appropriate public interpretation and education.
Information about the location, characteristics and significance of
the majority of archeological resources is lacking. This lack of
information seriously impairs the ability of park managers,
planners, interpreters, law enforcement officers and other
specialists to carry out their responsibilities.

To meet the goal and objectives of SAIP, the following should be
accomplished for each park unit:

1) overview and assessment of existing information, including
literature and collections, on prehistoric and historic
resources;

2) a field survey and Phase II test excavations to locate,
identify, evaluate, and document archeological resources using
the criteria of significance established by the National
Register of Historic Places;

3) appropriate analysis of the data;

4) artifact processing, cataloging, stabilization, and curation;

5) updating and maintenance of appropriate records, including the
Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS) and
a Geographic Information System (GIS) archeological data base;

6) report preparation; printing, and distribution;

INTRODUCTION 9


=== Page 40 ===

7) public outreach and education.

Documents to be produced include Archeological Overview and
Assessments, and Archeological Identification and Evaluation
Studies. These documents, including an archeological base map,
will provide information needed by park managers, planners,
interpreters, law enforcement officers and other specialists to
effectively carry out their responsibilities for the protection and
interpretation of archeological resources.

The survey and inventory will partially fulfill certain
requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act, Executive
Order 11593 (Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment), the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and NPS-
28, Cultural Resource Management Guideline.

The Systemwide program requirements and standards and the factors
for priority ranking of projects are specified and explained in the
SAIP document (NPS 1992). The requirements and standards are listed
below. The priority ranking factors are discussed in section VI of
this plan.

There are four systemwide requirements:

I. Archeological inventory activities are focused on areas within
the National Park System.

2. Archeological inventory activities are focused on systematic
research to locate, identify, evaluate, and document
archeological resources.

3. As appropriate, the full sequence of necessary activities are
planned, programmed, and undertaken in an archeological
inventory project.

4. All appropriate and available NPS and non-NPS sources of
funds, equipment, services, and personnel are used to
undertake archeological inventories and to develop regionwide
archeological survey plans.

There are ten systemwide standards:

2. Archeological inventory projects meet the requirements of the
NPS's policies, guidelines, and standards.

Z« Archeological inventory projects are conducted in accordance
with a written, fully professional research design, approved
by the regional office.

3. Archeological inventory projects are conducted using efficient
and effective advanced technologies.

4. Archeological inventory projects are developed and implemented
in cooperation with the appropriate State Historic
Preservation Officers.

5. Archeological inventory projects are developed and implemented
in consultation with appropriate Indian tribes and other
contemporary native groups and ethnic populations.

INTRODUCTION 10


=== Page 41 ===

10.

Since evidence of past cultural systems extend beyond the
boundaries of federally-owned or controlled lands and waters
in National Park System area, whenever possible, archeological
inventory projects collect and consider data from non-Federal
lands and waters within park areas as well as from adjoining
lands and waters.

Development and implementation of archeological inventory
projects involve non-NPS archeologists and other specialists
who have demonstrated competence in a particular culture,
geographic region, park area, or advanced technology.

Data collected during archeological inventory projects are
provided to park planners for incorporation, as appropriate,
into park planning documents, and to park managers for
resource managements, law enforcement, interpretation,
maintenance, and other park operational purposes.
Archeological data collected during inventory projects are
incorporated into Servicewide inventories, lists, catalogs,
and databases.

The results of archeological inventory projects are made
available, as appropriate, to the professional community and
to the public.

For further information on the Systemwide Archeological Inventory
Program, the reader is directed to the NPS document produced by the

Anthropology Division, Systemwide Arc ogical Inventory Pr
(NPS 1992). Each park superintendent was provided with a copy of
this document. Additional copies may be obtained from the

Anthropology Division, National Park Service, P.O, 37127,
Washington, DC 20013-7127.

PARK LOCATIONS AND ACCESSIBILITY

Many of the park units within the National Capital Area are in an
urban or suburban setting and most are easily accessible by public
roads. There are some areas of a few parks, such as Prince William
Forest Park and the C&O Canal NHP, which are remote. Location and
accessibility is summarized in Table I.3.

LAND OWNERSHIP AND
NEIGHBORING PUBLIC LANDHOLDINGS

Land Ownership is summarized in Table I.3 as are neighboring public
landholdings.

There are numerous lands held by federal, state, and local
government entities other than NPS within the National Capital
Area. Table I.4 summarizes the state-owned land. There are also
many federally-owned parcels of land. Some large parcels are
outside the area but are close enough to be of archeological
interest. For example, the George Washington National Forest of
over one million acres is located in the Blue Ridge of Virginia and
West Virginia. Both the Shenandoah National Park and the Mason
Neck National Wildlife Refuge are located in the Virginia Blue
Ridge.

Near the George Washington Memorial Parkway is Fort Myer and
Arlington National Cemetery, Washington National Airport, the
Dalecarlia Reservoir (Corps of Engineers), the University of the
District of Columbia, Potomac Overlook Regional Park, Alexandria
Four Mile Run Park, and other parks in Alexandria and Arlington
County, Virginia.

Near Rock Creek Park is the National Zoo, the Walter Reed Medical
Center, the U. S. Naval Observatory, and the Naval Security Station
as well as Maryland Rock Creek Park.

National Capital Parks - Central and National Capital Parks - East
are near many other parcels of publically owned land, including
that owned by the city of Washington. Near Anacostia Park are
Maryland Anacostia River Park, Fort Lincoln New Town, the National
Arboretum, and the Washington Navy Yard. Also near NPS land are
the U.S. Capitol and grounds, the U.S. Naval Station. Bolling AFB,
Naval Research Lab, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Fort McNair on the
Washington Channel and numerous federal buildings along the
National Mall.

NATURE OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

It is water, not politics, that unifies
portions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland, and all of the District of
Columbia.

ICPRB 1986:3

The Potomac River, with a network of over 100 tributaries, is the
principal waterway that drains 14,670 square miles. The basin of
"The Nation's River" includes mountains, ridges, and highlands to
form a natural drainage area. The Potomac basin is small compared
with some others in the United States, but it is nearly unique in
terms of its variability as it traverses five distinctive
physiographic districts, starting as a trickle in West Virginia,
traveling 383 miles to meet the Chesapeake Bay where its mouth is
10 miles wide (ICPRB 1986). This section of the plan is devoted to
a brief description of the land which the Potomac drains and upon
which the basin's inhabitants, from the earliest scattered bands to
the current four million individuals, have lived their lives.

There are three sharply defined physiographic zones in the eastern
United States paralleling the Atlantic shore from New England
almost to the Gulf of Mexico. These are the Coastal Plain,
Piedmont Plateau, and the Appalachian Province. The latter has
three divisions: 1) the Blue Ridge district; 2) the Greater
Appalachian Valley including the Great Valley (Hagerstown Valley in
Maryland and Shenandoah Valley in Virginia) and the Allegheny
ridges; and 3) the Allegheny Plateau (Vokes and Edwards 1974).

Figure I.2 shows the boundaries of these zones within the Potomac
basin. Table I.5 shows the locations of parks or portions of parks
in major physiographic regions.

Climatic conditions and even the physical characteristics of the
land have changed over the past 12,000 years, presenting
inhabitants with variable conditions. Each physiographic region
exhibits some difference not only in topography but also in
available food resources and raw materials such as stone and clay.
For example, the Coastal Plain estuaries provided abundant fish,
shellfish, and migratory birds before extensive environmental
degradation affected those populations. Until tobacco cultivation
and soil runoff began to silt up the rivers and streams, water
transportation provided a means of considerable mobility on the
Coastal Plain. The Fall Line which separates the higher Piedmont
from the Coastal Plain has been an important location for
exploiting anadromous fish runs. Among the many important stone
resources available in the Piedmont and along the Fall Line is
steatite. This material was carved into vessels and crushed for
temper for the earliest ceramics in the region. The Blue Ridge, the
Ridges and Valleys, and the Plateau of the Appalachian province

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 23


=== Page 54 ===

contain much greater topographic relief and higher elevations than
the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. The stone resource rhyolite,
important in prehistoric mid-Atlantic trading networks, is found in
the Blue Ridge. Coal deposits and natural gas fields in the
Allegheny Plateau spurred intensive settlement during the 19th
century.

Different resources available in different locations spur people to
invent various ways of obtaining the materials they need or want.
The boundaries of physiographic provinces or other aspects of the
natural landscape may or may not act as social barriers.
Migration, seasonal movement, trade, and hostility may flow back
and forth, defined by history and cultural circumstance. For
example, the Fall Line did not act as a cultural boundary until
Woodland times.

Understanding human action within the context of the natural and
social environment is an important goal of archeology. Therefore
it is critical to archeological analysis and the public
interpretation of its findings that both natural and cultural
resources be considered.

Two sections follow. The first is a brief discussion of
environmental parameters and constraints before modern conditions.
The second is a more detailed, geographic description of the
physiographic provinces within the Potomac Basin. It is provided
here not only because such information is sometimes difficult to
find, but also because it provides the interpretive staff in each
park an idea of that park's natural setting in relation to other
parks in the region. Because there has been traffic for thousands
of years between these areas, it also provides some sense of the
different circumstances people confronted prehistorically and
historically.

Environmental Parameters and Constraints

The overall environment in which humans operate is a complex
interweaving of physical and social surroundings including
perceptions, historical consciousness and future plans; and ideas
and beliefs about metaphysical surroundings. In researching
prehistoric environmental contexts, archeology generally is able to
address only physical and social surroundings, and those with
varying degrees of success. Interpretations of historical time
periods often have the advantage of contemporary accounts of social
and religious beliefs as well as observations on physical
surroundings. Human participation in ecosystems must take into
account other human groups, including the residue left behind by
those already past. Except for the earliest inhabitants, all human
societies live in surroundings somehow influenced by earlier human
beings.

Much attention in archeology has been focused on physical
environment partly due to the legacy of theoretical orientations
such as environmental determinism and cultural ecology. Clearly,
people live in a natural world and have to adapt to their
surroundings. However, relatively little about human societies can
be said to be environmentally determined in a strict sense.
Although the physical environment provides both possibilities and
limitations, these are always filtered through human technology,
demography, cultural expectations and priorities, and other human
needs.

In addition to amassing data to understand the natural world to
which past people adapted, there is another reason _ for
reconstructing environmental conditions. This second goal is to
understand changing conditions so that archeological sites may be
properly interpreted. Site formation and the effects on sites of
natural processes such as erosion, alluvial and colluvial deposits,
and chemical disintegration are important.

The form of the landscape itself is affected by changes in
precipitation, prevailing winds, and river response to these as
well as sea level changes. Dennis Curry and Carol Ebright (1989)
and Ebright (1992; personal communication) describe large scale
dissection of the Coastal Plain during the Holocene. Floodplains
occupied by Paleoindian and Archaic people may today be situated on
upland ridgetops due to this geological process. In addition to
such large scale topographic changes are small scale changes on
sites due to variable aeolian and alluvial affects on site burial,
erosion, and deflation. In other words, archeological sites are
transformed by many natural processes after material is deposited.
Archeologists rarely encounter the "Pompeii effect" wherein a site
is frozen in time with relatively unambiguous clues to people's
activities.

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 27


=== Page 58 ===

The physical environment consists of more than climate, plants, and
animals. The location, type, and quality of water; the quality of
soil; and ambient sunshine are among those factors humans consider
important about the physical environment. Raw materials such as
stone, wood, and clay are crucial and the distribution of these
affect the way people move across the landscape. It cannot be
overemphasized that microenvironments, that is, small-scale
environmental characteristics, affect specific site location and
the duration of occupation.

The reconstruction of past ecosystems is a difficult but necessary
task for understanding prehistoric and historic human adaptation.
It is a major archeological issue especially for earlier periods,
but it is always necessary to understand both general environment
and microenvironment, even’in recent historic contexts. The basic
data are generally derived from soils, floral and faunal remains,
pollen cores, and opal phytoliths (the crystallized remains of
plant cells).

Victor Carbone's (1976) reconstruction of the paleoenvironment from
data in the Shenandoah Valley has been one of the most widely cited
sources by archeologists for interpreting past Potomac Basin
climate and biomes. His data have often been extrapolated to
inappropriate areas such as the Coastal Plain (Ebright, personal
communication). Jeffrey Hantman (1989) reminds us that, although
Carbone's work in the 1970s set a standard for paleoenvironmental
reconstruction, there are more recent data and syntheses which
should be incorporated into our interpretations of early
adaptations.

Several researchers have addressed prehistoric climate, hydrology,
geomorphology, and vegetation including COHMAP (1988), Steven
Colman and Jeffrey Halka (1989a,b), Leonard Eisenberg (1978), John
Guilday (1984), Arthur Joyce (1988), J. C, Knox (1983), John Kraft
(1985), and J. McDonald and S. Bird (1986).

Hazel Delcourt and Paul Delcourt (1981, 1986, 1987, 1991), for
example, have synthesized vegetation types in the Eastern United
States since the last Ice Age. They provide a set of five
paleovegetation and paleoclimatic maps from 18,000 BP to 500 BP.
Modern pollen rain was characterized for major vegetational types
so that paleovegetation could be classified. Climate was then
inferred from vegetational data (Delcourt and Delcourt 1987).
Table I.6 is a synopsis of the latter four maps.

The Pacific Airmass of dry
prevailing westerlies was the
dominant airmass affecting
climate.

In this area, the Polar Frontal
Zone separates northern subpolar
climates from southern temperate
climates, “This climatic
transition zone is characterized
by several months of Arctic Air
influence during the late winter
and spring, followed by
incursions of the Maritime
Tropical Airmass bringing
moisture in summer, and the
Pacific Airmass dominating
seasonally from autumn through

Arctic Airmass, resulting in
episodes of extreme winter cold
«-~ kilt all but the most cold

species" (1987:100).

The Maritime Tropical Airmass
provided moisture through the
Spring and summer. The Pacific
Airmass and the southern
anticyclone has a comparatively
weak influence in the fall and
winter. “The southeastern
evergreen forest regton is under
the influence of the Maritime
Tropical Airmass nearly
throughout the year and receives
substantial moisture from both
tropical depressions and
hurricanes" (1987: 100)

The Maritime Tropical air mass

Tundra existed north of the
National Capital section of the
mid-Atlantic in much of what is
now Pennsylvania and New York,
Boreal Forest characterized the
area south of Pennsylvania
approximately to the Carolinas.

The ice sheet had retreated to
Ontario and southeastern Quebec
and Labrador. Worthern
Pennsylvania and New York were
still in Boreal Forest. Much of
the Wational Capital area was
occupied by 4 mixed conifer-
northern hardwoods forest.

In the southern ond western
portions of Virginia there was
deciduous forest.

The ice sheet disappeared and
the boreal forest retreated to
Canada's maritime provinces.
Most of Maryland, Virginta, and
West Virginia were in deciduous
forest. The Delmarva peninsula
(net then a peninsula) and
southeastern Virginio were in
southeastern evergreen forest.

ALL of Maryland, all of Virginia
except the westernmost portion,
and the eastern edge of West
Virginia were characterized by
southeastern evergreen forest.



=== Page 60 ===

Such reconstructions continue to be refined and need to be done for
localized areas. Joyce (1988) emphasizes that there is a trend in
paleoecology toward understanding continuous change in the
environment rather than focusing on episodes of climate. This
development will affect archeological interpretations of human
reaction to ecological factors.

One archeological (and paleoecological) problem is that of
describing microenvironments within broad environmental
reconstructions. To the human inhabitant, the environment is
confronted on a human scale. It is a challenge to recognize the
small-scale affects of broad change and fluctuations in past
environments.

Another issue in reconstructing environments is one of
compatibility and analogy to modern environments. For example, is
what ways is what we would call a boreal forest today similar or
dissimilar to a forest 10,000 years ago, which may also be labeled
as boreal? In some cases there are no good modern analogues for
some forest communities (Delcourt and Delcourt 1987:89).

An Overview of Chesapeake area climate during the past 10,000 years

Grace Brush (1986), a noted palynologist in the mid-Atlantic,
summarizes the geologic and climatic history of the Chesapeake Bay
area. Her climatic data consist of the pollen and seeds of
terrestrial and aquatic plants, diatoms, chlorophyll, charcoal, and
metals present in sediments. The following summary is taken from
her work,

The lower sea levels during the Pleistocene are important for
archeology because greater land masses were exposed and available
for human use. Consequently, many sites formed prior to 5,000 BP
are now underwater.

The Chesapeake Bay is the latest of several estuaries in the region
over the last several million years. At 10,000 BP ocean waters
began to flood the mouth of the old Susquehanna River, that is,
what is now the mouth of the bay. Sea level rose approximately 0.2
cm/yr. At 8,000 BP the head of the Bay was at Smith Island; 5,000
BP the head of the Bay was at Annapolis; 3,000 BP the head was at
the mouth of the Sassafras River. About 3,000 BP the rate of sea
level rise began to decline te 0.12 cm/yr and the Bay reached its
present configuration, which is probably its maximum extent.

The climatic history is constructed with radiocarbon-dated
sediments. At 15,000 BP (13,000 BCE) the pollen of spruce, pine,
and fir with some birch and alder indicates a climate 3-8 degrees
colder than the present. At 10,000 BP (8,000 BCE) oak became

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 30


=== Page 61 ===

abundant, temperatures increased, followed by an increase in
hemlock and hickory. At 5,000 BP (3,000 BCE) there was modern
vegetation but abundances fluctuated with climatic variation.

A continuous record for 4,000 years from Magothy River pollen cores
shows major shifts in wet and dry periods. For 1,300 years from
2,750-1,450 BCE (4,750-3,450 BP) the forest was dominated by black
gum and sweet gum with river birch and ferns, indicating a wet
climate. The great abundance of pollen may indicate more and
larger trees and high biomass production. There is a sharp drop
off of these dominant trees after 1,450 BCE. From 400 until 1,600
CE there are more dry plants such as holly, chestnut, and
ericateous shrubs. From 40 - 1,700 CE there are significant
oscillations in abundance of dry taxa. For example, from 400-500
CE and 1,000-1,200 CE holly and chestnut more abundant than in
intervening or subsequent periods. A core from the Nanticoke River
indicates a pronounced dry period from 1,000-1,200 CE when there is
a high ratio of dry (oak, hickory, pine) to wet (river birch, sweet
gum, black gum) taxa. Sediments indicate that this dry period was
characterized by intermittent fires.

Over the last 200 years records from Philadelphia indicate that
precipitation has been high from the mid-1800s to the late 1800s
and dry from the late 1800s to about 1940. Brush notes the great
effect of European populations on the Bay. Human effects include
increased siltation from erosion with intensified land use;
nutrients from fertilizers and sewage; toxic materials; and the
alteration of wetlands areas by channelization and dam building for
reservoirs.

It is important to acknowledge that humans have had impact on the

natural environment before the historical period. Delcourt and

Delcourt (1991:87) summarize fundamental affects of human activity

on vegetation over the last 10,000 years. The evidence to support

these interpretations comes from the archeological and

paleoecological record in eastern North America. They summarize:
Prehistoric Native Americans (1) changed the dominance
structure within forest communities... (2) extended or
truncated the distributional ranges of both woody and
herbaceous plant species... (3) provided disturbed open areas
including agricultural old-fields into which native ruderals
invaded and subsequently became weeds... and (4) changed the
proportion of forested to non-forested land through time,
progressively creating a culturally maintained landscape
mosaic.

Further environmental details are provided for each time period in
the chronological overview below. Following is some further
information on the geography of the Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and
Appalachian physiographic provinces.

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 31


=== Page 62 ===

Coastal Plain

‘

The Coastal Plain is the terrestrial section of the larger Atlantic
Plain which also includes the submerged Continental Shelf. A series
of southeastern dipping layers of largely unconsolidated sand and
Clay with some gravel is superimposed on the continuation of
crystalline Piedmont rocks. This Coastal Plain slopes gently at
about 2-4 ft per mile, although the gradient tends to be steeper
inland. Where the land surface lies above stream grade it is
dissected into gently sloping hills. The Coastal Plain is often
divided into the Inner Coastal Plain and the Outer Coastal Plain,
based on the limits of tidal action in streams and rivers. The
embayed section of the Coastal Plain is deeply endented by bays or
estuaries. From the Hudson to the Potomac this lowland ranges from
5 to 20 miles wide and abuts in places with the steep slope of the
Piedmont. From the Delaware to the James, major rivers are offset
at the Fall Line between the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont. That
is, when the rivers reach the Coastal Plain they turn and follow
its inner edge before crossing to the ocean. The Potomac, for
example, turns south at Little Falls and hugs the bluffs until,
about 40 miles south of Washington, it turns east again (Fennemen
1938).

The surface of the Coastal Plain is terraced south of the glacial
border. While geologists do not agree about the origins of the
terraces, they generally agree that the oldest gravels, the
Brandywine terrace, were deposited by freshwater streams and that
those of the youngest, the Talbot, are of marine origin. The
highest and oldest terraces are adjacent to the Piedmont. Harold
Vokes and Jonathan Edwards (1974) describe a series of four. The
Brandywine, between 200-300 ft asl, probably deposited by the
ancient Potomac River, has a maximum thickness of about 40 ft. It
consists of well-rounded pebbles of erosion-resistant rock-like
quartzite, hard sandstone, and chert fossiliferous pebbles. Three
terraces date from interglacial intervals. The oldest of these is
the Sunderland, from 90-200 ft asl, forming the upland in southern
Charles and most of St. Marys and Calvert counties. The Wicomico,
from 45 to 90 ft asl, is most extensive on eastern shore and is
only scattered on the western shore. The Talbot or Pamlico is from
10-45 ft asl and is widely developed on eastern shore. On the
western shore it is developed along the Potomac in Charles and St.
Marys counties, from the lowlands of the Patuxent River from Upper
Marlboro to its mouth; along Chesapeake Bay between Point Lookout
in St. Marys County and Cove Point in Calvert County and from Deale
to the mouth of the Susquehanna.

The boundary between the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont is ill-
defined as the softer unconsolidated Cretaceous formations overlay
the southeastern sloping hard crystalline Piedmont rocks. The
boundary is clear in stream valleys where the erosion of softer
formations has created dramatic rapids and waterfalls over the

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 32


=== Page 63 ===

crystalline rocks at the eastern edge of the Piedmont. The
boundary is called the Fall Line due to this unmistakable
characteristic. At Great Falls, for example, the Potomac plunges
about 100 ft as its form changes from a broad, shallow, placid
river in a wide valley to a narrow, deep, swift river in a steep,
rocky gorge (Fisher 1971).

Streams in the Coastal Plain flow sluggishly, winding their way to
the Bay. The limit of navigability has been moved downstream
significantly due to siltation. Bladensburg, Maryland was once a
port for ocean-going vessels as was Dumfries in Prince William
County, Virginia and Elkridge Landing on the Patapsco west of
Baltimore.

Coastal Plain soils tend to be sandy or silty with a very light to
medium texture. They are well-drained except in low-lying lands
with a high water table or where hard-pan has been developed. They
are usually acidic and, in modern times, need the application of
lime to be agriculturally productive (Vokes and Edwards 1974:137).

On the Coastal Plain pines are the most abundant tree. Virginia
Pines and scrub oak are dominant secondary growth; pre-European
forests would have had much more diversity (Ebright, personal
communication). A distinct swamp hardwood forest consists of pine,
willow, swamp oaks, red and black gums, red maple, river birch,
yellow poplar, sycamore, beech and walnut (Vokes and Edwards
1974:168).

Regarding the fauna witnessed by early European settlers, "A

Relation of Maryland" published in London in 1635 reported:
The woods are free from underwood, so that a man may travell
on horseback almost anywhere...In the upper parts of the
countrie there are bufaloes, elkes, lions, bears, wolves. And
deare there are in great store, in all places that are not
much frequented, as also beavers, foxes, otters and many other
sortes of beastes. Of birds, there is the eagle, goshawk,
falcon, lanner, sparrow-hawk and merlin; also wild turkeys in
great aboundance, whereof many weigh fifty pounds and upwards,
and of partridge plenty. There are likewise sundry sorts of
birds which sing, whereof some are red, some blew, others
blacke and yellow, some like our blackebirds, others like
thrushes, but not of the same kind, with many more for which
we know no names [quoted in Vokes and Edwards 1974:174].

Lithic resources available on the Coastal Plain are limited to
secondary sources. Cobbles and gravels in stream beds include
jaspers, cherts, and other cryptocrystallines as well as quartz.
In the Outer Coastal Plain, available cobbles are larger
downstream. From Nomini Bay to the Chesapeake there tend to be
cobbles larger than about 4 inches in diameter of quartz and
quartzite and less chert and yellow jasper. Smaller cobbles of 1

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 33


=== Page 64 ===

to 4 inches are present from Mathias Point to Nomini Bay (Bromberg
1987:34-42).

Mineral resources in the unconsolidated deposits of the Coastal
Plain include iron ore and clay, including red hematitic clays
mined as "paint ores." Iron ore was recognized by John Smith and
was used for local needs as early as 1681. Brick clay, pottery
clay and kaolin are available in different localities. Other
minerals exploited in the historic period include gold and chromium
(Vokes and Edwards 1974; Ebright, personal communication).

Piedmont

The seaward boundary of the Piedmont physiographic zone is the Fall
Line, which is generally only a few miles wide. North of the
Potomac, the steeper element of the stream profile has receded
upstream often. The Susquehanna falls 80 ft in 12 miles and
reaches tidewater at Port Deposit, Maryland 3 miles back from the
edge of the Piedmont. The Potomac falls 40 ft in 3 miles,
beginning 10 miles above Washington, DC. For the most part the
slope of the Fall Line does not exceed 30 ft per mile but in
Washington, DC it exceeds 100 ft per mile. South of the Potomac
falls have receded little. For example, the Rappahannock drops 40-
50 ft in 2 miles and reaches the tidewater at Fredericksburg where
crystalline rocks are exposed. The James falls 84 ft in 3 miles,
ending at Richmond. For most of the area south of the Potomac, the
edge of the Piedmont is not a strongly marked topographic feature
(Fennemen 1938:128-129).

The Piedmont is characterized by a broad undulating surface with
low knobs and ridges and numerous incised deep and narrow stream
valleys. Low hills increase in elevation from the Fall Line west
and culminate in Parrs Ridge, which rises several hundred feet with
an average elevation of 800-900 ft. Parrs Ridge attains 1100 ft in
northern Carroll County and southern Pennsylvania, but declines
southward to lowland heights at the Potomac River. Parrs Ridge
forms the divide between streams flowing into the Chesapeake Bay
and those that flow into the Potomac, dividing the Piedmont into
eastern and western geologic divisions. The Eastern Piedmont is
underlain by a complex series of metamorphosed rocks (gneiss,
slate, phyllite, schist, marble, serpentine, granite, gabbro). The
varied erosion-resistance of these rocks gives rise to a highly
diversified topography. Streams in the Eastern Piedmont have steep
gradients with rapids and small waterfalls (Vokes and Edwards
1974:56). This Eastern district, also known as the Piedmont
uplands, is the largest part of the province and is drained by the
Potomac River.

The Western district, or Piedmont lowlands, is underlain in the
eastern part by rocks similar to those in the Eastern Piedmont but

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 34


=== Page 65 ===

less strongly metamorphosed. Within the western district is the
valley of Frederick County, which is underlain by Cambro-Ordovician
limestone. Over this folded base lie red Triassic sandstones,
shales, siltstones of Newark group. Most of the drainage of the
Western Piedmont is by the Monocacy River.

Streams in the Piedmont tend to run in narrow valleys with steep
banks. Their long and winding courses crosscut geological
formations rather than follow them. Streams in both the Piedmont
and Appalachian have fairly steep slopes and rocky beds with
numerous rapids and gorges. In the Piedmont, pore space available
for ground water in recrystallized metamorphosed rock is very
small; therefore the only openings through which water may move are
joints and other fractures. As a result the amount of water from
wells in Piedmont depends on local conditions, especially the
fracturing and openness of rock (Vokes and Edwards 1974).

Although different formations in both the Piedmont and Appalachian
provinces create different soil types, some generalization is
possible (Vokes and Edwards 1974). Residual soils developed on
limestone terraces especially in the Frederick and Hagerstown
valleys tend to be of medium to heavy texture, slightly acidic and
moderately permeable. Usually subsurface drainage is good.
Residual soils developed on acid schists, gneisses, phyllites, and
metabasalts of Piedmont are of medium textures, slightly to
moderately acidic, moderately permeable, easily tilled, and with
high natural fertility. On slopes soil tends to be shallow,
gravelly to shaly, and subject to droughtiness. Residual soils on
serpentine tend to be dark brown with yellowish brown clayey
subsoil that becomes hard and intractable when dry and relatively
impermeable when wet. Surface drainage tends to be strong and
therefore erosion is often a problem. Residual soils of gabbros,

locally "red lands," are heavily textured, moderately permeable,
and have high natural fertility. These soils may be surprisingly
deep. Soil developed on red sandstones of Triassic strata of

Frederick Valley and of Upper Devonian Hampshire formation in
western Washington, Allegeny and Garrett counties is of a deep
reddish brown color. While the surface may be grayish to yellowish
brown, subsoils always have the characteristic deeper tint. The
texture is light except where shales are, then it is moderately
heavy. Permeability and drainage are good except over shales and
acidity is high (Vokes and Edwards 1974). The soils in karst areas
of the Hagerstown Valley are typically red "terra rossas." Karst
geology has implications for settlement patterns due to associated
springs, karst ponds, odd drainage patterns, and dry sinkholes and
caverns (Ebright, personal communication).

Vegetation associations correlate well with geology due to the
nature of soil formation. The major separation in the Piedmont is
between wet bottomland and dry upland assemblages. The bottomlands
support a sycamore-green ash-box elder-silver maple association

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 35


=== Page 66 ===

with red maple, white oak, flowering dogwood, grape and black
cherry, and black walnut. River birch is rare except along the
Potomac where river birch and sycamore grow along the floodplain
into the Appalachian province. The Upland forests contain a
chestnut-oak association with black cherry, pignut hickory, and
sassafras over a subcanopy of serviceberries, blueberries, and
American Chestnut (Wesler et al. 1981:Vol.3:11).

The crystalline rocks of Piedmont include granite, gneiss, gabbro,
serpentine, marble and slate. Soapstone (talc and steatite) is
found in Carroll, Harford, and Montgomery counties. Mica is
abundant in the eastern Piedmont (Vokes and Edwards 1974:128-129).
Prehistorically, the most important lithic outcrops were of quartz,
steatite, and talc. Cobbles and pebbles provide secondary sources
of lithic raw materials in most of the eastern Piedmont. Material
available from cobbles includes rhyolite, chert, jasper, quartzite,
quartz and sandstone (Barse 1982:4).

Mineral resources include 1) iron mineral pigments such as yellow
ochre; 2) gold and silver; 3) copper; 4) lead and zinc; 5)
chromium; and 6) manganese, molybdenum, and titanium. Quarries in
the historic period were operated for granite, gneiss, gabbro,
marble and limestone, limestone breccia, serpentine, quartzite,
sandstone and slate. In the later 18th century brown iron ores were
found in the Piedmont and Appalachian provinces and furnaces were
erected, Available clays include common brick clay in the
weathered shales of the Piedmont and Appalachian and ball clay
(Vokes and Edwards 1974).

Appalachian Physiographic Province

The Appalachian province is split into three divisions: the Blue
Ridge district; the Greater Appalachian Valley with the Great
Valley and Allegheny ridges; and the Allegheny Plateau. A few
observations about the province as a whole precedes those on the
individual divisions. The discussion of soils in the previous
section is applicable here and will not be repeated.

Streams, as noted for the Piedmont, have fairly steep slopes and
rocky beds. In the Blue Ridge, most streams are tributaries of
larger streams in the Piedmont or in the Ridge and Valley province.
All streamflow in the basin from west of the Blue Ridge flows
through the gap at Harpers Ferry (ICPRB 1986). Numerous rapids
and gorges were used early by European settlers for grain and
cotton mills.

The relatively small amount of pine in the Piedmont and Appalachian
is mostly Virginia Pine, except in the western part of Appalachian
where there are stands of mixed hardwoods and white pine and some
pure stands of white pine. In western Maryland the ridges support

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 36


=== Page 67 ===

scarlet oak and chestnut oak, mixed with pines. On the upper
slopes are black, white, chestnut and scarlet oaks; the lower
slopes are in white and red oak, hickory, and tulip trees. Bottoms
support ash, elm, maple, willow, sycamore, with white and red oak,
hickory, and walnut. Before the Chestnut blight, Chestnut was
dominant tree over much of the state, especially in South Mountain
and Catoctin Mountain where forests were about half chestnut (Vokes
and Edwards 1974).

As in the Piedmont, the major separation in vegetation is between
wet bottomland and dry upland forests. In the lower elevations
bottomlands support a sycamore-green ash-box elder association
while higher elevation bottomlands support hemlock-birch forests.
On the Potomac floodplain a river birch-sycamore association
extends from the Piedmont west to Allegeny county. In the uplands
chestnut-oak is associated with drier soils and sugar maple-bass
with wetter soils (Wesler et al. 1981:Vol.4).

Washington County, Maryland is a transition zone between
Alleghenian and Carolinian faunas. Maryland in general has more
northern than southern fauna with a few distinctly southern species
such as the southeastern shrew, harvest mouse, and spotted skunk
(Wesler et al. 1981:Vol.4)

The lithics useful to prehistoric populations available in the
Appalachian province in western Maryland include rhyolites, which
are most widely developed on the western side of the Middletown
Valley in the Blue Ridge; Weverton quartzite, which outcrops at
the crests of Catoctin and South Mountains; chert, which is
abundant in the Hagerstown Valley dolomite formations, and the
Keyser limestones and the Shriver formations near Cumberland
(Wesler et al. 1981:Vol.4)

Blue Ridge District. The Blue Ridge is a belt of mountains 8-10
miles wide in the Potomac basin west of the Piedmont. North of the
Potomac River there are crystalline rocks in the mountains and
softer rocks in the adjacent Piedmont. From the Susquehanna to
Roanoke the mountains form a narrow strip 12 to 14 miles wide of
rounded knobs of varying altitudes. The only well-defined axial
crest is near the Potomac where the belt contains three definite
parallel ridges. The altitude of the Blue Ridge is about 2000 ft
at the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, declining to 1200-1300 ft
before the Potomac. There is a broad sag in the summit levels near
the Potomac; about 7 miles south of the river altitudes rise to
1500 ft and increase slowly and irregularly to the south, ranging
up to 4000 ft (Fenneman 1938:164-186).

The Catoctin and Blue Ridge (or South) mountains unite to form the

greater highland of South Mountain in southern Pennsylvania. The
eastern border in Maryland is Catoctin Mountain, which forms an

I, PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 37


=== Page 68 ===

unbroken ridge from Pennsylvania to the Potomac River at Point of
Rocks. West of the ridge is Middletown Valley, which drains to the
Potomac through Catoctin Creek, The western side is South Mountain.
The Blue Ridge proper extends from Pennsylvania's South Mountain to
the Potomac River at Weverton. Virginia's Blue Ridge is not a
direct continuation of the Blue Ridge but continues the Elk Ridge,
which joins the South Mountain of Maryland on the west and reaches
the Potomac at Harpers Ferry (Vokes and Edwards 1974:69).

In the eastern part of the province, that is, in the Blue Ridge
area including Catoctin and South Mountains, Elk Ridge, and the
Middletown Valley, most water comes from springs and seeps and
there are few wells. In the western part springs are common and
shallow wells usually reach the water table, while deep wells reach
artesian conditions (Vokes and Edwards 1974).

The heavy underlying rocks of Catoctin and South Mountains and most
of the ridges west of Hagerstown valley are resistant to weathering
and tend to break into blocky fragments that mix with soil
materials to produce cobbly and channery soils on hill slopes and
valley margins (Vokes and Edwards 1974:149).

Blue Ridge lithic resources include guartz, quartzite,
metarhyolite, greenstone, and jasper (Stewart 1983).

Greater Appalachian Valley. This area is also called the "Valley
and Ridge" district. It is a lowland surmounted by long, narrow,
even-topped ridges with valley floors trenched by streams (Fennemen
1938:196). It consists of land west of the Blue Ridge to Dans
Mountain or the Allegheny front. There is a two-fold division into
the Great Valley in the east and the Allegheny ridge in the west.
The Great Valley is called the Cumberland Valley in Pennsylvania,
the Hagerstown Valley in Maryland, and the Shenandoah Valley in
Virginia. It consists of broad lowlands with a gently rolling
floor underlain by thick series of limestones and shales in the
more western part. The average elevation in Maryland of 500-600 ft
this increases from the Potomac to Pennsylvania. The Hagerstown
Valley extends from the western foot of South Mountain and Elk
Ridge highlands to Powell and Fairview Mountains on the west. It
is drained by Antietam creek in the east and Conococheague creek in
the west, both of which originate in Pennsylvania and flow towards
the Potomac. There is little relief in the valley.

The Allegheny Ridges lie between the Great Valley and Allegheny
front. These are a series of northeasterly trending ridges and
valleys eroded into weaker shale and limestone. They are
distinctive for the even level of ridges (Vokes and Edwards
1974:69).

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 38


=== Page 69 ===

The physical characteristics of the Valley and Ridge province are
connected with its drainages. Streams follow beds of soft rock and
cross hard rock through water gaps at right angles. Fennemen
(1938) notes that the features which characterize this district are
best displayed between the Susquehanna and the James Rivers where
the mountains are most nearly parallel, most even-crested, most
continuous, and with the most frequent alternation of ridges and
valleys.

Allegheny Plateau. The eastern margin of the Allegheny Plateau is
the Allegheny front. In Maryland this is Dans Mountain; in West
Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and northern Alabama it is
the Cumberland Plateau.

Streams flow south or east to the Potomac, although part of the
plateau is drained north through the Youghiogheny into the
Monongahela. Much of Garrett County, Maryland drains to the north
(Vokes and Edwards 1974:71). Many streams are swift-flowing and are
usually short, without floodplain development, There is
significant stream terrace development along the North Branch of
the Potomac and near the mouths of larger tributaries (Wall
1981:6). Glades are poorly drained upland meadows at the
headwaters of many creeks.

The Allegheny Plateau supports the most diversified fauna in the
state of Maryland. However, since 75% of the species and
subspecies are common between the Plateau and the Eastern Shore, it
is apparent that fauna are reasonably consistent from west to east
across the Potomac basin (Wesler et al. 1981:Vol.4).

In contrast to the abundant lithic resources of the adjacent Ridge
and Valley district, there are few good lithic resources for stone
tool use, although there are some outcrops of blue-grey chert.
There is also marble and limestone throughout the Appalachian as
well as the Piedmont (Vokes and Edwards 1974:119). Clays are also
available in the area. In the historic period flint clays have
been mined in Allegeny county since 1841, mainly from the Mount
Savage clay bed in the upper part of Georges Creek basin (Vokes and
Edwards 1974:127).

The most distinctive resource in the Allegheny Plateau is coal
deposits in western Allegeny and Garrett counties. These deposits
are part of the Appalachian coal region which stretches from
Pennsylvania to Alabama. In the western part the coal beds are
approximately horizontal while in the east they are folded.
Consequently, there is a grading from west to east in coal quality.
Soft bituminous coal is found in the west; semi-bituminous
"smokeless" coal is found in the central area; hard anthracite coal
fields are in the east. The coal basins in Maryland are in Georges
Creek, Upper Potomac, Castleman, Lower Youghiogheny, upper

I. PARK LANDS/PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 39

Youghiogheny. Natural gas fields are in the same general area as
coal (Vokes and Edwards 1974).

II. REGIONAL OVERVIEW
INTRODUCTION: WHAT ARCHEOLOGY IS

This introduction provides some comments on the discipline of
archeology to orient both archeologists and non-archeologists to
the concepts that underlie the overview in this plan. A glance at
the Table of Contents will reveal the structure of this overview.

While archaeology may in a sense be the past-
tense of anthropology, it is not the past-
tense of anthropology alone.

Renfrew 1982:4

In studying prehistoric societies, the
archaeologist dealing with goods is not
examining the ‘debris' or the ‘material
residue' of culture, but instead a very real
part of culture -- the visible part.

Wells 1992:176

On a map of the sciences, archaeology would be
a border state between the natural and social
sciences. It is like a social science in that
the objects of interest are people, human
culture and artifacts created under the
influence of ideas and social norms .. .
archaeology is also like a natural science in
that its focus in on the material remains of
people in the past and on their relation with
the natural environment.

Kosso 1991:621

In the United States archeology is considered part of the broader
discipline of anthropology, literally the study of humans. As
anthropology developed in this country in academic and museum
settings through the 19th and 20th centuries, all of its sub-
specialities were closely tied to the study of native American
peoples. Ethnography and ethnology were concerned with documenting
and comparing contemporary, living societies; anthropological
linguists recorded native languages; biological anthropologists
studied and compared physical characteristics of peoples;
archeologists investigated the tangible remains ~~ the artifacts
and architecture -- of past societies.

Anthropology as a profession has, of course, expanded to study far
more than native peoples and archeology is concerned with much more
than objects. What Lord Renfrew meant by the first remark quoted
above is that because archeology is concerned with the remains of
what has gone before, it is relevant to a whole range of fields,

II. OVERVIEW: INTRODUCTION 43


=== Page 74 ===

since many fields of study have tangible remains that may inform
about the past. Such fields include architectural history,
cultural landscape studies, and history. The link among all the
remains studied by archeologists is an interest in past human
activity.

Archeology as a study has the advantage of time depth and a breadth
of data for comparisons. The material remains which survive for
archeological study are varied, yet they obviously cannot represent
the whole of a living culture. Even though the material remains
are partial remains they are not inconsequential, but are the
remains of human action and intention. Archeology relies to a
great extent on insights and methods developed in the natural
sciences. The formation, preservation, and degradation of
archaeological sites and their contents are only understood by
applying geology, soil science, hydrology, chemistry, and the like.

It is commonly accepted that the three main goals of archeology are
1) the establishment of cultural chronological sequences; 2) the
elucidation of past lifeways; and 3) explanation of processes of
cultural change, such as the development of food producing
economies from hunting-gathering ones and the historical
development of industrialism. These goals are pursued within the
basic frameworks of space, time, and the formal attributes of
artifacts and the built environment.

Archeological reconstructions are always to be augmented,
challenged, and refined as new data and new theoretical concepts
become available. This overview is designed to provide a context
for defining issues in prehistory and historical archeology in the
Potomac Basin and, more broadly, in the Chesapeake region and the
mid-Atlantic.

There are many studies about the history of archeological theory
and practice in the United States and in the world (e.g., Willey
and Sabloff 1980; Trigger 1989; Malina and Vasicek 1990). There
are also numerous explanations and critiques about the way that
archeologists make sense of their data (e.g., Trigger 1978; Gibbon
1984; Shanks and Tilley 1987; Gardin and Peebles 1992). This plan
is not the place to summarize debates within archeology, but it is
necessary to acknowledge that there are important debates and that
an overview and discussion of archeological issues could take very
different forms than the one presented here.

Many standard summaries of prehistory and history take the form of
rote background sections for Cultural Resource Management reports.
These outlines, which have the advantage of being short, general,
and non-controversial, offer the broadest possible backdrop for
whatever study is being written and featured. Only rarely do these
grand overviews change as the result of any single study. Like the
millennia they represent, prehistoric overviews are slow to change

II. OVERVIEW: INTRODUCTION 44


=== Page 75 ===

in any substantial way. There are some exceptions to this pattern,
exceptions that point up the problems with rote, perhaps
ritualized, descriptions of time periods gone by. Disadvantages
lie in the general, non-controversial, often simplistic view of the
past that is tendered: people came; they hunted; they learned how
to plant; they buried their dead. It is no wonder, given such
trivial generality, that archeology is often reduced to a hunt for
artifacts. Objects seem so much more immediately interesting than
the irrelevant commonplaces of human history.

What I have attempted to do here is to present a productive and
interesting structure for an archeological plan that may serve for
the next few decades. I have assessed the trends in the discipline
and have organized this discussion for general usefulness. In
addressing each topic I often describe the approach of some major
work(s) not necessarily confined to regional concerns in order to
provide a context for thinking about archeological data in the
Potomac Basin. Not all of the theoretical positions or approaches
I mention have been used in the mid-Atlantic and I wish to suggest
that they may be applied. I do not, however, seek to develop a
critique of mid-Atlantic archeology, as that would be an effort far
outside of the scope of this plan.

A Note on Time Notation

Conventional time notation of years as B.C. or A.D. is abandoned
here in favor of the theologically neutral BCE (Before Current
Era), which is equivalent to B.C., and CE (Current Era), which is
equivalent to A.D. Dates are often given as BP (Before Present).
For archeologists, "present" is defined as 1950 CE. Usually I have
simply added 2000 years to a BCE designation for an approximate
date BP.

AN INTRODUCTION TO ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC:
ANALOGY AND CAUTIONARY TALES

Analogy: A means of reasoning based on the
assumption that if two things are similar in some
respects, then they must be similar in other
respects

Thomas 1989:648

Archeologists rely quite heavily upon the use of analogy in many
ways. Analogies may be made between the past and ethnographic,
historical, and current descriptions or models. They may be quite
specific, focusing on the function of a particular artifact, or
more general, concerning social strategies for dealing with scarce
resources.

Analogies between known and unknown cultures have been used from
the beginning of archeology with varying degrees of precision and
consciousness, but one of the first and most influential attempts
to make this logic explicit was by Lewis Binford. In an
influential article entitled, "Smudge pits and hide smoking: the
use of analogy in archaeological reasoning" Binford (1967)
attempted to clarify the structure of analogical thinking and its
application to archeological logic. In keeping with the tenets of
the new archeology which focused on ecological causes and
positivist methodology, the two most important points made in
Binford's discussion were 1) the most appropriate analogies were
those made between the most similar ecological settings; and 2)
analogies in themselves were not answers or explanations, but
simply presented hypothetical proposals to be tested with
independent archeological data.

Both points are quite important. The first has been modified by a
more sophisticated understanding of ecology and environment. For
example, Binford's (1980) description of hunter-gatherer
adaptations as falling along a continuum of strategies relies on
analogy with the structure of resources in the physical
environment. His model is explained in the section on landscape,
but briefly is this: human strategy for gathering resources
(without agriculture) will depend upon the degree of spatial and
temporal continuity or patchiness of resources. Of course, most
environments in which humans live are quite variable and the
continuity of resources changes seasonally. In the eastern
woodlands, for example, timber is a continuous resource in both
time and space but acceptable lithic sources may be quite
discontinuous. Anadromous fish runs are temporally patchy, but
such a seasonal windfall can be somewhat evened out by storage
technology.

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 46


=== Page 77 ===

The insight that environmental structure in the broadest sense is
more important than factors such as climate or amount or
precipitation allows a far greater range of analogies and,
therefore, sources of questions and insight. When considered in
conjunction with the second point, this insight allows us to see
that it may be useful to draw hypotheses from seemingly far-flung
sources as Scott Parker (1990) does in using ethnographic data on
the !Kung San of southern Africa to model some practices in the
Paleoindian boreal forest environment of the eastern United States.
The potential comparative value comes from hunting-gathering
groups' similar needs to confront periodic shortages, even though
the shortages are of vastly different resources.

Binford's second point, that analogies are sources of hypotheses
rather than explanations, is crucial for avoiding one of the major
potential drawbacks of analogical thinking. The objection that has
been voiced about analogy is that we can never understand anything
new about the past if we only seek to apply what is known
ethnographically or historically. This concern has led to an
extension of analogy which may be referred to as argument by
anomaly. That is, one finds an analogy appropriate to the
archeological problem, identifies and seeks archeological
correlates, and looks for the lack of fit or anomalies which should
signal at least some of the differences between past and present
adaptations. It is this logic which Binford (1977, 1981, 1987) has
formalized in his discussion of "middle range theory" and that Mark
Leone and others (e.g., Leone 1988; Leone and Crosby 1987; Potter
1992) have adapted for middle range theory in historical
archaeology.

To many minds, one of the most desirable use of analogies is the

"direct historical approach," wherein ethnographically or
historically known practices are traced back into the past to
explain archeological phenomena. Pueblo cultures in the

southwestern United States provide some of the most well-studied
direct connections between archeological and living cultures.
There is a potentially false sense of stasis implied by such
analogies, as they tend to emphasize what seems to have remained
continuous. One important advantage to such situations is that the
whole range of culture is considered, whether implicitly or
explicitly. That is, religion, social mores, and the like are
automatically part of the archeologically known culture, in
contrast to purely environmentally focused analogies which tend to
leave out "ethnographic" factors.

The Band-Tribe-Chief-State Typology
The most pervasive analogy in American archeology is probably

Service's (1962, 1975) model of sociopolitical types: the band-
tribe-chiefdom-state evolutionary typology. Such a classificatory

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 47


=== Page 78 ===

system has the advantage of imposing “order onto chaos" and thereby
providing some categories and language with which to begin to make
sense of a very complex world. However, there are serious
criticisms of this model and such models in general. Such
typologies tend to artificially reduce the variation of human
adaptation as all societies are placed into one of a very few
typological boxes.

The band-tribe-chiefdom-state typology is based on ethnographic
models of political organization. In general, the types may be
thought of as being along a continuum with bands being the most
egalitarian and having the least social differentiation and states
being the least egalitarian with the most social differentiation.
These types generally correspond to an economic classification as
well, although there are important exceptions. Bands often
characterize hunter-gatherers although, in rich environments such
as the ethnographically documented Northwest coast, non-food-
producers may be organized as chiefdoms. Tribes are said to
characterize horticulturalists and pastoralists while intensive
agriculturalists are organized into chiefdoms or states.
Industrialists are organized as states.

Many archeologists are rightly critical of the typological approach
which uses single attributes to represent whole sets of

characteristics. Gary Feinman and Jill Neitzel (1984), for
example, argue that such an approach precludes the possibility of
recognizing prehistoric variability. Instead they argue that

archeology needs to study social differences along a broad range of
analytic attributes.

Analogies, Archeological Logic, and Addressing Bias

Analogies provide us with expectations about what we ought to find
and how we will label it and therefore they affect the observations
we make. The analogies we choose are greatly affected by current
understandings as well as current prejudices. While analogies are
often called upon for seemingly simple identifications of function,
as for identifying the use of artifact types, they are deeply
embedded in more encompassing categories and models. Models of
evolutionary development of social system and _ political
organization particularly color our expectations. They also affect
and sometimes limit the questions we ask because it may seem that
we already "know" what people did at particular "levels" of
development. In that case it is unlikely that we will ask
questions which challenge these assumptions.

Addressing the problem of such archeological bias at the artifact
level, Alice Kehoe (1990) points out that conventional terminology
in archeology has "hidden" certain artifact classes. She argues
that more and better use of ethnographic analogy would help to

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 48


=== Page 79 ===

correct the problem. She uses the northern Athapaskans of the
Canadian boreal forest as analogies to upper Paleolithic people in
Europe to point out the importance of traps, snares, and nets for
hunting.

Ethnographers of the Montagnais-Naskapi, emphasize the necessity
and universality of hunting traps, snares, and nets in the survival
of human hunting groups (Kehoe 1990:27). Projectiles are the final
and sometimes unnecessary step in hunting; traps are the primary
means by which hunters get close to their prey (Kehoe 1990:27).

One ethnographer, for example, writes:
Something has been said already of lines in Ingalik culture
but the longer one works on Northern Athapaskan materials, the
more intense is one's feeling for their significance...[O]ver
two hundred or almost two-thirds of the items of the Ingalik
culture include lines in their manufacture [Osgood 1940:435}.

According to ethnographically observed division of labor, women
work in pliable materials that tend to be perishable, while men
work in "wood, stone and bone" (Kehoe 1990:;30). "Tools for
manufacturing lines and products constructed with lines, e.g.,
traps, nets, textiles, mats are as a rule deceptively simple awls,
both flattened and pointed, flat rods and elongated flat ovals, and
multipurpose knives" (Kehoe 1990:30).

Kehoe (1990:31) writes that:
Archeologists' failure to note evidence for the manufacture
and use of lines...is not simply a matter of the perishability
of ropes, strings and thongs. It is a problem of working
through the dominant paradigm.

Part of Kehoe's point about the dominant paradigm is the difficulty
of asking non-traditional questions, learning what kinds of data
address those questions, and learning to observe new kinds of
evidence. Related to this point is Kehoe's conviction that a
failure to consider the material culture of lines is related to a
general failure to consider women's work in the past. Therefore,
women's artifact classes become invisible. However, such failure
to consider both women's and men's work skews our understanding of
human life.

Kehoe's observations are important for interpreting life in the
boreal forest of the mid-Atlantic states prior to the Late Archaic
period. Although there may be little physical evidence recovered
of lines and, analogously as well, women's hand in hunting and
trapping, there is every reason to incorporate ethnographic
observations into models of past technological, social, and labor
organization.

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 49


=== Page 80 ===

Commenting on this problem of limited observation, Joan Gero
(1990:113) writes, "Observation in archaeology emerges out of an
active interplay of tacit beliefs and formal conventions." She
emphasizes the need to restructure observational categories that
would provoke new questions,

In the same spirit as Gero's and Kehoe's critique, James
Schoenwetter (1990:110) writes that “archeological work is often
informed by ideas that rarely come under the systematic scrutiny
they deserve." He continues,
even those powers of observation that allow identification of
archeological data are generated and constrained by the
character of the theory we are prepared to accept, and that
theory may be derived from the research practices and
experiences with which we are most familiar [Schoenwetter
1990:110].

Similarly, Bruce Trigger (1985:231) writes,
increasing familiarity with the development of archaeology in
different parts of the world indicates that social, political,
and cultural differences influence not only the questions
archaeologists ask but also the answers that they are prepared
to accept as credible.

The key to addressing these critiques is to maintain flexibility
and a healthy scientific skepticism. Many archeologists are
attempting to reconstruct both acceptable questions and answers in
archeology (e.g., Spector 1993; Hodder 1986). For example, the
gist of adding the issue of gender to archeology involves
rethinking and looking anew at what archeological interpretation
has taken for granted for a long time.

There is relatively little information about prehistory and
therefore, it seems as if we are satisfied to "discover" and to
"know" something about what happened in the past, even if that
something is a biased, 19th-century ethnographic stereotype.
Gender, as a social factor, is a valuable avenue to prompt the
critical thinking and questioning process (e.g., Gero and Conkey
1991).

The critique raised by these authors is not confined to
archeological investigation of "social" issues. It applies as well
to issues of tool types and the analysis of tool function.
Consider some ongoing analysis of stone tools. For many years it
was unquestioned that formal "projectile points" were the primary
tool of hunting and were used as spear or arrow points. However,
the ubiquitous projectile point needs to be reexamined and
interpreted in a broader cultural context. Richard J. Dent (1991a)
and Jay Custer (1990) both argue that many of these points were
used as knives or generalized bifaces. Douglas McLearen (1991:93)

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 50


=== Page 81 ===

confirms that most archeologists now recognize that many objects
formerly identified as projectile points had multiple purposes.

Because in most archeological contexts organic remains are not
preserved there is little survival of traps, snares, lines, hafts,
and the like. Lithics are often the only available source of data
on hunting but interpretations of hunting based on lithics alone
have been misleading. George Odell (1988) effectively challenges
two long-standing assumptions: 1) items we recognize as diagnostic
"points" were the predominant kind of projectile heads; 2) the bow
and arrow were adopted no earlier than 500 CE. Use wear analysis
reveals that apparent points were used for cutting, slicing,
graving, and drilling and that other tips such as unifacial points
and unretouched flakes were often used for projectiles.

While it is generally accepted that large points were used as
spears and small points tipped arrow shafts, there are some
ethnographic indications that this is too simplistic a view and
that a trend toward smaller points may indicate developments in
arrow fletching (Odell 1988).

In examining lithic material from the Illinois Valley, Odell
discovered that only 12.5% of those artifacts identified as
morphological projectile points actually functioned as projectiles.
In arguing that morphological projectile points were not
necessarily used for hunting or as weaponry Odell (1988:345)
writes,
"Point/knives" were used for cutting, shaving, graving,
scraping, adze/chop/dig, awl/drill and other identified
activities. Retouched flakes were the largest single group of
artifact types with projectile use damage: "Debris"
manifesting projectile wear is plentiful, a situation that
helps to explain the nature of the ‘'missing' projectile
points.

Temporal trends in projectile damage lead Odell (1988) to interpret
an earlier use of the bow and arrow than commonly assumed. At least
in the Illinois valley, a change in hunting strategy such as the
use of the bow and arrow seems to have occurred during the Middle
Woodland rather than during the Late Woodland.

The observation that pieces of stone manufacturing "debris" were
used to tip projectiles brings forth the larger issue of analyzing
all such debris. Because lithic studies are usually done for
classification of finds into time periods they may ignore
expediently produced tools. Those tools that are not formally
identifiable as conforming to a particular style often are
classified as debitage or byproducts (Gero 1991la). Of particular
interest to understanding stone technology is the functional
investigation of expedient, non-standardized tools. For example,
Carol Spears (1975) focuses on nutting, Jenny Adams(1988) on

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 51


=== Page 82 ===

leather-working, and Patricia Price-Beggerly (1976) on wood-
working. Such studies force us to reexamine what is meant by the
category of tools and provide access to past division of labor not
possible by focusing on formally and traditionally recognized tool
types (Gero 1991la,b).

Critiques of archeological logic and of standard archeological
interpretation raise important questions. Where do our categories
come from? How does conventional archeological logic compress the
complexity of the past into symbolic lessons about the present?
There are a variety of avenues to really increase the power of
observation in archeology, including refocusing ethnoarcheology
toward user meaning, directing attention to gender, and
concentrating on intergroup interaction (Nelson and Kehoe 1990;
Gero and Conkey 1991).

All of these issues and critiques are, of course, applicable to
archeology in the mid-Atlantic. Challenging and refining
archeological concepts and methods are ongoing and necessary tasks
for archeology to remain a vibrant discipline.

This need is equally compelling for both prehistory and historical
archeology even though some of the conceptual tools are quite
different. If prehistorians may be lulled into complacency using
time-honored typologies to structure their reconstructions of past
lifeways, historical archeologists may also be overwhelmed by the
seeming authority of documentary evidence and the weight of
standing interpretations of the past. In lieu of ethnographers'
descriptions of contemporary cultures, historical archeologists
often use ethnohistorical accounts, which contain different sorts
of biases. Instead of a band-tribe-chiefdom-state typology,
historical archeology may adopt historians' and anthropologists’
models such as the rural and urban dichotomy, mercantile and
industrial capitalism, and colonialism and frontier development.

Prehistoric Analogies and Kunting-Gathering Societies

The ethnohistoric record is useful, but is limited in both time and
space. One of the limitations of ethnographic analogy is the small
number of ethnographically described cultures, particularly non-
food producers. Hunter-Gatherers who survived into the modern era
survived only in marginal environments and certainly do not
represent the pockets of primitive survivals of earlier human
lifeways that they were assumed to during the 19th century.
Instead hunter-gatherers were squeezed out of productive
environments by agriculturalists, either neighbors or foreign
invaders. By necessity, analogies are gathered more broadly and
often are considered more appropriate and more informative if they
are taken from societies of similar sociopolitical "level," that

Ii. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 52


=== Page 83 ===

is, complexity along the continuum of the band-tribe-chiefdom-state
typology.

Ethnographic analogy must be used with extreme caution, especially
since there are no ethnographically known societies for the vast
majority of human history. However, there is little else with
which one may begin to ask questions of the prehistoric past. The
following discussion provides a general overview of the kinds of
ideas drawn from ethnographic knowledge and applied in
archeological reconstruction. I also include a caution about
making simplistic assumptions about "simple" hunter-gatherers and
"complex" food producers.

The social organization of hunter-gatherers is postulated through
analogies of settlement size and distribution with ethnographically
Known groups. Kin-based bands are almost certain. Whether the
associated units are based on "nuclear" families made up of a man
and woman and their children, extended families of any composition,
sisters and their children, or other family forms is unknown.

It is usually taken as a universal that age and sex are organizing
principles in human societies. We expect that elderly men and
women have different tasks than other adults and that children have
roles different from those of adults. But the number of age-grades
and gender roles may vary greatly.

Although not universal, it is most common for adult men to be
responsible for the tracking and hunting of larger animals.
Similarly, adult women do most of the searching and gathering of
plant foods. Both sexes often hunt and trap (collect) small
animals. Women tend to be responsible for the preparation and
distribution of food. Both or either men and women fish. Elderly
men and women are often responsible for healing and for spiritual
celebration and ritual. Both men and women have (often separate)
roles that are spiritual, medicinal, and socially integrative.

It is likely that men and women made and repaired the tools that
they used for their respective tasks. Stone tools have long been
assumed to have been the special province of men, and since stone
is a most enduring and obvious material, the focus on stone tools
as virtually the only clues to much of our past has served to
render women's activities among mobile hunter-gatherers
"invisible." Division of labor probably varied considerably. Most
adults probably made and used tools and equipment, working stone,
wood, bone, hide, sinew, plant fibers, and other available
materials for their shelter, their subsistence, and their
amusement. The lines and cords that are essential to survival in
a northern habitat are illustrated in the case of the northern
Athapaskan, referred to above (Kehoe 1990). As Kehoe and others
(e.g., Gero and Conkey 1991) have suggested, the "invisibility" of
one gender's work is largely a result of the questions

II. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 53


=== Page 84 ===

archeologists have asked and the conceptual tools used to address
these questions in the archeological record.

Thomas Cook (1976) offers a detailed model of tools and debris for
extractive, maintenance, and social tasks. He (1976:13) describes
his model as "a melange of various ethnohistoric sources concerning
the manufacture of tools and processing of environmental materials
for food and items of material culture." This model, which is
testable for the mid-Atlantic as well as other regions, is
summarized in Table II.1.

The fission-fusion model of settlement and social dispersal and
aggregation is widely used. In this model small groups fuse
together at certain times of year to use seasonally abundant
resources and to socialize and find marriage partners. Large
groups split, or fission, to spread across the landscape to use
more limited resources. Many ethnographically-known mobile hunter-
gatherers split and join together in their movement to exploit
seasonal resources. As environmental resources change, the
requirements of labor within a social group also change. The
division of labor between men and women changes in some ways as
seasonality makes an impact on movement. There are variable
opportunities to meet with other groups, as the demands of seasonal
scheduling require certain movement. There are traveling parties
and exchange of information, goods, and marriage partners.

There is a long-standing bias in anthropology which associates a
society's means of subsistence with its cultural complexity,
assuming that complexity arrives with food production. There are at
least two sources of the bias. One is an over-reliance for
analogies on ethnographically-known hunter-gatherers, who have
survived in marginal environments and therefore may offer
misleading analogies for abundant environments. The other is the
stage concept in human evolution, which unrealistically downplays
the diversity of human adaptation and predicts wholesale changes
between stages (Price and Brown 1985:3-20). The familiar band-
tribe-chiefdom-state model assumes a regular progression from
simple to complex.

However, an increasingly sophisticated understanding of human
cultures leads to a rejection of an uncomplicated dichotomy between
simple foragers and complex farmers, It is apparent
that many characteristics previously associated solely with
farmers -- sedentism, elaborate burial and substantial tombs,
social inequality, occupational specialization, long-distance
exchange, technological innovation, warfare -- are also to be
found among many foraging societies [Price and Brown 1985:16].

Douglas Price and James Brown (1985:xiii-xv) advocate the

exploration of cultural complexity of hunter-gatherers through
themes such as the intensification of food production, the origins

Il. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 54


=== Page 85 ===

of sedentary communities, and the emergence of social inequality
and hierarchy (Price and Brown 1985:xiii-xv).

Intensification of food production has most often been addressed in
the context of the development of agriculture. Abundant resources,
however, may instigate complexity. In a characterization that is
relevant to Chesapeake societies, although it was not developed for
them, maritime-oriented hunter-gatherer groups may be described as
possessing: 1) high resource biomass; 2) high resource diversity;
3) low resource seasonality; 4) "unearned" (migratory) resources;
5) linear settlement pattern; 6) sedentism; 7) technological
complexity and cooperative socioeconomic focus on resource
exploitation; 8) high per capita productivity; 9) high population
density; and 10) territoriality, resource competition and warfare
(Yesner 1980 in Price and Brown 1985:6). Although Chesapeake
societies were not maritime-oriented, there are times and places
for which the abundance of estuarine resources make it worth
considering carefully the relationship between complexity and both
the environment and procurement techniques.

Also writing of the manipulation of resources, Brian Hayden sees
two major trends, also relevant to the mid-Atlantic during various
time periods: 1) general diversification of resources exploited in
areas of poor to moderate resource richness; and 2) a tendency
toward specialization in habitually exploited resources in

resource-rich areas. This observation may be applicable in
understanding the ebb and flow of trading networks in relation to
the predictability of food resources. Hayden reverses a

traditional expectation about the development of societies by tying
the disappearance of extensive trade and interaction networks to
emerging complexity. In his view, diversification of the resource
base is an expected human response to the need for resource
reliability (Price and Brown 1985:6).

Price and Brown (1985) indicate that the conditions of complexity
include societal circumscription, abundant resources, and higher
population. They suggest that the consequences of complexity
include effects upon 1) productivity, with regard to technology,
procurement activities and occupational specialization; 2)
settlement, particularly increasing sedentism; and 3) decision-
making, particularly regarding inequality and status
differentiation. They emphasize that the causes of complexity,
whatever they may be, are dependent on social relations, especially
the relations of production.

Similarly, William Marquardt (1985:67) attributes culture change
not only to adaptation to changes in the physical environment but
also to "“sociohistorical structures" such as values, myths, class
relations,and the like.

Ii. OVERVIEW: ARCHEOLOGICAL LOGIC 55


=== Page 86 ===

Successful approaches to complexity "will involve the examination
of change in specific variables and institutions of society rather
than the attempt to document leaps from bands to tribes or from
simple to complex" (Price and Brown 1985:16),

In the mid-Atlantic region, the variability of hunter-gatherer
societies is an issue central to most of prehistory since hunting-
gathering remained the principle subsistence strategy until the
Late Woodland period. This variability and complexity of groups
prior to the full-scale adoption of agriculture has yet to he
adequately researched.

CHRONOLOGICAL OVERVIEW
Introduction to Dates and Time Periods

Table II.2 summarizes a few of the dates and time periods used by
archeologists in the mid-Atlantic region for pre- and protohistoric
periods. As is apparent, there is some disagreement over the
definitions of time periods. This plan uses time periods which
agree with as many others in current use as possible and practical.
There is also some disagreement over the diagnostic artifacts which
belong to each time period. However, all researchers are limited
by the same basic data in assigning actual dates. Assigning
specific dates to periods and developments relies on a combination
of techniques.

Chronological control is established through direct or indirect
methods to yield chronometric (measured in years) or relative
dates. The method(s) of dating obviously affect the confidence we
have in our histories and cultural interpretations. Relative
dating, which identifies an earlier/later relationship, is
important for refining relationships and development of artifact
styles within stratified sites. The principle of stratigraphy,
borrowed from geology, is at the heart of archeological temporal
analysis. The careful combination and comparison of stratified
layers, the formally distinctive artifacts found in them, and
independently assigned dates form the basis for any region's
prehistoric sequence.

The most common and reliable method of chronometrically dating
prehistoric contexts in the mid-Atlantic is radiocarbon dating but
it must be interpreted correctly. Dates should be cited with the
understanding that a radiocarbon date is a probability statement
(Levine 1990). Radiocarbon age estimates are best understood as a
range rather than as a definitive year. For example, a date of 100
+ 50 CE means that there is a 67% chance that the actual date falls
between 50 and 150 CE. There is the added complication that
organic remains could be contaminated by regional forest fires
(Patterson and Sassaman 1988), which would call some radiocarbon
dates into question due to implied contamination.

Because suitable samples for radiocarbon dating are infrequently
available and because analyzing samples is fairly expensive,
archaeologists often rely on dates from sometimes distant sites
associated with similar diagnostic styles. That is, the
radiocarbon date for an xyz point at site A is used to date all xyz
points in a broad region. There are few alternatives. However,
one of the problems with this reliance on a few dates is obvious:
one can never trace temporal relationships among the occurrence of
point styles if they have, by definition, the same date.

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /DATES 61


=== Page 92 ===



=== Page 93 ===

Temporally diagnostic artifacts, specifically point styles, are
used most consistently to date prehistoric contexts. Temporally
diagnostic tools are useful but there continually lurks the danger
that contemporaneous material which is not temporally diagnostic,
but is essential for understanding the range of material culture
and the economy, is ignored in the quest for temporal context.

For historical contexts, the most common dating methods beyond
direct historical documentation are to use pipestem dating for
17th-century sites (if there is a sufficient sample of pipestems)
or the known manufacturing dates for ceramics calculating a
terminus post quem or TPQ (the date after which something must have
been deposited), a mean ceramic date, and/or a histogram of ceramic
date ranges. Some other artifact categories may be dated according
to known manufacturing characteristics, as with glass, or to known
dates, such as the date on a coin. In some cases dendrochronology
can be used at historic sites in the eastern United States if there
is good preservation of wood in a wet context, or if there is a
standing structure with original wooden timbers.

Defining time periods brings up an important issue of legitimacy.
Various researchers have raised this issue for the Middle Archaic
in the mid-Atlantic. Michael Stewart (1991b), for example, wonders
if there really are shared adaptations or if the time period is
simply a device for organizing disparate data. He asks if it would
be better to abandon the attempt at synthesis, since the
variability during the period is then obscured. George Nicholas
(1987) asks of the Early Archaic:
Is there, in fact, a discernible character to {the early
Archaic]...that is qualitatively different from those of
earlier or later periods in terms of social organization,
economy, and ethnicity, for example, and not simply because of
artifact styles?

Such questions are indeed important to address for all of the time
periods archeologists create.

Any period scheme colors the way we think about people in the past
and the stability, change and variability in their societies. The
scheme used in this overview is traditional but is not meant to
impose an inflexible understanding of past developments.

Tables I1.3, I1I.4, I1.5, II.6 and I1.7 provide some of the
temporally diagnostic material culture styles recognized in the
mid-Atlantic. Table [1.3 lists formal styles of stone points.
Table II.4 provides selected radiocarbon dates for those point
types. Table II.5 lists pre- and protohistoric pottery types. Once
pottery is developed and used, it varies morphologically more than
identified point styles and therefore provides more sensitive
temporal markers. Pottery is described by tempering material, form
and manufacturing technique, and decorative technique.

most frequently cited ceramic time markers.

Analogies in Mid-Atlantic Archeology

Archeologists have used various analogies to help explain
adaptations in the mid-Atlantic region before European contact and
settlement. Interpretation of Potomac Basin Paleoindian finds
relies on analogies of several sorts. Although the pan-American
interpretation of Clovis lifeways based on western sites has been
rejected and refined, there continues to be reliance on far-flung
sites in the east for interpreting local finds. This dependence is
not inappropriate, but needs to be recognized and continually
refined as Paleoindian movements and regional variations are
recognized.

Jay Custer and Michael Stewart (1990) propose that the best modern
environmental analogies for the Paleoindian period are the forests
of southern Quebec and Labrador and the scrub forests of coastal
Maine. The ethnographically known inhabitants of the Eastern
subarctic include the Naskapi, Montagnais, Eastern Cree, and
Attikamek (Custer and Stewart 1990).

These groups also may provide the best analogy for the Early and
Middle Archaic (Custer 1990; LeeDecker et al. 1991). They practice
generalized foraging using a broad range of resources and their
social organization is characterized by flexibility, as is that of
most hunter-gatherers. Their broad-based hunting is supplemented
by fishing and gathering, although the use of fish may he
underestimated ethnographically. High residential mobility covers
annually a mean area of approximately 48,000 square kilometers.
Such far-ranging mobility into several physiographic zones provides
access to a great range of resources.

The summary of ethnographic observation on the seasonal
characteristics of subsistence and settlement for the Montagnais-
Naskapi is provided in Table I1I.8.

The particular seasonally available resources would be different in
the mid-Atlantic but the ethnographically documented correlation
between settlement type, social group size, and food resources
provide a framework with which to pose questions. But the questions
are not limited to the kinds of data which ethnographers saw fit to
describe. For example, as is discussed further in the section on
the use of the landscape, the effect of lithic resources on early
prehistoric settlement has been extensively discussed within the
mid-Atlantic. Raw materials, however, are not noted in the seasonal
chart of Table II.8.

It.

During the Late Archaic, Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland time
periods the environment was largely modern, although there was some
variability.

Several different groups from all over the world have been
suggested as appropriate analogies for mid-Atlantic societies
during these periods. George Nicholas (1987:103) suggests that the
Ainu of northern Japan would be an appropriate analogical
ethnographic group for Holocene groups in the northern temperate
zone. He is critical of using groups such as the desert-dwelling
'Kung, and the northern Netsilik, Nunamiut, and Barren Ground
Eskimo, Cree, or Montagnais-Naskapi as many archeologists have
done. Daniel Mouer (1991a:265) suggests that, due to the richness
of the mid-Atlantic environment, appropriate analogies should be
made with the Tlingit and Kwakiutl of the Northwest Coast during
the 19th century.

An analogy often used for groups displaying some status
differentiation but not enough to be considered chiefdoms is that
ef the ethnographically documented "Big Man" system in New Guinea
(Sahlins 1970), "Big Men" are influential individuals who enhance
their prestige by displaying and manipulating objects they acquire
through trade with other "big men." They also gain and obligate
supporters by providing feasts and giving away prestige objects.
Because "Big Man" positions relied on individual achievement and
persuasion rather than on inherited power or the direct control of
resources, they are part of egalitarian systems without
institutionalized leadership.

Leadership and social organization analogous to "Big Man" systems
has been proposed for some mid-Atlantic groups prior to the
adoption of maize agriculture (e.g., Stewart 1992; Blanton 1992).
Custer (1988), for example, writes of the Late Archaic to Middle
Woodland periods that,
the combination of circumscribed environments and intensive
coastal resource utilization focusing on a variety of
resources created biosocial environments where more complex
big-man organizations had an adaptive advantage.

For the latter part of the Late Woodland and the protohistoric
periods, ethnohistorical data provide the most direct analogies.
However, groups west of the Coastal Plain are not well described.
Table II.9 summarizes the seasonal characteristics of subsistence
for the Virginia Algonquians. Except for those produced by
agriculture, food resources may be assumed to have been available
since the stabilization of the Chesapeake Bay by the Late Archaic.

A thorough description of the socio-political organization of the
Chesapeake Algonquians at the time of contact through the end of
the 17th century is provided by Potter (1993; and see Table II.9
below), Turner (1976, 1985), and Rountree (1989).

Il.

Archeologists have drawn upon a variety of models to provide a
context for analysis of historic period resources. Consumer
theory, ethnic boundary maintenance, socioeconomic class
relationships, and the world economic system are some of the
frameworks used. The latter, adapted from scholars such as Fernand
Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Eric Wolf, provides an
overarching framework for the historical period. More
specifically, a focus on mercantile and industrial capitalism has
been suggested as a way to keep the myriad issues of historical
archeology connected: "In the United States ... historical
archeology is nearly always centered on time periods and people
embedded in or buffeted by the complex context of capitalism"
(Little 1994:16). Within this overarching framework fit many
different research topics which address questions on the global,
regional, local, and household levels.

An influential model of archeologically observed change has been
offered by James Deetz (e.g., 1977). He describes a general
cultural change in the world view of New England colonists, but the
change he describes is far more widespread throughout the English
colonies. The cultural shift from a medieval mindset, emphasizing
values of communality, to a Renaissance and Enlightenment-inspired
individuality, is represented in various categories of material
culture. Artifacts and other remains relating to food preparation
and presentation have been the most archeologically visible of
these. For example, in the mainstream Anglo-American culture of
the 18th century, bowls for serving shared stews give way to a
predominance of platters for serving cuts of meat. Large shared
trenchers are replaced by matched sets of individual plates.

Deetz's model of cultural change has been and continues to be
tested, applied, and refined. One of the most influential
modifications came about the placing the observed changes within
the context of mercantile and then industrial capitalism developing
as a world economic system (Leone 1988; Shackel 1993a). Several
archeologists have suggested that capitalism be considered the
proper primary focus of the discipline (e.g., Leone 1977; Leone and
Potter 1988; Orser 1988; Paynter 1988). Barbara Little (1994:17)
writes:
Within the world system of capitalism there are certainly
different spatial and temporal scales of analysis and
different foci for research. Within the United States the
phenomenon of capitalism is not necessarily specific to region
or time period; it is not unique to East Coast industrialism.
Although capitalism supports and is supported by a dominant
cultural ideology, neither it nor the ideology is transcendent
or all-encompassing; they are challenged, changed, and
embraced.
The recognition of capitalism as a complex and multi-dimensional
umbrella under which to construct interpretations is leading to the
continual refinement of historical archeological frameworks.

General Environmental Parameters During the Paleoindian Period

Within Paleoindian studies, a model has emerged to differentiate
early Paleoindian period (c. 11,500-10,500 BP) adaptations in
glaciated and unglaciated portions of eastern North America
(Meltzer and Smith 1986; Tankersley and Isaac 1990a). This model
emphasizes caribou hunting in the former and mixed foraging in that
latter. Although there is disagreement, most recent investigations
of Paleoindians in North American use this dichotomy of landscape.
Custer and Stewart (1990) reject the distinction because the
paleoenvironment is unique and has no modern analogues. However,
the differentiation is useful because, although unique, human
adaptations within glaciated and unglaciated environments certainly
may be contrasted against each other.

Edward Smith (1990) agrees that one of most significant conceptual
shifts in Quaternary studies is the relatively recent realization
that Pleistocene biomes were not at all like those of the present.
He summarizes reconstructions of the paleoenvironment and
emphasizes the dynamic nature of climatic and biotic change at the
late Pleistocene/Holocene interface between 12,000-10,000 BP. The
late glacial environment was a complex, highly transitory mix of
boreal-deciduous-herbaceous vegetation distinct from closed
deciduous forest of Holocene. There was a very rapid reordering of
vegetation across eastern North America about 10,000 years ago. By
then, an essentially modern Holocene vegetation association had
replaced the late glacial mosaic forests.

Charles LeeDecker et al. (1991:27) note the general characteristics

of the Late Glacial paleoclimatic episode from 10,000-8,000 BCE:
Climatic conditions were cooler and moister than at present,
but the gradual warming led to the retreat of the Laurentide
ice sheet; regional environment characterized by a boreal
forest, dominated by spruce, deer, elk, and moose were the
largest game animals, but other cold-adapted species were also
present.

Pollen cores taken at the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line in

Prince Georges County, Maryland indicate the following for the

period 12,000-10,800 BP:
Pine-Alder-Composite assemblage; cold climate; floodplain
environment dominated by conifers (pine and spruce) and alder,
with some herbaceous plants, primarily composites; hazelnut,
ash and walnut present in moderate numbers; dominant
nonarboreal taxa include madder and milkwort; blueberry,
buckwheat, ragweed, arrowwood, wood-fern, cinnamon fern, and
club moss also present [LeeDecker et al. 1991:32].

There are important implications for human adaptation that have
come out of the refinement of environmental reconstruction. Many
text-books and traditional archeology describe Paleoindians as
"big-game hunters," assuming that mastodon and ancient bison
remains which are associated with Paleoindian artifacts in the
western United States must have been the preferred game in the east

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY/PALEOINDIAN 82

as well. Careful paleoenvironmental reconstruction at the Shawnee-
Minisink site in the Delaware Valley indicates that by the time
people occupied the area, the megafauna were already gone. Plant
and fish remains at the site suggest that Paleoindians were
generalized hunter~-gatherers rather than big-game specialists (Dent
1991b). By Paleoindian times, c. 11,200 BP, there were spruce-
dominated boreal forests with hardwoods and therefore, the main
environment to which people had to adapt was the boreal forest, not
tundra, mosaic, or spruce parkland. Therefore the available fauna
consisted of modern deer, elk, and moose rather than megafauna
(Custer 1990).

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Paleoindian Period

One of the most intensely researched topics in North American
prehistory is the earliest human occupation, the Paleoindian
period. It is not simply time which veils the most ancient
American lives; it is also the strangeness of attempting to
understand completely new adaptations in an environment without any
modern counterpart. Analogies are limited not only for ecological
conditions but also for various components of behavior and culture
such as economy, mobility, and social interaction.

There are very few sites of the Paleoindian period in the Potomac
Basin but there are numerous isolated finds of diagnostic
artifacts. The first people to live in the Potomac River Basin
walked through a landscape that would be completely unfamiliar to
us today. Exactly when they arrived we do not know, but the area
certainly has been used by human groups since the end of the
Pleistocene era, about 10,000 years ago. They came in waves of
migration which swept the continent. For about half a millennium
there was an impressive spread of a distinctive artifact first
identified near the town of Clovis, New Mexico. The fluted Clovis
point spread throughout the New World from about 11,500 to 10,800
years ago, probably carried by a wave of migrating peoples who
entered the North American continent via Beringia (the Bering Land
Bridge). There are numerous claims throughout the Americas for
dates of human occupation much earlier than the 12,000 or so years
that has been long accepted (e.g., Dillehay 1986, Dillehay and
Collins 1988). None of the claims is noncontroversial, however.
In western Pennsylvania, Meadowcroft Rockshelter has yielded the
earliest radiocarbon date in the eastern United States, potentially
dating human occupation to over 19,000 years ago. The claims for
Meadowcroft have been vigorously contested and defended in the
archeological literature. The excavator and others (Adavasio et
al. 1988:58) recently wrote that humans were in the area "as early
as ca. 16,000 B.P. and certainly before 11,300 + 700 B.P." The
earliest occupations at Meadowcroft may be the clearest indication
of pre-Clovis occupation in the east, but that very possibility is
controversial among archeologists. The earliest widely accepted
sites are those with Clovis occupations.

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY/PALEOINDIAN 83


=== Page 114 ===

The Paleoindian period as a whole was originally identified by
archeologists as initial pre-Holocene adaptation. The only
unambiguous chronological diagnostics are fluted points and,
although these are highly variable, they tend to be lumped together
into an often undifferentiated time period. Kenneth Tankersley and
Barry Isaac identify the lack of chronological control in
Paleoindian studies as a primary challenge for the field. They
(1990b:xiv) write,
Assuming fairly rapid cultural change, commensurate with rates
of change in the nonhuman environment over most of the region
at the Pleistocene/Holocene interface, the mixing of Early
Holocene cultural materials with those from the Late
Pleistocene confounds any attempt to reconstruct the cultural
adaptations of the earliest inhabitants.
That is, without strict time control, archeologists will be unable
to understand either Pleistocene adaptations or the changes that
correlated with the shift in geological eras.

Researchers in the mid-Atlantic do not agree on the dates for the
Paleoindian period. Expectedly, due to the uncertain time of human
entry, beginning dates vary. Michael Barber and Eugene Barfield
(1989) give 12-10,000 to 8000 BCE as the time span. Paul Inashima
(1986) cites traditional chronology as 10,000 - 8000 BCE. The
Maryland State Preservation Plan ends the period at 7500 BC and
William Gardner (1983) ends it at 6500, including in the
Paleoindian period the diagnostic point types which many other
researchers place in the Early Archaic.

Gardner and Robert Verrey (1979) divide the eastern Paleoindian
period into three subperiods based on point styles: Clovis, Mid-
Paleo, and Dalton-Hardaway. Gardner (1989:9) provides the
following dates for these phases.

Paleoindian I (Clovis) date between 9500 and 8000 BCE. This phase
is marked by a typical eastern Clovis point, which is a narrow,
fluted, lanceaolate biface with concave base, partial edge grinding
and lateral pressure retouch and fluting scars.

Paleoindian II (Mid-Paleo) appears by at least 8600 BCE. The Mid-
Paleo point is smaller, thinner and more markedly fluted. Ebright
(1992:28) rejects the Mid-Paleo point type, although agrees that a
middle Paleoindian subperiod may be a valid concept.

The Paleoindian III (Dalton) phase is over by at least 8000 BCE.
The Hardaway-Dalton point type is roughly triangular with deeply
concave base and prominent ears and much reduced fluting.

David Anderson (1990) notes that this generally accepted division
corresponds to I: initial colonization and exploration; II:
settling in and establishing regional population concentrations;
and III: switching to Holocene conditions and adaptations.

This plan adopts the traditional end-date for the period at 8000
BCE, recognizing that careful chronological control within the

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY/PALEOINDIAN 8&4


=== Page 115 ===

late Pleistocene and early Holocene is critical. Adopting the
early-middle-late division of the time period should encourage more
careful control and less lumping, as Tankersley and Isaac
recommend.

Commenting on tool types and technology, Carol Ebright (1992:29)

writes that the:
Paleoindian tool kit is exceptionally uniform over most of the
continental United States. Non-projectile point flaked stone
tools are nearly exclusively unifacial in character, including
both formal tool types such as end and side scrapers, limaces,
gravers and perforators, and heavily-retouched flake tools.
Pieces esqillees are well-documented from eastern sites.
Workmanship is uniformly excellent, with a technological
sophistication unmatched until the much-later Hopewell
florescence in the Middle Woodland subperiod. Bone tools have
been recovered from many Western Paleoindian sites; their
virtual absence in the East is undoubtedly due to lack of
preservation.

Commenting on other aspects of paleoindian assemblages, Robert
Humphrey and Mary Elizabeth Chambers (1985:9) comment that there is
“significant variation among artifacts both in minor detail and
major forms" and a “bewildering variety in Paleoindian artifact
complexes." Some of this variation is certainly due to function,
and stylistic or chronological differences may be due to functional
needs, but there are other reasons, including the large number of
microenvironments and, as environments changed, regional and
seasonal variation.

John Cavallo (1981:15-16) notes that a mix of "aberrant"
Paleoindian point forms fits in with idea of regionalization of
styles in the late Paleoindian/Early Archaic which has been
suggested by various researchers.
Whether the diversity of styles during this phase is due to
the disappearance of later Pleistocene herbivores, the growth
and dispersal of Paleo-Indian populations, a technological
shift, or cultural lag, remain questions to be addressed by
future research.

The single diagnostic artifact is the fluted point, usually made of
high quality cryptocrystalline. Other lithics include scrapers
gravers, wedges, and bifaces for hacking and chopping (LeeDecker et
al. 1991:6) as well as denticulates, burins, hammerstones, and
utilized flakes. Michael Johnson (1989) discusses some of the
extensive variability of paleoindian lithic technology.

Theodore Reinhart (1989) emphasizes the diversity of point types in
eastern compared to western North America. He (1989a:180) issues
a warning about the overreliance on single diagnostic forms:
If we use only the presence or absence of the fluted point for
identification we may lack the ability to clearly determine
the actual progression of cultural developments and associated
changes in population demographics and subsistence.

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY/PALEOINDIAN 8&5


=== Page 116 ===

Smith (1990) is concerned about an overemphasis on lithic
technology in interpreting Paleoindian life. Where preservation is
good, an elaborate bone and ivory technology is revealed. He
points out that stone points are the most expendable parts of a
weapons system. That is, hafts, handles, foreshafts, and shafts are
likely to be the most heavily curated implements in the weapons
systems, and possibly within the whole of Paleoindian material
culture.

General Environmental Parameters during the Archaic

The Archaic was characterized by generally modern (Holocene)
climatic conditions, although that is not to say that the landscape
suddenly looked like today's. There continued to be complex
changes. The ancient Susquehannah River, ancestral to the
Chesapeake Bay, began to be submerged by encroaching water circa
10,000 BP, but the infilling of the Bay was not complete until
about 5,000 BP. The formation of the Potomac basin then, as we
know it, presented a slowly changing landscape to humans for
thousands of years.

Custer (1986) emphasizes the consequences of the major geologic and
climatic changes in place by 5000 BP. First, the dramatic
reduction in the rate of sea level rise and the stabilization of
the Bay allowed the stability of estuarine settings and the
development of extensive shellfish beds and fishspawning habitats.
Second, there was dramatic change in vegetation as hickory and pine

increased and grasslands spread. Major changes in streamflow
patterns and aoelian erosion and deposition and the drying of
ephemeral and minor streams were also important. Both of these

developments affected human settlement patterns from 5000 to 1000
BP (3000 BCE - 1000 CE) as people shifted their attention to the
rich and predictable resources on major rivers and estuarine
marshes (Custer 1986).

Overview; Material Characteristics of the Archaic

The Archaic period was so-named in the 19th century to designate an
outdated wandering way of life, a perception now itself outdated.
The period covers a long time and traditionally includes hunter-
gatherer lifeways during the Holocene. With a growing
understanding of the complexity of both hunting-gathering lifeways
and the development of agriculture, the definition of the period is
more nebulous. The end of the Archaic is usually marked by the
innovation of pottery, traditionally regarded as a Woodland period
trait. General trends of the Archaic have been traditionally
identified as population growth and greater dependence on food
gathering relative to hunting as well as the absence of
agriculture, ceramics, and settled village life. The definition of
Archaic lifeways continues to be refined by modern archeologists.

II, OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY/PALEOINDIAN 86


=== Page 117 ===

Adaptation to the emerging modern environment is one of the primary
ecological challenges through the Early and Middle Archaic. One of
the primary issues identified as of anthropological interest during
the Archaic is the development of sedentism. James Brown (1983:8)
writes the "[t]}he proper objective of this interest in settlement
analysis is to monitor the development toward sedentary settlement
systems." But there is much of cultural interest during the
Archaic. As emphasized above in the section on archeological
logic, there is a growing realization that Hunter-Gatherer social
and cultural complexity is an important topic and that non-food-
producers are not necessarily simple or even egalitarian.

James Phillips and James Brown (1983) date the Archaic in American
Midwest from 10,000 to 2500 years ago. Mark Wittkofski (1991b)
ends the Late Archaic in Virginia at the same time. It is common
in the mid-Atlantic to distinguish a Terminal Archaic or
Transitional overlap between the Late Archaic and the Early
Woodland. In this plan, however, 1,200 BCE is used as the end of
the Archaic and the beginning of the Woodland because pottery
appears in the region by this time. The dates used here are Early
Archaic: 8,000-6,000 BCE, Middle Archaic: 6,000-4,000 BCE, Late
Archaic: 4,000-1,200 BCE.

The Archaic chronological and typological sequence is relatively
well defined but it is based upon widely scattered sites ina large
region from the Delaware valley to the Carolina Piedmont and from
the Atlantic coast to the Ohio valley. Such a broad area has led
to some typological confusion (Ebright 1992:30). Naming types
without adequate definition is a problem as well. Ebright
(1992:30) notes that "[tjhe end result has been a plethora of named
types for the Archaic, many of which overlap morphologically and
temporally, or constitute such a small sample that a type
designation is inappropriate." It is for this reason that a
limited number of point types is listed in Table II.3 in this plan.

Because many Archaic sites in the region are plowed and possess
multiple components, control is limited as well. Clarence Geier
(1990) cites some limitations for Early and Middle Archaic sites:
1) there are few stratified or other sites in the mid-Atlantic; 2)
virtually all site assemblages are limited to lithics; and 3) there
is a lack of paleoenvironmental data. Simple logic demands a more
diverse tool kit than the one represented by limited lithics.
There are hints of complex technology, for example, in basketry
impressions and bone tools (Geier 1990).

Trends during the Early through Middle Archaic subperiods include
(Geier 1990):
1. population increase into the Late Archaic; only New England
underwent possible population decline after the Paleoindian
period;
2. broader range of environments during Archaic; technologies
developed to maximize resource use and ecosystem complexity;
3. use of lithic raw materials is best known part of Archaic
systems due to preservation; increased reliance on locally

II. OVERVIEW; CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 87


=== Page 118 ===

available resources, bipolar reduction technologies more
common;
4. introduction of ground stone techniques.

Jeffrey Hantman (1990b) cites the paucity of Early and Middle
Archaic sites in good context but is more concerned with the
conceptual problem in considering the Early and Middle Archaic as
period of little change, defined more by what they lacked than by
what they had. Instead of assuming linear, directional change
leading toward Woodland horticulture, archeologists need to focus
on how and why cultural adaptations varied in time and space
through the Early and Middle Archaic. For example, permanent
habitations, multi-regional exchange, storage, and specialized
plant gathering occurred during the earlier Archaic. Even formal
cemeteries are during found in the Middle Archaic and perhaps
earlier. Generally "it has been recognized that a normative stage
concept does us little good in understanding the variation extant
in the archaeological record of the first 4000 years of the
Archaic" (Hantman 1990b:135), Hunter-Gatherers don't simply
respond to a changing environment but create it. Phillips (1983:4,
quoted in Hantman 1990:135) writes:
We cannot view the Archaic period...as monolithic, nor
represented by a single mode of existence. [There were] many
modes of life, from foragers to collectors, to harvesters and
semi-agriculturalists; and, although changes in the
environment spurred new adaptive strategies, it is just as
true that these adaptive strategies structured and changed
their environment.

In the American Midwest, Brown (1983) notes that there is similar
technology and economy across the area from Missouri to Kentucky
during the Archaic. A number of issue and topics concerning Archaic
period hunters and gatherers is raised in the edited volume by
Phillips and Brown (1983). Many of the following points are
relevant to the mid-Atlantic and Potomac Basin as well as the
Midwest and are certainly not exhaustive.

1) The Archaic period includes a very broad range of

adaptations;

2) the Late Archaic use of weedy seeds and domestication of

native plants as well as tropical squash, horticulture and

regional exchange;

3) the effects of Hypsithermal drying on upland and lowland

occupation;

4) the relative seasonal group size in and use of upland and

lowland areas;

5) identifying local group size and season of occupation;

6) trend to sedentism and increasing duration of occupation

after 7000 BP;

7) territorial marking by groups, social identity, political

units, social reproduction, and workforce composition;

including the territorial exclusion and emergence of cemetery

markers as territorial claims of social groups;

8) ceramic innovations;

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 88


=== Page 119 ===

9) Holocene landscape changes and their effect on site
preservation and discovery, indicating the need to look for
buried as well as surface sites.

Several authors stress the importance of understanding
geomorphology in understanding Archaic sites and changes through
the period (e.g., Ebright 1992; Kay 1983, Wiant et al. 1983).
Holocene landscape changes, for example have 1) buried or destroyed
Archaic alluvial sites and 2) deflated interfluvial, upland sites
(Kay 1983). Usually stratification is obliterated in deflated
sites and the sequence must be inferred through typology. Johnson
(1983) notes that in the Potomac Valley, sedimentation above the
Fall Line has buried early sites under as much as 15 ft of
alluvium. Curry and Ebright (1989) document major geomorphological
changes in the mid-Atiantic, resulting in the deep burial of
Paleoindian and Archaic sites in ridgetop settings.

General Environmental Parameters during the Early Archaic

The general characteristics of the Preboreal/Boreal paleoclimatic
episode from 8,000-6,500 BCE are:
increase in duration of southern air masses; slight increase
in temperature and reduction of cloudiness; reduction of open
grasslands and spread of forests dominated by pine and
northern hardwoods [LeeDecker et al. 1991:27].

Pollen cores at the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line in

Prince Georges County, Maryland indicate the following from 10,800-

7,600 BP (8,800-5,600 BCE):
Birch-Oak-Goldenrod assemblage; warming climatic conditions
indicated by a dramatic increase in birch and decrease in
spruce and pine; oak increases; alder decreases but remains
plentiful; hazelnut, beech, ash and walnut present; wood-fern
and cinnamon fern increase during this period; black gum and
blueberry appear near the end of this period; landscape
possibly has some open areas colonized by goldenrod [LeeDecker
et al. 1991:32].

Deciduous trees increase and therefore the carrying capacity of
forests increases as more forage is available to support a larger
deer population.

After 6,500 BCE, with bifurcate diagnostics, marsh and swamp
habitats began to emerge, providing new ecological zones which
humans took advantage of. There is evidence in the Middle Archaic
for an increase in plant processing.

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Early Archaic

Archaeologists disagree over the terminology and placement of the
peoples who followed the Paleoindian migration into the mid-

Atlantic region. The Early and Middle Archaic are the most poorly
known periods in the region. There are relatively few sites. The
sea level continued to rise in this period and other Holocene
shifts buried or destroyed sites as well.

The Early Archaic may be subdivided into several phases; Laurie
Steponaitis (1980), for example, splits it into five. Here,
however, two will suffice: the early Early Archaic, marked by
notched points, and the late Early Archaic, marked by bifurcate-
based points. There are disagreements over the inclusion of
bifurcates in Early or Middle Archaic.

Custer (1990) dates the Early and Middle Archaic from 10,000-5000
BP. He would include bifurcates (8500-8000 BP) in the Middle rather
than the Early Archaic.

Gardner and his associates (e.g., Gardner 1989) believe that there
is essentially continuity from the earliest Paleoindian settlement
through the early Early Archaic that may be characterized as a
terrace-oriented base camp pattern.

Synthesizing from the Flint Ridge Complex in the Shenandoah Valley
(Thunderbird and Fifty sites) Gardner (1974a,b) sees a three-phase
continuum related to point shifts: corner notched
(Palmer/Kirk/Amos) to side notched (Warren/Big Sandy/Kessell) to
stemmed (Kirk Stemmed). The tool kit for Paleoindians and (early)
Early Archaic included side, end and concave scrapers, single and
multiple gravers, wedges or bipolar tools, denticulates, burins,
bifacial tools such as scrapers, choppers, knives, and preforms,
utilized flakes, hammerstones, and split cobble abraders. The
toolkit is also marked by the absence of food grinding stones,
chipped stone axes, pitted hammerstones and anvils, and drills.
Changes in the Early Archaic include changes in hafting techniques
(Geier 1990).

At the Shawnee-Minisink site the end and side scrapers of the
Paleoindian period become larger and more roughly made in the Early
Archaic. Early Archaic tools are more multifunctional than
specialized; a perforator/drill is introduced. By the end of the
Early Archaic the tool kit includes slug shaped, keeled and flake
endscrapers, snapped flake scrapers; flake knives; spokeshaves;
"nutting stones" and quartz crystal punches (Geier 1990; McNett
1985).

The Corner-notched tradition is widespread through the Southeast
and southern mid-Atlantic as well as West Virginia. Temporally
diagnostic points include Palmer corner-notched and Kirk corner-
notched. The Corner-Notched tool kit is probably similar to that
of the Paleoindian, as evidenced at Flint Run, including scrapers,
gravers, denticulates, drills, bruins, hammerstones, utilized
flakes, and knives. At the St. Albans site there are also chipped
hoes or grubbing tools (Broyles 1971:39). Maureen Kavanaugh notes
rhyolite use in the Piedmont. Steponaitis (1980) also notes more
rhyolite use in lower Patuxent River drainage and considers that

Tl. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 99


=== Page 121 ===

this could indicate the beginning of trade. It may also indicate
the continuation of extensive mobility over large areas. There was
a continued preference for high quality cryptocrystalline lithic
sources,

The Bifurcate tradition is similarly widespread and includes Deeply
notched bases and side notched: St. Albans side-notched, LeCroy,
and Kanawha stemmed. Tools include knives, scrapers, hammerstones,
drills, and hoes (Broyles 1971). Rhyolite is used as a primary
lithic with quartz and quartzite in Baltimore county, Anne Arundel,
Prince Georges, and Frederick Counties in Maryland. There is more
use of local lithic materials in bifurcate points.

The Bifurcate tradition is placed in the Early Archaic by some
researchers and in the Middle Archaic by others. Much of the
primary research on bifurcate occupations is from the South
Atlantic United States and interpretations are extended throughout
the Eastern Woodlands (Anderson 1991b). Bifurcates are associated
with Eastern deciduous forests from the Mississippi to the Atlantic
and from the Great Lakes to the Fall Line but are not in Florida,
the Gulf or the Lower Atlantic Coastal Plain. Bifurcate point
styles identified and dated in the southeast include St. Albans,
6900-6500 BCE; LeCroy, 6500-5800 BCE; and Kanawha, 6100-5800 BCE.
Anderson (1991b) offers some general observations about changes
during the late Early Archaic. Besides the obvious change in point
form there are pronounced changes in toolkit composition toward
expedient technologies. That is, earlier assemblages with formal,
curated tools such as gravers and hafted scrapers were replaced
with situational tools; utilized flakes became much more prevalent.
Wide-ranging mobility in the earlier Early Archaic, indicated by a
great deal of extralocal lithic material, was followed by decreased
mobility and circumscribed territories, indicated by more use of
local raw materials. In the South Atlantic by the beginning of the
Middle Archaic, there was year-round occupation within small
territories (Anderson 1991b).

The Early Archaic assemblage of stone tools is like that of the
Paleoindian period in that there a predominance of unifacial tools
and a continued use of high-quality cherts. It is different in
that the range of raw materials expands later in the period, with
intense rhyolite exploitation in Maryland, and the range of tool
types and techniques increases. For example, there are
hammerstones, manos and metates as well as flaked stone celts and
"hoes." In the Tennessee valley there is an increase in the use of
bipolar reduction (Ebright 1992:32).

During both Paleoindian and the Early Archaic periods people
carefully managed a curated biface tool technology. It is possible
that changes in tool technologies approximately 9000 BP marked a
change in mobility. The number of productive habitats increased
and the need to travel over great ranges decreased. There may also
have been a rise in population density (Custer 1990). Ebright
(1992:32) writes, "The increasing use of local, often inferior

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 91


=== Page 122 ===

materials and generalization tool forms imply a less mobile
lifestyle in a more predictable environment."

Another change in the Early Archaic is the expansion into a wider
variety of settings. There is also less curation of tools and a
drift away from the restricted raw material preferences observed in
the earlier period. It is evident that regional differences were
appearing at by the Early Archaic in projectile types, mode of
lithic tool manufacture, and associations of diverse point types.

General Environmental Parameters during the Middle Archaic

Funk (1991) suggests that there is no reason to expect anything
other than modern environmental restrictions during the Middle
Archaic in New York. However, Stewart and Cavallo (1991:21)
characterize the era as not directly comparable to current
conditions, although this is when the first fully deciduous
Holocene forests exist.

The Atlantic paleoclimatic episode from 6500-3100 BCE is

characterized by:
sharp reduction in duration of Arctic air masses; appearance
of modern environmental conditions--early part of period
characterized as warm and humid, while later part was
increasingly dry; full appearance of modern environment with
Warm, moist conditions; continental climate with marked
seasonal differences; widespread dominance of mesic oak-
hemlock forests; establishment of modern faunal communities;
expansion of deer and turkey populations [LeeDecker et al.
1991:27]}.

Analysis of pollen cores dating 7660-5000 BP (5660-3000 BCE) at the

Indian Creek V site indicates:
Oak-Hazelnut-Cinnamon Fern-Sedge assemblage; moist, warm
conditions indicated by disappearance of spruce and fir and
reduction of pine and birch; oak, hazelnut, and alder are the
dominant arboreal species; maple, black gum, beech, ash and
walnut are present but in low numbers; cinnamon fern is the
dominant herbaceous species; sedges reach their climax and
elderberry first appears during this period [{LeeDecker et al.
1991:32].

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Middle Archaic

There are very few intact Middle Archaic contexts in the mid-
Atlantic. "So little data is present, in fact, that some
researchers in the Middle Atlantic do not even recognize the
existence of a Middle Archaic subperiod in certain areas (e.g.,
Kinsey 1972)" (Ebright 1992:33).

Stewart (1991b) notes that, regardless of how it is labeled, the
time between 6500 and 3000 BCE is some of the least known in the

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 32


=== Page 123 ===

mid-Atlantic. In spite of the acknowledged dearth of information
on the Middle Archaic, Stewart (1991b) offers the following general
trends for the period, in which he includes occupations associated
with bifurcate-based points (6500-5800 BCE). As a result of a
growing population adapting to a seasonal, more fully deciduous
forest, there are

1) more sites than earlier,

2) a broadened resource base and seasonal emphases on suites of
resources,

3) more frequent reuse of individual sites, and

4) increasing emphasis on locally available raw materials for tool
production.

Keith Egloff and Joseph McAvoy (1990) date the Middle Archaic from
6500/6000 to 2500 BCE and use the following criteria:

1) increase in ground stone tools;

2) warmer and drier climate;

3) diffusion east from central plains;

4) use of shellfish;

5) increase in use of hickory nuts;

6) less use of end scrapers and unifacial tools;

7) introduction of net sinkers; and

8) minimal curation of tools.

Material is added to the toolkit for an apparently growing emphasis
on woodworking and plant processing. Ground stone tools, such as
grooved axes, pestles, mortars, and atlatl weights appear. There is
more reliance on bifacially flaked tools as unifacially flaked

tools, including scrapers, become scarce. New features include
stone-lined hearths on prepared floors (Geier 1990). Ebright
(1992:34) states that there is more use of poorer quality lithics,
but that these are often from nonlocal sources. There is also

extensive use of bone and antler documented in Tennessee.

Although not well known in the mid-Atlantic, the Middle Archaic was
clearly an important time period. In the midwest, Late Archaic
characteristics such as multiseason base camps, permanent
habitations, multiregional exchange, and specialized plant
gathering are all projected back more than 5000 years. While the
mid-Atlantic Middle Archaic is too poorly understood for any such
projections, a warm and dry climatic episode, analogous to the
Midwestern Hypsithermal from 8500-5100 BP, affected most sections
of the eastern United States (Joyce 1988). Some researchers
attribute major changes, including sedentism, during the Middle
Archaic to adaptations to changing environmental productivity.

Whether developing during the Middle or Late Archaic, changes in
mobility toward sedentism have certain implications and
archeological correlates. Certainly, sedentism is interrelated
with population growth, the development of food production, storage
technologies, property accumulation, and labor organization.
Archeological correlates include 1) more permanent facilities of
all types, 2) increase in the organization of these facilities, and

several effects in food remains, raw material use, and material
culture (Brown and Vierra 1983).

General Environmental Parameters during the Late Archaic

The major environmental change was the infilling of the Chesapeake
Bay and concomitant development of estuarine resources. The first
known use of shellfish is seen about 2,100-2,000 BCE at the start
of Broadspear tradition at the White Oak Point site on the Potomac
(Waselkov 1982) and along the Coan River (Potter 1982).

The Subboreal paleoclimatic episode from 3,100-800 BCE may be

characterized as:
Warm, dry climate (mid-postglacial xerothermic, circa 2350-
200BC) at the beginning of the episode, followed by gradually
increasing moisture and cooling temperatures; dry conditions
led to spread of grasslands and reduction of oak-dominated
forests; reduction in the rate of sea level rise permits
florescence of estuarine environments in coastal areas
{LeeDecker et al. 1991:27].

The most significant vegetational change was around 5000 BCE with
the Coastal Plain pine expansion and the paneastern hemlock decline
(Joyce 1988).

Pollen cores from the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line in

Prince Georges county, Maryland indicate the following from 5,000-

3,860 BP:
Oak-Cinnamon-Fern assemblage; warm, dry climatic conditions
indicated by the dominance of oak and increased in hickory and
pine; alder and birch decrease and hazelnut disappears with
only sporadic occurrences in later ones; dominant nonarboreal
species include cinnamon fern, which peaks during this period,
and blueberry, elderberry, arrowwood, and buckwheat {LeeDecker
et al. 1991:32].

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Late Archaic

Some researchers find it useful to combine traditionally identified
Late Archaic with Woodland time periods. Stewart (1980) calls the
traditional chronological divisions irrelevant in the Great Valley
province. Mark Wittkofski (1991b) dates the combined period of
Late Archaic and Early Woodland from 3000-500 BCE. Custer (1984)
would prefer a time division of Woodland I, encompassing
traditional Late Archaic, Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland,
since there is evidence of sedentism and increasing social
complexity throughout the time span. The Fairfax County, Virginia
plan (Table II.2) follows this suggestion.

Throughout the eastern United States archeologists have observed
the same general trends during the Late Archaic as people
increasingly focused their energy on riverine, estuarine, or
lacustrine settings and resources and developed more sedentary

settlement systems. Changes in natural environment and population
pressure have been the most commonly cited causes (Hodges 1991).

A meaningful goal, though, is not simply to attribute changes in
human strategies to external causes, but to address human choices
and responses in the face of major changes: response to new
resource availability with different organization of labor and
production, storage and the distribution of surplus; responses to
decreased mobility and demographic changes in terms of social
authority and control.

Mouer (199la) offers the Halifax Complex as the archetypical Late
Archaic culture, relying on a "sylvan adaptation" on the James
River Piedmont. Late Archaic adaptations until approximately 2500
BCE can be briefly summarized as having a forest specialization
with more flexibility on the Coastal Plain than in the Piedmont
due to the more patchy resources of the former environment. People
would live in small groups which would occasionally aggregate but
would have relatively low levels of regional interaction (Mouer
1991a).

The transition between the Archaic and the Woodland period,
sometimes labeled as the Terminal Archaic (see Table II.2) or as
the Transitional, correlates with environmental change as the
Chesapeake Bay estuaries were formed and estuarine resources as
well as anadromous fish became available.

This transitional period witnessed changes in every aspect of
archeologically-visible culture: site size, density and number;

technology, settlement, and subsistence. The major economic
changes are marked by the diagnostics of Savannah River and
Susquehanna broadspears, steatite bowls, and ceramics. A new,

riverine focus is noticed all along the eastern United States and
there is also an increased subsistence focus on fishing and
probably on drying and storing fish. Trade in steatite and other
material indicates much broader regional interaction.

Three basic models have been offered for the Archaic to Woodland
transition in Virginia (Hodges 1991). One considers the Late
Archaic Savannah river tradition of the James River Coastal Plain
and Piedmont to be a result of migration of riverine people from

the south (Mouer, Ryder and Johnson 1981). A second sees the
development as in situ, resulting from increasing efficiency
permitted by environmental changes (Gardner 1984). A third

considers it to be the result of both environmental change and
population growth (Catlin, Custer and Stewart 1982).

McLearen (1991:91) identifies the following trends in Late Archaic
technology in Virginia:
(1) the use of a number of stemmed and notched projectile
point and knife forms which vary on a regional basis at the
beginning and end of the period;

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 95


=== Page 126 ===

(2) in contrast to the above, a temporally overlapping
proliferation of the Savannah River broadspear and its related
large biface industry;

(3) localized manifestations of tools/points identical to
those of other broadspear complexes which are typical of the
northeast;

(4) some regional preferences in lithic types;

(5) use of some ground stone ad the first recognized use of
the ground stone grooved axe;

(6) the use of large, heavy tools, usually on quartzite,
numerous expedient tools on flakes, and the apparent addition
of a few more formalized tools the in earlier times;

(7) the quarrying of soapstone, the manufacture of stone
vessels, and the distribution of these vessels statewide and
beyond; and

(8) on most intensively occupied sites, larger and more
numerous hearths and, in general. slightly more variety in
types as opposed to earlier periods,

General Environmental Parameters during the Woodland

Woodland period adaptations were achieved in a modern climate with
relatively minor fluctuations. Microenvironments could, of course,
vary between locales.

The Sub-Atlantic paleoclimatic episode from 800 BCE to the present
may be characterized:
Cooling reduced the moisture stress of the Sub-Boreal, leading
to essentially modern conditions; upland forests include a mix
of coniferous and deciduous species [LeeDecker et al 1991:27].

Pollen cores taken at the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line in
Prince Georges County, Maryland indicated the following from 3,860-
1,770 BP:
Herbaceous assemblage; dramatic decrease of all tree pollen
and influx of legumes, elderberry, blueberry, and arrowwood;
oak is the dominant arboreal species; pollen assemblage is
indicative of a landscape covered with herbaceous plants
[LeeDecker et al. 1991:32].

For the period 1,770-350 BP, pollen cores indicate;
Ericaceae (blueberry etc) assemblage; continued reduction of
arboreal species; Ericaceae increase but other herbaceous
species disappear; cattail is present only during this
interval; cooler climatic conditions [LeeDecker et al,
1991:32].

Francine Bromberg (1987) characterizes the Woodland
microenvironments of the Inner Coastal Plain, Outer Coastal Plain,
and the Piedmont Uplands as follows.

Piedmont Uplands. In the Piedmont uplands different resources are
available in the uplands and on the floodplains. In the oak-

II, OVERVIEW; CHRONOLOGY /ARCHAIC 96


=== Page 127 ===

hickory and oak-chestnut forests of the uplands nuts are available
in the fall. Deer are especially concentrated to the west where
the forest edge meets the grasslands. Because deer's habits vary
according to season, human hunting strategy does as well:
individual stalking is more common in the summer and communal
hunting is pursued in the fall and winter. Other game animals
include squirrel, raccoon, and black bear. Puma, bobcat, wolves
and foxes are also available. Turkey congregate in the fall and
passenger pigeons would have been abundant before their extinction.
On the narrow floodplain there are also oaks and in the rivers and
streams there are both freshwater fish and anadromous fish such as
shad and white perch. Primary lithic resources are also available
in the uplands. Upland resources occur in great abundance
periodically and seasonally (Bromberg 1987:25-28).

Inner Coastal Plain. Nuts, turkey, cottontail rabbits, and deer
are available in the uplands. In the tidal freshwater marshes are
tubers from fall to spring, seeds, and freshwater mussels. From
inland marshes may be gathered fruits in summer, tubers, birds and
fish, as well as aquatic plants. Fish and anadromous fish are
present in the river and streams. The Inner Coastal Plain offers
a number of diverse and productive microenvironments (Bromberg
1987:29-34).

Outer Coastal Plain. There are a wide variety of resources in the
Outer Coastal Plain. The uplands, heavily dissected by streams,
contain resources largely similar to those of the Inner Coastal
Plain, although deer and turkey are less plentiful. The freshwater
tidal marshes and wooded inland marshes are similar to but with
less abundant resources than those of the Inner Coastal Plain.
Abundant waterfowl, marine fish, crabs, oysters, mussels, and clams
are some of the wide variety of resources in the Outer Coastal
Plain (Bromberg 1987:34-42).

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Woodland

The characteristics of the Eastern Woodland period generally are
identified as population increase, increased sedentism, manufacture
and widespread use of pottery, domestication of native plants,
adoption of imported domesticates, and the development of elaborate
mortuary practices. The famous Adena and Hopewell interaction
networks centered in Ohio and Illinois did not directly or greatly
affect material culture of much of the mid-Atlantic, although trade
networks penetrated the Appalachians and the Delmarva peninsula
(Humphrey and Chambers 1985). In the mid-Atlantic, there is a
seasonal hunting-gathering adaptation through the Middle Woodland
at least, although there may be some plant domestication as well.
In the mid-Atlantic, as in other parts of the eastern United
States, many of the characteristics of Woodland societies predate
cultigen use (see McBride and Dewar 1987).

Because they result from more sedentary populations, Woodland sites
tend to be internally complex, containing storage pits, structure

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 97


=== Page 128 ===

patterns, and burials. However, the Early Woodland is not well
known on the Maryland Coastal Plain and there is nearly no
excavated data from the Middle Woodland. Late Woodland sites are
better documented.

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Early Woodland

There is clear continuity between the transitional Archaic and
Early Woodland phases indicated by pottery development in both the
James and Potomac drainages. Marcey Creek, Seldon Island, and Elk
Island ceramics are nearly always found on the same sites and are
almost always near large Savannah River occupations (Mouer
1991a:47). Early Woodland material culture in the Potomac Inner
Coastal Plain and the Piedmont include Accokeek ceramics and small,
stemmed, foliate and broadly side-notched points. On the Outer
Coastal Plain are flat-bottom pots, jars and beakers and on the
Lower James River are Croaker Landing wares and related material
(Mouer 1991a).

Michael Klein and Thomas Klatka (1991:140) note that assigning
point types to the Early Woodland period is problematic due to
“blending of morphological attributes, the lack of associated
radiocarbon dates, or the persistence of these forms through time."
They are comfortable with the following as Early Woodland, although
other scholars may not agree: Vernon (unaccepted by some as a
separate point), Claggett, Calvert, Rossville (Piscataway), Potts
Corner-Notched, as well as Fishtail varieties dating 1,000 - 200
BCE. Others (e.g., Ebright 1992), however, assign Claggett to the
Late Archaic or would equate Claggett with Halifax points (S. R.
Potter personal communication). Nearby, Delmarva Adena points
consist of a series of side and corner-notched points of Ohio
cherts and there are also small basal-notched points. Secondary
lithic resources, small quartz cobbles, and bipolar technology are
commonly employed (Ebright 1992:39).

The Early Woodland witnesses a change in the use of lithics toward
the economical use of lithic resources in general for the Coastal
Plain and Piedmont. Point forms tend to get smaller and are made
with a wider variety of materials. On the Potomac Coastal Plain
small quartz stemmed points are associated with early ceramics. By
900 BCE there are smaller, contracting stemmed and lanceolate to
teardrop shaped points finished by pressure flaking. A wide
variety of lithic types are found as debitage and for other tools
as well as points (McLearen 1991b).

Early Woodland pottery is of several types. Keith Egloff (1991)
summarizes the development of ceramics during the Early Woodland in
Virginia, noting that early ceramics tend to be found as a few
sherds at many small sites. Data on early ceramics are sparse for
several reasons: 1) encampments are small; 2) sites seldom
revisited; 3) early ceramics do not have great time depth; and 4)
early low-fired vessels from unsuitable clays are poorly preserved
and therefore poorly represented in the archeological record. The

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 98


=== Page 129 ===

earliest pottery in the region is found along the Coastal Plain of
Virginia, in the Piedmont along the Potomac and James rivers, and
along the lower Shenandoah (see Table II.5.).

It is widely recognized but little addressed that the appearance of
pottery is complex and nonuniform in space and type in the eastern
woodlands (Sassaman 1993). Social and economic factors rather than
technological ones may account for differential acceptance of early
pottery. Kenneth Sassaman (1993) draws on gender relations as a
social variable to attempt to explain some of the patterns of early
pottery use during the archaic-woodland "transition."

Sassaman is correct in insisting that there is a gender/kin
Givision/allocation of labor issue in changing stone tool
technology and the development of pottery. The use of these two
technologies, as he writes, are expected to be "complementary and
interdependent." There are models for an apparent shift from
formal to expedient core reduction in flaked stone "degeneration,"
but in many places this change occurs as pottery appears.

Sassaman (1993) suggests that the consideration of gender adds a
needed dimension to understanding this shift. But Sassaman
understandably falls into the trap that Gero inadvertently set by
equating formal, diagnostic tools with men's production and
informal expedient, non-diagnostic tools with women's labor.
Odell's (1988) careful use-wear analysis negates any simple
correlations between hunting and finely-made temporally diagnostic
"points" or between women's work and crude, poorly made tools.

The origin of ceramics in Virginia may be locally evolved
technology inspired by soapstone bowls developing from either the
northern Susquehanna Broadspear/Soapstone bowl tradition or the
southern Savannah river broadspear/soapstone bowl tradition. It is
also possible that some Virginia pottery is derived from the fiber-
tempered pottery of the southeastern United States (Egloff 1991).

Egloff (1991) hypothesizes that the demand for soapstone vessels
may have been catalyst for inexpensive durable vessels. Soapstone
vessels are found as both thick, heavy containers and elegant, thin
bowls. Their manufacture seems to have been limited to areas where
stone was available, that is, the Piedmont. As production was
unable to keep up with demand, a new solution had to be developed.
Ceramic production was accepted first in areas far removed from
soapstone quarries. The earliest ceramics were shaped like
soapstone containers in a wide variety of vessel forms. The use of
soapstone vessels almost certainly continues with the late
acceptance of pottery in Virginia (Egloff 1991).

McLearen (1991:113-114) identifies six trends for Early Woodland
material culture:

1. There is a rapid phasing out of the broadspear, with

broadspear-derived, stemmed point forms--particularly
those of the Savannah River tradition--decreasing in size

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 99


=== Page 130 ===

and continuing into at least the first few hundred years
of the time period. By about 900-750 B.C., the large
biface tradition and preferred use of mainly coarse
materials has been replace by the use of a number of
small lanceolate, notched, and stemmed forms made on
quartz, chert, and various other lithic materials. A
rather economical use of lLithics predominates; the
regional preferences have broken down or have been
dramatically altered; and by at least the end of the
period, small tools are generally the norm.

2 Ground stone technology carries over from the Late
Archaic, with some of the same forms being used, but with
the addition of more elaborate and well-made polished
implements and ornaments.

3 Ceramics technology develops, followed by a dispersal of
a simple technology which is initially based on the model
of the stone bowl of the Late Archaic, Within an
extremely short period of time, an experimental stage in
pottery manufacture encompasses the entire region, with
full blown typical Woodland technology and vessel forms
by about 900 B.C. in most areas. There appears to have
been a lag in southwestern Virginia until this latter
technology is introduced from the south, perhaps ca. 600
B.C. or slightly earlier.

4. The rock cluster and hearth platform feature type

continues.

Se A few sites show pit forms which appear typical of
storage and cooking technology.

6. At one site there is evidence of architecture which is

not too dissimilar to late of later Woodland phases.

Bone and shell tools include splinter bone awls, deer antler tines,
bone and shell awls, shell beads, bone beamers and hair pins,
turtle shell bowls and cups and miscellaneous unidentified tools
(McLearen 1991:126).

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Middle Woodland

The Middle Woodland is traditionally dated ca. 500 BCE to 800/900
CE, but the chronology may be refined to subdivide Middle Woodland
I, 500 BCE-200 CE, and Middle Woodland II, 200-900 CE.

Middle Woodland I is marked by sand-tempered, net-impressed Popes
Creek pottery. Middle Woodland II is marked by coarse shell-
tempered types of pottery, including Mockley net-impressed, cord-
marked and plain. Associated diagnostic lithics include Selby Bay
points and knives and corner-notched Jacks Reef points as well as
Fox Creek (Steubenville) and Nomini points, which are found on the
Northern Neck of Virginia (Ebright 1992; Potter 1993).

There is a resurgence in technical sophistication in knapping

during this period. In the Coastal Plain non-local rhyolite and
high quality jaspers are preferred lithic materials. Selby Bay

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 100


=== Page 131 ===

points and knives are nearly always rhyolite while Jacks Reef are
usually chert (Ebright 1992).

The tool kit is diverse. With Popes Creek pottery are found such
tools as knives, grinding stones, mortars, axes, choppers,
hammerstones, and bone awls. With Mockley wares are found a
variety of tools and elliptical two-holed gorgets, hematite
squares, grinding stones, three-quarter grooved axes, bifacially
retouched flakes and reworked bone.

Middle Woodland II witnessed a major change in the organization of
groups. On the James River the change to permanent settlements
occurs between 200-800 CE. Similarly, on the Potomac Coastal
Plain, mobility decreases and group boundary definition increases
as very large midden sites appear after 550, probably closer to
700-900 CE (Potter 1993:140). Increasing localization of groups
took place during that time. For example, Northern Neck society
became more distinct from surrounding peoples south of the
Rappahannock basin, north of the Patuxent basin and west of the
Fall Line (Potter 1993:141).

The Middle Woodland saw interregional interaction, the continuation
and development of localized styles along with interregional
influences, increased sedentism, and evidence of non-egalitarian as
well as egalitarian societies. On the Coastal Plain the James
River marks the southern edge of the mid-Atlantic region (McLearen
1992).

McLearen (1992:41) summarizes;

From Delaware and Maryland throughout Coastal Virginia there
are shared traits, particularly from ca. A.D. 200 through 800
or 900. Such shared traits include the use of Mockley ware
ceramics in Middle Woodland II, Pope's Creek and related
ceramics in Middle Woodland I, some trade and exchange
networks involving Maryland or Pennsylvania metarhyolite which
is usually associated with Fox Creek/Selby Bay points and
bifaces of the Middle Woodland II Subperiod, and accumulations
of dense shell middens in the appropriate estuarine areas.
Along with these common traits are appearance of local non-
shell-tempered ceramic varieties which are concentrated in the
Inner Coastal Plain from the fall line to the saltwater-
freshwater transition.

Both Stewart (1992) and McLearen (1992) note the similarity of
elaborately decorated vessels between coastal Virginia and the
Delaware Valley. Stewart (1992:11) hypothesizes that these "highly
decorated ceramics functioned in public ceremonies, perhaps
feasting, related to the gathering of groups during annual fish
runs."

Several issues are critical to the exploration of Middle Woodland
material culture. The physical characterization of clays, clay
sources, and temper is necessary to identify trade items and
locally made and used items. A broader question requiring such

II, OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 101


=== Page 132 ===

information is connected to the interpretation of regional trends
in ceramic production (Stewart 1992:9). An issue related to stone
tool technology is the apparently changing relationship between
tool production and the presence of specialists. It is also
important to delineate the role of the bow and arrow in changes in
stone tool technology.

A new kind of feature appears during the Middle Woodland (and
likely earlier) to alter the cultural landscape. Burial mounds
were built in the Potomac Valley in Maryland and West Virginia and
the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. Stewart raises these issues
connected with burial mounds: public symbolism of mounds; role in
integrating communities and dispersed settlements; territory
covered by integrating mechanism of mound building. McLearen
(1992:52) suggests that mounds appearance and disappearance may
accompany the rising and falling of early ranked social systems.

Territoriality, that is, the definition and control of an area by

people, is a factor that becomes more important in the mid-Atlantic

during the Middle Woodland. Stewart (1992:20) writes,
What needs to be explored further with archeological data are
models of how territoriality was defined, communicated, and
enforced between groups; what was the nature of social
relations between these groups; and whether territoriality was
perceived or operated as a seasonal or year-round aspect of
the social system.

Other boundaries were forming as well. For most of prehistory
physiographic regions did not mark significant cultural boundaries,
but during the Middle Woodland divergent cultural adaptations
appeared in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont.

Randolph Turner (1978) has suggested that the Fall Zone was used as
a cooperative border zone for hunting and Mouer (1991b) suggests
that it was a political buffer zone. Hantman and Klein (1992)
suggest that both factors were probably relevant and that both
limited settlement in the area. Egloff (1985) proposes that this
boundary represents Algonquian and Siouan language groups.

One of the major issues is the nature of sociopolitical
organization of Piedmont groups during the Middle and Late
Woodland. At contact the Piedmont groups were the Monacan along
the James River drainage and the Manahoac along the Rappahannock.
These groups formed a single polity, but there is no detailed
ethnohistoric record comparable to the rich descriptions of the
Coastal Plain Algonquians.

The cultural boundary along the Fall Line between Algonquian
speakers of the Coastal Plain and Siouan speakers of the Piedmont
may have been initially defined much earlier in the Woodland (Mouer
1991a), but it is certainly archeologically identifiable around 900
CE (Potter 1993:142).

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 102

Overview: Material Characteristics of the Late Woodland

The beginning date for the Late Woodland is largely agreed to fall
between 800 - 1000 CE and the end, marked by contact between native
peoples and Europeans, is placed at either 1500, beginning a
protohistoric period, or ca. 1600, with the settlement of Jamestown
and John Smith's exploration of the Potomac River.

Depending upon location within the Potomac Basin, there are various
ways to subdivide the Late Woodland. In the Maryland Piedmont
there are at least three complexes. The Montgomery, marked by
Shepard pottery, dates from 1000-1450 CE. Mason Island, marked by
Page pottery, dates from 1400-1500 CE. Luray, marked by Keyser
pottery, dates from 1500-1600 CE. In the upper Shenandoah Valley,
Gardner (1983) splits the period into five phases based on specific
pottery types. For the Coastal Plain of the lower Potomac River,
Potter (1993) specifies three subperiods: Late Woodland I, 900-
1300; Late Woodland II, 1300-1500; and Protohistoric, 1500-1650.
The first is marked primarily by Rappahannock Incised pottery and
Levanna large triangular points. The second is marked by Potomac
Creek ware and associated Moyaone ware. Point types are primarily
Levanna small triangular points and small triangular "type A"
points, both of which persist into the protohistoric period.
Yeocomico ware appears as a protohistoric ware and several ceramic
types continued from the Late Woodland II into the protohistoric
and early historic period. These are Potomac Creek, Moyaone Plain,
Rappahannock Fabric-Impressed, simple Rappahannock Incised,
Townsend Corded, Potomac Creek Cord-marked, and Moyaone Cord-marked
(Potter 1993). Madison points are also characteristic of the Late
Woodland.

Egloff (1992:203) comments on the meaning of ceramic types:

For years archaeologist have defined ceramic wares as if they
represented particular groups of people that were
linguistically, socially, and politically connected. [In the
last twenty years, however, accumulating evidence suggest that
the distribution of ceramic wares do not’ correlate
consistently with the boundaries of linguistic or political
units. However, they do represent the § increasing
regionalization of cultures in the Late Woodland Period and
may reflect the type and intensity of interaction within and
between socially connected groups.

Blanton (1992:74,76) proposes regionalization during the Middle
Woodland as well, He provides maps of idealized culture areas
based on ceramic attributes. Within Virginia he delineates nine
during Middle Woodland I and ten during Middle Woodland II.

Although much research has been done on ceramics, minimal attention
has been paid to Late Woodland lithics "despite the presence of a
wide variety of implements ranging from such examples as flaked
projectile points and blades to ground axes and pipes" (Turner
1992:104).

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 103


=== Page 134 ===

Turner (1992) describes the rich material culture of the period.
Copper, often shaped as pendants and beads, was used as status
marker. The craft of clothing manufacture and decoration is
displayed elaborately in Powhatan's mantle, which was made of deer
hide decorated with thousands of small marginella beads. Shell was
fashioned into pendants, gorgets, beads, and stylized masks.
Beads, pins, and fishhooks were crafted from bone.

The most apparent and major change during the Late Woodland in the
mid-Atlantic is the establishment of large villages with economies
based on maize agriculture. It was during the latter part of this
period that major changes in social and political organization
occurred concurrently with this reliance on imported crops.
Populations aggregated to form large, albeit often dispersed,
villages as territorial and social boundaries became increasingly
distinct and important. Evidence for intergroup and interregional
hostility increased after 1400 (Potter 1993). The development and
dynamics of chiefdoms and competition among them have been some of
the most compelling research issues for archeology.

General Environmental Parameters during the Historic Period

Major changes due to large-scale deforestation and cultivation are
indicated by a ragweed assemblage in the pollen cores dating from
350 BP to the present at the Indian Creek V site near the Fall Line
in Prince Georges County, Maryland (LeeDecker et al. 1991:32).

The environment of the modern Chesapeake Bay area clearly is very
different from that used by Native Americans before European
contact. Henry Miller (1986) synthesizes archeological and
historical data to lend insight into ecological change in the
region and identify when human actions became a significant factor
in this change. During the 17th and early 18th centuries there was
little increase in sedimentation in the estuary and consistent soil
fertility, but by the latter half of the 18th century soil erosion
and stream siltation were having serious ecological effects. The
change was brought on by different land use practices, particularly
farming methods.

The single cash crop of tobacco dominated the Chesapeake economy
during colonial times. During the 17th century colonists worked
the fields in the Native American fashion of "slash and burn"
agriculture. In a new field trees were cut and the undergrowth
cleared and reduced to ashes by burning. The soil was worked with
hoes for planting corn or tobacco in little hills. After several
years of tobacco and a few years of corn harvests, the exhausted
field were left fallow for about 20 years. Because of the long
fallow periods only a small percentage of the land was worked every
year. Therefore, only small amounts of land were exposed and
vulnerable to erosion. Other aspects of the farming system also
reduced erosion and run-off into streams: the use of hills for
planting; stumps left in the fields; and vegetation bordering
worked fields (Miller 1986).

Il. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /WOODLAND 104


=== Page 135 ===

Late in the 18th century new methods of farming were adopted due to
demographic, economic, and social factors. Human population growth
rendered obsolete the long-term fallow system requiring 40-50 acres
of land per laborer. Land values rose and short term leases were
instituted. The intensive plow agriculture which replaced the
fallow system allowed no time for the soil to rejuvenate. Also,
during the 18th century the Piedmont was settled and cleared for
agriculture (Miller 1986).

The widespread adoption of plow agriculture in the Coastal Plain
and Piedmont produced major ecological changes in the Chesapeake
Bay watershed. Rainwater runoff increased; therefore more fresh
water entered the Bay and affected salinity. Soil erosion became
a serious problem. Sediment increased the turbidity of streams
and, because runoff contained phosphorous and nitrogen rich
topsoil, it affected the nutrient flow. Some of the changes were
very rapid. In the mid 18th century many of the creeks draining in
the Potomac were navigable. By 1807 Port Tobacco creek in Charles
County and Mattawoman, Piscataway, and East Branch creeks in Prince
Georges county were silting up and their ports abandoned (Miller
1986:183). Clearing of land for iron ore mining and production of
charcoal for iron furnaces also contributed to this erosion problem
(Cronin 1986:189).

Available archeological data on fish species strongly suggest that
major transformations in the ecology of the Bay's tributaries were
occurring by the early 19th century (Miller 1986:185).

Even if populations had already been affected, early 19th century
harvests were impressive. An 1835 report stated that 22,500,000
shad and 750,000,000 herring were caught in the Potomac River per
year (Cronin 1986:190). In contrast, Eugene Cronin (1986:193)
writes that presently "shad are so scarce from the combined effects
of over-fishing, damming of tributaries, and pollution that
Maryland has prohibited their capture since 1980" (Cronin
1986:193).

Changes in harvesting technologies and distribution during the 19th
century drastically affected the estuarine resources. Shallow
oyster beds were harvested in small quantities in the early part of
the century but the introduction of the deep-water dredge by
Connecticut oystermen brought the possibilities for greatly
increased harvests and damage to oyster beds (Cronin 1986:193).
Both Virginia and Maryland outlawed the use of the dredge in 1820
and 1830 respectively.

Cronin (1986:194) summarizes,
Between 1836 and 1890, about 400,000,000 bushels of oysters
were harvested in Maryland with virtually no effort to protect
brood stocks, avoid destruction of small oysters, enhance
reproduction, or take other protective measures despite the
detailed analysis, warnings, and recommendations of scientists
and surveyors... Natural reproduction was no longer replacing
the harvest.,..Oyster bars had been destroyed, enforcement of

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /HISTORIC 105



=== Page 136 ===

laws and regulations was weak, and the oyster wars were at
their worst.

During the 19th century concern about water quality focused on
sedimentation and local threats to health and aesthetics (Cronin
1986:197). Agricultural run-off, industrial waste, and pollution
from coal mining, in addition to household waste, created serious
pollution problems. Yellow fever, malaria, and cholera were common
but not explicitly connected to water quality. It took the
publicized occurrence of some students getting typhoid from oysters
to stimulate attempts to clean up parts of the estuary through the
establishment of sewage treatment plants. Cronin writes
(1986:197):
The oyster was to become the most potent single stimulus for
the control of domestic pollution around the Chesapeake....It
is widespread, accumulates pollutants, is eaten raw, has high
economic importance and has had remarkable political clout.

Andrew Marcus (1994:39) points out that
Only in the 20th Century has an appreciation grown for the
role that siltation plays in destroying spawning grounds,
generating turbidity, storing toxins and nutrients, and
drowning benthic habitats.

Awareness of the siltation problem in the later 18th and 19th
century focused instead on the detriment to navigation, as deep
water ports became useless for shipping. Currently, runoff still
presents the worst pollution problems in the lower Potomac.

Since the mid 18th century environmental constraints primarily have
been created by human action. These ecological changes have been
widespread and far reaching and they continue today.

Overview: Archeological Themes for the Historic period

Once archeological attention turns to historically documented
periods, the whole tone of investigation changes in response to the
often rich and always biased data that are available. Oddly,
historical archeology tends to ask both more and less sophisticated
questions than prehistory; this dual tendency is due, in part, to
the difficult methodological issues of integrating, challenging, or
confirming documentary data in addition to archeological data.
Archeology of historic periods is neither easier nor superfluous,
but it does require a somewhat different orientation and
methodology than that of prehistory. Consequently, this overview
is arranged differently from those preceding as it is assumed that
the reader is familiar with the basic trends of the historic
period.

Following are the historic theme subdivisions used by
preservationists in the region. Preservation plans tend to link
themes and time periods into categories general enough to cover the
sorts of cultural resources under their jurisdiction. Such

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /HISTORIC 106


=== Page 137 ===

categories are good for organizing information on resources and are
not meant to limit the questions one may ask within time periods.

The Maryland Comprehensive State Historic Preservation Plan
(Maryland Historic Trust 1986) divides the historic period into
only five subperiods. These are:

1. Contact and Settlement Period -- 1570-1750

2. Rural Agrarian Intensification -- 1680-1815

3. Agricultural-Industrial Transition -- 1815-1870
4. Industrial/Urban Dominance -- 1870-1930

5. Modern Period -- 1930 - present.

The Virginia Department of Historic Resources department (1991)
defines the following seven historic periods. These are:

1. 1607-1750 Settlement to Society

2. 1750-1789 Colony to Nation

3. 1789-1830 Early National

4. 1830-1861 Antebellum

5. 1861-1865 Civil War

6. 1865-1914 Reconstruction and Growth
7. 1914-1991 World War I to Present,

These divisions emphasizes the most general changes that
characterize these state histories.

The Fairfax plan, written for a more restricted area, is more
complex. There are ten study units for the historic period defined
in the Fairfax County Heritage Resource Management Plan (Chittenden
et al. 1988) These topical units overlap in time and therefore
indicate some of the complexity of attempting to segment centuries
of development into small time divisions. The Fairfax plan periods
are as follows:

1. Exploration and Frontier -- 1550-1675

2. Early Colonial Settlement -- 1650-1720

3. Tobacco Plantation Society -- 1720-1800

4, Free Black Society -- c. 1775-1861

5. Early Diversified Agriculture -- 1750-1840

6. Agrarian Fairfax -- 1840-1940

7. Quakers in Fairfax county -- 1840-1920

8. Civil War and Reconstruction -- 1860-1870

9. Fairfax Black Community -- 1861-1964
10.Suburbanization and Urban Dominance -- 1890 - present.

The District of Columbia's Preservation Plan (DCHPD 1991) contains
still more specific historic contexts. D.C.'s Historic contexts
are listed below. Only those subcategories with some relevance to
archeological issues are included.

Other historical archeological overviews simply use centuries as
divisions, allowing the research topic to guide the time frame
used. For example, Paul Shackel and Barbara Little (1994) divide
Historical Archaeology of the Chesapeake into four sections: Early
European Settlement, which is essentially the 17th century;
Plantation and Landscape Studies, which are relevant throughout the
historic period; 18th-century life; and 19th-century life. The
topics they point out for these time periods represent some of the
general archeological issues in the mid-Atlantic.

Concerning the 17th century, Shackel and Little (1994:17) write:
Conflict, cooperation, negotiation, and other forms of
interaction among the groups that inhabited the bay area are
central anthropological themes. Continual power struggles
between Europeans, Native Americans and Africans, and between
wealth groups, religions, and European and_ colonial
authorities characterize the period of early settlement as
well as later periods.

The ethnohistorical record of the Coastal Algonquians is an
invaluable source for understanding the Native American world at
the time of European settlement. Captain John Smith began his
travels on the Potomac River in June 1608. He and his men received
a hostile reception from the Powhatan groups and a friendly one
from the Conoy. He mapped settlements and described, from the
perspective of a military observer and strategist, the political
organization and general way of life of the people encountered
(Potter 1993).

Southern Algonquian groups inhabiting the Coastal Plain from
Maryland to North Carolina varied in the degree of sociopolitical
centralization but their organization "featured rank-differentiated
roles and functions, dress, and burial customs; polygyny;
matrilineal descent of chieftains; tribute systems; and trade
monopolies" (Potter 1989:152).

Powhatan, reigning from the late 1500s-1618, was the paramount
chief or mamanatowick of the Powhatan chiefdom. He inherited
small chiefdoms along the James and York rivers and expanded his
control eastward to the Bay, conquering the coastal chiefdoms. By
1608 Powhatan controlled all groups except the Chickahominies on
the James and York rivers. To the north was his chiefdom's
periphery, where he influenced but did not command. Groups on the
Potomac were influenced by their location between the two chiefdoms

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /HISTORIC 109


=== Page 140 ===

of Powhatan and Conoy. The Patawomekes were trying to maintain
autonomy from the Powhatan and the Tauxenents were under the
influence of the Conoy (Potter 1993:19).

In southern Maryland, groups were part of Conoy except those on the
Patuxent River. In both the Powhatan and Conoy chiefdoms there was
a hierarchy of political power.

There were both small and large settlements. Only two palisaded
villages are mentioned by Smith, but six villages are documented
archeologically. The houses of most villages were dispersed.
Settlements were arranged in longhouses which were functionally
specific structures, There were the werowance's (district chief's)
longhouse, mortuary temple and treasury, houses of associated
elite, commoners’ houses; household storage units, sweathouses, and
menstrual huts.

Shackel and Little (1994:149) write of 18th-century issues:
Research into the eighteenth century must deal with a host of
issues: subsistence and economic strategies; settlement
patterns; the group relations of class, race, ethnicity, and
gender; and cultural and political tensions between the mother
country and the colonies. The eighteenth century witnessed
transformations in every aspect of life, as the dominant
culture came under the influence of the rationalization of the
Enlightenment.

Plantations of all sizes were a critical arena of economic and
social interaction for much of the historic period. Historical
archeologists have begun to address
many of the social, political, and economic implications of
plantation economy, its place in a profit-making system, the
creation and integrity of an African American culture, and
implications for an archeology of racism today [{Shackel and
Little 1994:97].

During the 19th century, broad cultural changes took place. Shackel

and Little (1994:249) summarize:
The new culture of capitalism and its accompanying
standardized behavior were created and reinforced by the
spread of mass-produced goods throughout the century. But
this culture was far from homogenous, despite the innovation
of new transportation technologies, such as the railroad and
canals. Regionalism and rural and urban differences were not
erased. Not all people subscribed to the wage-labor system.
- « some industrialists used slave labor for manufacturing. .
- Others who continued to use slaves in their plantation
called on the ideological mechanism of historical precedent to
justify this practice. . . Industrialism obviously had a
tremendous impact on everyday social relations and influenced
class, gender roles, and ethnicity.

The 20th century, which is almost over, traditionally has not
provoked much archeological interest. The deficit of research is

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /HISTORIC 110


=== Page 141 ===

due only in part to the perceived overabundance of documentary
information and redundant site types. It is also due to a bias
against using archeology to examine the "present." Clearly, much
of importance occurred during the past century: two world wars and
several other major wars, pervasive technological developments
inside and outside the home; Prohibition; the Great Depression;
suburbanization, women's suffrage, and the struggle for Civil
Rights. These are not events which archeology should ignore; what
it may contribute will become evident during the next several
decades.

Table II.6 and II.7 provide brief lists of the variety of datable
manufactured items which often appear in archeological deposits.
Various kinds of trade items, such as beads, firearms, and cooking
pots, are not included in these tables but comprise a whole
category of material culture essential to interpreting contact
period sites.

The variety and volume of domestic material at European American
sites tends to increase through time, with relatively little found
at 17th-century sites and more at 19th and 20th century sites.
Even wealthy settlers in the early years of the colonies did not
leave dense archeological deposits. The consumer revolution of the
18th century (e.g., McKendrick et al. 1982) drastically changed the
material world of the middle class and this transformation is
clearly visible archeologically. Consumer choice and the
relationship of consumer purchasing and discard to class and
ethnicity (e.g., Spencer-Wood 1987) and gender (e.g., Wall 1994)
are some of the most compelling archeological issues for the late
18th through early 20th centuries.

The questions which may be asked of consumer choice are broad and
apply not only to European ethnic groups but also to Native

Americans and African Americans. Issues of consumption are linked
to consumer characteristics -- such as purchasing power,
occupation, status, class, race, and gender -- and to external

factors such as transportation networks, marketplace availability,
labor-management relations, and price- fixing.

There is a large archeological literature on plantations and
plantation-based slavery (see, for example, Singleton 1985, Orser
1990). Slaves' resistance to enslavement and creation of a
sustainable culture under that condition are found to occasionally
leave evidence in the archeological record (e.g., Epperson 1990;
Ferguson 1992).

One of the most compelling historical questions which has yet to be
adequately investigated through archeology in the mid-Atlantic is
the changing relationships among European, African, and Native
Americans. One of the material culture keys to begin asking
archeological questions of these relationships is so-called colono-
ware, an American-made ceramic which may have been made by Native
Americans, enslaved African Americans, or both.

II. OVERVIEW: CHRONOLOGY /HISTORIC 111


=== Page 142 ===

Leland Ferguson (1992) has strong evidence to tie much of the
colono-ware in the Carolinas to West African traditions maintained
by slaves. Deetz (1988) and Matthew Emerson (1994) have suggested
that colono-ware and pipes in the mid-Atlantic were also made by
slaves. Other researchers, however, have demonstrated connections
to Native American makers (Stephen Potter, personal communication).

The manufacture, trade, sale, and use of this category of ceramic

present some of the most interesting archeological research
questions in the historic period mid-Atlantic.

ECONOMY

Archeologists typically consider subsistence when attempting to
reconstruct past lifeways. Subsistence could be broadly conceived
as encompassing all the ways people interact with the environment
in order to make a living; that is, it could be seen as economy.
However, it is more usually seen simply as diet, a situation which
causes concern for many archeologists.

Economy encompasses production, consumption, distribution, and
exchange of goods that sustain or reproduce human livelihood.
Therefore, as a topic economy covers much more than subsistence
and, once identified, it is nearly impossible to narrow to a
manageable breadth. Just as it is difficult to discuss diet alone
without discussing ecology and settlement patterns, it is difficult
to consider economy without social organization, division of labor,
and complexity as well as diet and the ecological setting. Therein
lies the advantage to an approach that targets economy rather than
simply subsistence: it forces us to ask anthropological, cultural
questions of the evidence of past societies.

For these reasons economy is offered as the rubric under which
subsistence, uses of the landscapes, and human interaction
function.

Much work remains to be done within economic archeology. Barry
Isaac (1990:332) emphasizes that serious attention to the cultural
component in general and the economic in particular is largely
missing from the study of prehistoric subsistence. He adopts Rhoda
Halperin's (1989) distinction between ecological and economic
anthropology wherein the former is largely concerned with
locational movements and rearrangements of settlements on the
landscape while the latter is concerned with more socially
encompassing arrangements for how people appropriate and distribute
resources and labor. Both the ecological and the economic need to
be interrelated in order to encompass the sociocultural dimension
of human livelihood.

Isaac is concerned about archeologists confounding ecology and
economy. During the 1970s and 1980s archeologists were influenced
greatly by optimal foraging models. He (1990:332) writes,
these models impel us to think in terms of behavior - not
culture or that institutional component we think of as economy
- and, despite their inclusion of food processing as well as
food production, those models again incline us to think in
terms of locational movements and caloric input-output.

He warns against the tendency to equate subsistence with food with

economy because doing so omits much of what is interesting about
human behavior from archeological analysis and interpretation. One

II. OVERVIEW: ECONOMY 113


=== Page 144 ===

of the major issues identified by Tankersley and Isaac is the
limitation of the ecological paradigm that has dominated for the
past fifty years and the accompanying need for an economic
framework to balance out the study of prehistoric livelihood
(Tankersley and Isaac 1990c:345-6):
Succinctly put, the crux of the matter is this:
behavioral/cultural analysis - of which economic analysis is
an important part - requires a very different existential
referent than ecological analysis requires.

An ecological analysis requires ecological analogies and hence
expends a great deal of energy on paleoenvironmental
reconstruction. Behavioral/cultural analysis requires ethnographic
analogy. Archeology cannot have a science of prehistoric human
behavior or culture without sophisticated procedures for evaluating
and using ethnographic analogy or ethnographic models (Tankersley
and Isaac 1990c:346). This point has been made above in discussing
analogy in archeological logic. Environmental parameters, of
course, must be considered as well.

In reflecting on the results of decades of subsistence analysis,
Brown (1986) argues for the need to place subsistence information
into a broader context of mobility and organizational strategies.

Michael Shott (1990) objects that if something approaching behavior
and social organization is identified as a major focus for
Paleoindian research, it is expressed and addressed as subsistence.
He (1990:7) is unhappy with a diet-centered model: "Without a broad
frame of reference, the discovery of subsistence remains does no
more than add entrees to the Paleoindian menu." He urges
archeologists to focus instead on structural properties that
produce variability even in stable environmental and economic
conditions. We should expect flexibility, resourcefulness and
opportunism as systematic variability within hunter-gatherer
societies.

In his objection that the social context of primitive economies is
ignored in eastern Paleoindian studies, Shott touches upon a common
problem in much of prehistory. Economic strategies depend not only
on environmental factors but also on social properties such as
information gathering, goals, and decision making rules. Shott
argues that in focusing on diet "archaeology surrenders its unique
anthropological potential of documenting cultural organizations not
represented in the ethnographic record" (1990:10).

In a similar vein, William Keegan expresses his goal for examining
the development of horticulture. He writes (1987:xv),
The purpose , . . is to go beyond the current emphasis on the
origins and diffusion of plant domestication to address the
socioeconomic conditions that promoted the intensification of

II. OVERVIEW: ECONOMY 114


=== Page 145 ===

horticultural production and the sociocultural consequences of
such increased reliance on cultigens.

The following discussions serve as an introduction to some of the
issues in economic archeology.

Subsistence

To understand human adaptation, the available environment must be
understood. What is available depends upon 1) the physical
surroundings, including climate, geology, and topography; 2)
technologies for extraction, processing and storage; and 3) the
social organization of labor and strategies for interaction within
and between groups. The nature of subsistence resources depends on
age, sex, seasonal growth, population cycles, and behavior of
floral and faunal species.

Emphasizing one of Marshall Sahlins' points about’ social
production, Kenneth Sassaman (1992:71) writes, "technology
constitutes a labor process for appropriating nature that is
inherently social." Social relations of production guide the way
in which surpluses are created and appropriated through exchange or
other means.

Many changes are expected to occur with subsistence innovations.
Some of the following are certainly more pronounced with the
establishment of food production, but any major reorganization in
economy will have far-reaching effects. Changes will occur in 1)
demography, 2) settlement organization and degree of mobility, 3)
physical environment, 4) technological innovations, 5) social
organization, including labor organization, 6) conflicts and
competition, 7) markets, trade and exchange, 8) diet, 9) ecology,
and 10) human biology including health and disease.

Hunter-Gatherer Subsistence. Testart (1982) distinguishes two
radically different hunter-gatherer economies. One, characterized
by flexibility, emphasizes multiple alternative strategies and
immediate use of resources. The other relies on large-scale
seasonal food storage. He rightly points out that for hunter-
gatherers to sustain a storage economy, they need both one or more
seasonally abundant resources and the technical ability to gather,
process and store those resources so that they are available year-
round. He suggests that because of the seasonal variation in food-
gathering there would be seasonal variation in leisure and
ceremonial time as well and that some rigidity in planning would be
essential. He also expects 1) a high degree of sedentism, since
mobility would be neither possible nor necessary; 2) high
population density; and 3) socioeconomic inequality. The latter is
largely due to the fact that stored food is a very different

II. OVERVIEW: ECONOMY 115


=== Page 146 ===

commodity than food which must be used quickly before spoilage.
Changes are expected in the nature of ownership, the morality of
sharing and accumulation, the division of labor and the degree of
interpersonal exploitation possible. It is the opinion of Testart
that storage rather than agriculture marks the turning point in
human history. Some of the recent work on the variable complexity
of hunter-gatherers, discussed above in the section = on
archeological logic, would support the idea that there are several
different kinds of economies among societies which forage for their
food rather than producing it.

An increasing amount of evidence in the mid-Atlantic supports the
idea that Paleoindian people were generalized foragers. It now
seems evident that in the eastern United States the earliest
inhabitants did not rely on the hunting of megafauna to supply
their needs.

Food remains were found at the Shawnee-Minisink site in the
Delaware Valley in a hearth dated to 8,640+300 BCE. Fish bones
were found along with hawthorne plum pits, hackberry, blackberry,
grape, Chenopodium, Acalypha, Amaranth, Physalis, ragweed, and
sedge (Dent and Kaufman 1985).

Ebright (1992:410) reports hickory phytoliths on Clovis point
fragments and turkey feather fibers from a feature in the
Paleoindian component of the Higgins site in Anne Arundel County,
Maryland. These findings “bolster the concept of a much broader
Paleoindian resource base for the Middle Atlantic area than one
focused solely on large game animals occupying a boreal forest
environment."

Based on a limited sample of skeletal remains, Gentry Steele and
Joseph Powell (1994) suggest that Paleoindian diet was generalized
and similar to later Archaic people. They base their conclusion on
dental microwear analysis (1994:189).
Three types of microscopic enamel damage have been noted in
the Paleoindian sample: pitting, striations, and polish.
Pitting, or "compression fracturing," of enamel occurs when
hard materials are processed in the mouth. Striations are
associated with grit introduced either through a coarse diet,
accidental food contamination, or the use of stone grinding
implements, . . . Enamel polishing, and the smoothing of
margins in striations and pits, is associated with the
consumption of dietary fiber.

While a long-held interpretation states that the beginning of the
Archaic is represented by a shift away from the very specialized
big-game focus of the Clovis hunter, a re-examination of Clovis
people demands that this characterization of subsequent periods be
revised.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 116


=== Page 147 ===

As seasonality became more of a factor in resource availability,
the complications of scheduling movements and labor increased.
Patchiness of the environment both spatially and temporally
probably increased. There may have been a decline in quarry-based
settlement (in areas where such a focus occurred) because other
resources became more patchy and difficult to schedule.

There is very little direct evidence for subsistence in the Early
Archaic, especially of floral material, but there is some. Models
of subsistence are based on inferred environmental settings of
sites. Current understandings emphasize the importance of faunal
food, but there has been little research into the archeological
remains of plant food from this period.

A general picture of plant and animal food used during the Early
Archaic is drawn from several sites throughout the eastern United
States, although not from the mid-Atlantic. David Meltzer and
Bruce Smith (1986:17) list the following species from archeological
contexts:

Plants: oak acorn, hickory nut, black walnut, hackberry seeds,
persimmon seed;

Mollusk: freshwater mollusk;

Fish: sucker, gar;

Reptile: box turtle;

Bird: turkey, trumpeter swan; and

Mammal: mole, voles, rodents, beaver, cottontail, squirrel,
muskrat, raccoon, coyote/dog, elk, and deer.

The general picture of subsistence in the Early and Middle Archaic
is of generalized foraging during warm seasons when food was more
or less evenly distributed across landscape. This strategy shifted
to one of collecting (sensu Binford 1980) in cooler months when elk
and deer could be the focus of group hunts. Freshwater fish and
mollusks along interior drainages of the eastern United States were
exploited but marine or estuarine foods were not (Whyte 1990).

For most of the Middle Archaic period, reliance on deer, turkey,
waterfowl, and anadromous fish is assumed. A broader resource base
than pre-bifurcate emphasis on hunting is indicated by in the
greater variety of toolkits (Stewart and Cavallo 1991:23).

Discussing the Shell Mound Archaic in western Kentucky, William
Marquardt and Patty Jo Watson (1983) generalize about broad based

subsistence. Archaic people fished, hunted, grew gourd-like
squashes, and collected mussels, hickory nuts, and other riverine
foods. At some sites hickory nuts are recovered in vast

quantities. Marquardt and Watson indicate that the nuts themselves
could be pounded and thrown into hot water to make hickory nut
butter and the nutshells could be used as fuel.

Although there is very little floral evidence collected or
interpreted from prehistoric sites in the Potomac basin,
ecological reconstructions make it clear that nut-bearing trees
were available early. Hickory, oak, and chestnut were the primary
sources. Thomas Jackson's (1991) discussion of acorn production in
the southern Sierra Nevada offers an analogy that may be applicable
to some time periods in mid-Atlantic prehistory. Acorns were
important because they were abundant and storable; in this they
were similar to cultigens. All family members collected acorns but
women were responsible for processing, storage, and distribution.
Equipment included baskets, brushes, mortars, and pestles. Mortars
created in bedrock are clearly immobile features. Milling stations
were segregated in large winter villages and integrated in smaller
summer camps. Fixed production facilities were created,
particularly along deer migration routes.

Charles LeeDecker et al. (1991) discuss some of the evidence for
subsistence and material culture during the late Early Archaic
(bifurcate base points) and the Late Archaic at the Indian Creek V
site near the Fall Line in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Very
good plant preservation and careful analysis revealed an important
botanical assemblage. Discovered were fruits, tubers, starchy
seeds, nuts, shoots and leaves with seasonal availability in the
spring, summer and fall. Tubers represented over 80% of the taxa,
while there were very few nuts. The authors believe that nuts are
probably over-represented and over-interpreted in most
archeological contexts. Nearly all of the 37 charred plant species
have documented ethnographic uses. Such plants were used to
medicate and intoxicate, and for cordage, mats, baskets, decorative
objects, dyes, and shelter.

Describing coastal adaptations between the Late Archaic and the
Middle Woodland (3000 BCE-1000CE), Custer (1988:125) writes, "In
general, this shift can be characterized as an emphasis on the rich
and predictable resources of the major river valley floodplains and
the estuarine marsh settings."

Shell middens appeared worldwide during the Holocene; in the
Americas most formed after about 5000 years ago. Shell middens are
unusual archeological features because they are much more visible
than most short term sites which would be formed for the periodic
exploitation of any particular resource.

Because this shift is central to subsistence strategies and other
related changed from the Late Archaic on, Gregory Waselkov's
(1982) observations on shellfish collecting are noted at length as
follows.

Waselkov's (1982) research goals concerning shellfish gathering may

be applied to the study of any particular part of the subsistence
system. These goals are to determine:

II, OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 118


=== Page 149 ===

1. the role of shellfish gathering in relation to the total
seasonal subsistence round;

2. the significance of shellfish gathering to overall settlement-
subsistence; and

3. the relationships of shellfish gathering strategies to changes
in other areas of subsistence and changes in social organization
and the development of chiefdoms.

Gleaning information from ethnographic writings, Waselkov notes
that shellfish procurement is usually done by hand from exposed
rocks and shallow wading by both women and women with children.
English observers noted Powhatan boys diving for freshwater
mussels. Ethnohistoric sources also note preparation methods for
the Maryland and North Carolina Algonquians, the Virginia
Powhatans, the Delaware, and European colonists in Philadelphia.
According to these sources, shellfish could be opened by cracking
or perforating the shell or by using a shucking knife. Cooking
methods for shellfish included roasting, baking, steaming, and
boiling. Shellfish meat was either dried or smoked prior to
storage or trade. Archeological evidence for preparation is sought
in cooking pits and other features (Waselkov 1982),

Seasonal use of shellfish depends not only on availability but also
on peoples' assessment of all food resources, needs, costs and
other expectations and perceptions. Among the Maryland Algonquians
fall and winter were shelifish gathering seasons; among the
Virginia Powhatan it was winter, late spring, and early summer
(Waselkov 1982:38).

Six main conclusions offered about shellfish use at the White Oak
Point site and surrounding area are as follows (Waselkov 1982).

i the White Oak Point site was occupied in Spring by small
groups in temporary oystering camps from the Late Archaic
through the early Historic;

2% Most meat was obtained from oysters but there was also
clam digging, crabbing, fishing, deer hunting, and the
gathering and processing of acorns and hickory nuts;

3. techniques of hunting and gathering changed little if at
all;

4. in the Late Archaic shellfish other than oyster
contributed a larger percentage of meat than at any later
time;

5. the average number of oysters per volume of midden
increased after the Late Archaic;

6. beginning in the early Late Woodland, there were a number
of important changes: species diversity dropped; roasting
basins were first used; mammals and fish contributed
larger proportions of available meat; and the average
number of oysters per volume sharply increased.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 119


=== Page 150 ===

The latter conclusion in particular gives rise to the following
scenario. There is a large scale drying of oyster meat for storage
and trade and a larger number of mammals and fish compensates for
the loss of immediately consumable oysters. The shift could be in
response to agricultural demands and the need for spring planting.
The increased specialization and production of storable commodities
by some individuals or group segments would have freed others for
different tasks (Waselkov 1982).

Waselkov discusses interrelationships between shellfish gathering,
population growth, and the origins of agriculture. In several
places around the world, the earliest evidence for plant
domesticates is found either at shell middens or at non-shell sites
occupied by seasonal shellfish gatherers who are doing other
things. When domesticated plants began to play a significant role
in the diet, the use of shellfish declined rapidly (Waselkov
1982:115). For example, in the riverine shell middens of eastern
North America, squash remains date as early as 4,400 BP and
sunflower and sumpweed appear to be domesticated by 2,900-2,400 BP.
Both the plants and the river mussels would have supplied high
protein and presumably only one type of resource would have been
necessary.

Cheryl Claassen (1991) explores questions of gender and labor
scheduling for shellfish gathering during the Shell Mound Archaic.
Some of her hypotheses fit neatly with Waselkov's observations.
Joining critics of cultural ecology, Claassen cites Barbara Bender,
who characterizes much archeology as having "rejected both specific
history and principles of social structure in favor of an assumed
ecological common denominator." Women are almost universally
recorded as shellfish collectors in the ethnographic record. It is
not necessarily the case that women were shellfish collectors in
the unrecorded past, but Claassen uses this as a hypothesis to help
create more complete models of past social and labor organization
by including considerations of gender division of labor.

Claassen explores ideas about the organization of women's labor and
questions how women accommodated shellfishing in the eastern United
States when it appeared about 8,000-9,000 BP and why the Shell
Mound Archaic peoples stopped shellfishing about 5,500-3,000 BP.
This early shellfishing activity took place in Tennessee, Kentucky
and West Virginia. The Shell Mound Archaic is identified by the
mounding of shells, the use of mounded shells for burials, and the
lack of evidence of permanent housing. Hypotheses for the
cessation of mussel collecting have included the overexploitation
of the mussel population, environmental change, and human migration
outside the area. Claassen raises the possibility that a radical
change in women's labor necessitated the abandonment of
shellfishing. Such an abundant food source would not be abandoned
unless there was something to replace it. Claassen argues that
competition for time needed for harvesting crops changed the

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 120



=== Page 151 ===

economic organization as cultivated food came to be substituted for
much of the diet.

It would be useful to add Claassen's hypothesis to Waselkov's
synthesis of this subsistence focus in the Potomac basin, where
shellfish collecting is documented much later, after 3000 BP, and
continues from the Late Archaic into historic times.

Food Production. Barbara Bender (1978:206) emphasizes social
structure and, in the context of developing food production, asks
how developing social relations promote economic’ change.
Addressing the development of food-producing economies out of
hunting-gathering ones is “about increased preduction and about why
increased demands are made on the economy."

She is unsatisfied with technoenvironmental explanations that
ignore internal dynamics of a society. Within a hunter-gatherer
economy, households, however they are constructed, are responsible
for basic production within a larger system of social support and
demands. Alliances embedded within kinship systems provide the
social rules and terms that constrain actions. Alliance systems
may be more or less complex and make greater or lesser demands on
production. Even within impoverished hunter-gatherer social systems
that survive ethnographically, there are marriage alliances and
ceremonial exchange and trade. Further ethnographic detail offers
four observations concerning the variable social structure of
hunting-gathering societies:

1. individual bands are integrated into wider social networks;

2. different alliance networks are important in binding various
groups together;

3. demands may be generated over and above subsistence requirements
of individual bands; and

4. demand varies according to the type of alliance and exchange.

Sedentism escalates demand for increasing production as it
encourages storage, accumulation, control of labor, and control of
land. Archeologists need to attempt to delineate how demands were
generated rather than simply how they were met. Trade and
exchange, ceremonial undertakings, and status differentiation are
some of the archeologically-visible particulars that shed light on
changes in economic organization (Bender 1978).

Although it is premature to judge plant domestication during the
Early Woodland in the mid-Atlantic, certainly there is intensive
harvesting of wild seeds evidenced by the considerable numbers of
grinding stones on Savannah River (Late Archaic) and Early Woodland
sites in the James Valley (Mouer 1991b). Discussions of early
gardening focus on data in the midwest (Smith 1992); there are only
a few contexts in the mid-Atlantic region with possibly
domesticated seeds dating to Transitional/Early Woodland.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 121


=== Page 152 ===

Parallels may be drawn between the conditions which gave rise to
domestication in the Midwest and transitional/Early Woodland
conditions in the mid-Atlantic. The clearance of floodplain forests
and disturbance and enrichment of soils around camps were some
factors contributing to domestication (Smith 1992). In the mid-
Atlantic the appearance of anadromous fishing camps during the Late
Archaic initiated the process of floodplain clearing along interior
streams (Mouer 1991b). Comparisons between the regions' relative
reliance on domesticated and collected food would offer interesting
insights into economic strategies.

J. Sanderson Stevens (1991:200) argues that the subsistence
strategies of both Late Archaic and Early Woodland people were
focused on a few resources. They gathered shellfish and anadromous
fish and intensely harvested plant resources. Major faunal species
used include deer, black bear, turkey, squirrel, rabbit and other
small mammals, turtles, fish, water fowl, beaver, otter, and
muskrat. The social relations of production developed with these
new strategies may have been more complex than those of earlier
groups.

Species available during the Woodland period generally may be
assumed to be those in use at contact. The seasonal round of foods
used by Potomac area Algonquians at time of initiation of sustained
European contact is synthesized by Stephen Potter (1993:40-43) and
is presented schematically in Table II.9, above.

Subsistence during Late Woodland Il among the Virginia Algonquians
was based on the swidden farming of maize. Beans, squash, pumpkins,
gourds, sunflower and tobacco were also grown (Potter 1993:33).
Corn contributed over half of the diet and was consumed by at least
part of the population throughout the year (Potter 1993:40). Maize
is found throughout the mid-Atlantic by 900/1000 CE and becomes
intensively used by 1200/1300 CE (Stewart 1993).

At the Paw Paw site on the Allegheny Plateau carbonized corn
kernels, seeds, nut shells, and remains of various indigenous

plants were found. Knotweed (Polygonum) and goosefoot
(Chenopodium) are disturbed zone plants cultivated in the eastern
Woodlands. Sumac (Rhus) is a multipurpose plant’ used

ethnographically for food, beverage, and medicine and its leaves
can be smoked. Dock (Rumex) and copperleaf (Acalypha) were also
found (Curry 1983:38ff).

Table II.10 provides radiocarbon dates from sites containing plant

domesticates from the Potomac and James River basins and adjacent

Development of Agriculture in the Eastern United States. It is
relatively recently that Eastern North America could be said to
possess one of the most detailed records of the development of
agriculture. This record is due, in part, to the use of new
technologies: flotation to recover plant remains, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), radiocarbon dating of small samples with
accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS), and stable carbon isotope
analysis of human bone (Smith 1989). Classic archeological models
to explain agriculture (e.g., Braidwood 1960) often assumed speedy
and wholesale adoption after its "invention" and therefore
archeologists often focused on tracking down the origins -- the
oldest corn cob, for example -- so as to pinpoint the time and
place in which evolution progressed. More research and careful
thinking about the process have made it clear that the development
of food production, as Smith (1989) points out in his synthesis of
eastern North America, was a longer and far more complex process
than once thought.

Bruce Smith's (1989, 1992) syntheses of data for plant cultivation
in the Eastern United States differ somewhat in detail and
interpretation, indicating that research of the topic is extremely

active. It is important to note that much of his discussion
concerns the mid-latitude area stretching from the Appalachians
west to the prairie margin. The eastern Coastal Plain and

Piedmont, therefore, are outside the zone where there is evidence
for indigenous agriculture. Much further work remains to be done
in the Chesapeake region.

Indications of agricultural development include direct
representation of crop seeds and pollen and remains in human
coprolites; hoes; pollen and macrobotanical indications of field
clearing; storage vessels and features for seeds; processing and
cooking technology (Smith 1992).

Smith's (1992) six periods of agricultural development are
summarized here to provided a baseline for questions outside the
zone of agricultural development.

I. Early and Middle Holocene foragers prior to 7,000 BP (5,050
BCE).

People used the broad resources of the forest, including acorns and
hickory nuts, and the forest edges, including seeds and berries.
There is no human intervention in the life cycle of plants except
for the fortuitous disturbance of soils in campsites.

II. Middle Holocene collectors, 7,000 to 4,000 BP (5,050-2050 BCE).
A change in stream flow changed the floodplains and resource
distribution. Occupations changed to shell mound and midden mound
settlements with continuous ground disturbance. Weedy invaders
into disturbed zones included cucurbita, goosefoot, sumpweed, and
sunflower, which would have provided supplementary food sources.

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 125


=== Page 156 ===

A transition in human intervention "from simple toleration to
inadvertent, and then active encouragement...was critical in the
co-evolutionary trajectory leading to domestication" (Smith
1992:283). Then “planting, even on a very small scale,...marks
both the beginning of cultivation and the onset of automatic
selection" (Smith 1992:282). Smith also notes, however, that
sunflower was not indigenous to the region (1992:283). During this
period there is also a dramatic increase in hickory nuts after
7,500 BP which may indicate new nut-processing technologies such as
hide-lined and rock-heated boiling pits for separating hulls from
meat and the active management of hickory trees to increase yields
(Smith 1992:287).

III. The initial domestication of eastern seed plants, 4,000 to
3,000 BP (2,050-1,050 BCE).
By this time there was distinctive morphological change in the four
weedy species of cucurbita, goosefoot, sumpweed, and sunflower.
However, Smith (1992:288) writes,
there is little evidence that this process of domestication
occurred within a framework of deliberate human selection, or
that these domesticated plant species contributed
substantially to the diet of fourth millennium B.P.
populations.

IV. The Development of Farming Economies 3,000 to 1,700 BP (1050
BCE to 250 CE).

Storage contexts recorded for this period include grass-lined pits,
woven bags, and gourd containers. Processing equipment includes
wooden mortars, stone slabs, and mortar holes in stone slabs. There
are also chert hoes, indications of land clearing, and changes in
settlement patterns. The dietary importance of indigenous
cultigens increased greatly during this period and there was a
concomitant dramatic cultural change.

V. The Expansion of Field Agriculture 1,700 to 800 BP (250-1150
CE).

This period could be divided into two subperiods based on the rapid
adoption of maize and technical innovations associated with it
around 800 CE. The period 200-800 CE is marked by a growing
importance of plant husbandry and the addition of the tropical
cultigens of maize and tobacco as well as population growth and
dispersal. After 800 there are a number of innovations: exchange
of large, well-made chert hoes; elaboration and improvement of
ceramic vessels; and increase in storage pit size. Between 800-
1150 Mississippian chiefdom societies emerged. It is also during
this latter part of the period when areas outside the domestication
zone shift to maize agriculture (Smith 1989).

VI. Maize-Centered Field Agriculture after 800 BP (1150 CE).

Stable carbon isotope analysis indicates that maize was not a
staple food until after 1,100. It is important to note that there

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 126


=== Page 157 ===

is a great deal of variability in reliance on maize and in the
varieties of maize grown. A low variability, 8-row maize was grown
after 1100 in the Ohio Valley, Northeast and upper Midwest but in
other areas there was considerably more variety in the maize itself
(Smith 1992:293), possibly because there were more frequent
arrivals of new varieties into the southeast from the Southwest,
Mexico, or the Caribbean (Smith 1992:294).

Smith calls on archeologists to pay more attention to the different
varieties of maize grown in the east and to improve the level of
analysis in order to address some of the developmental issues. Many
indigenous plants continued to be cultivated after maize was
adopted. Smith lists sumpweed, sunflower, knotweed, varieties of
chenopod, maygrass and little barley, Jerusalem artichoke, maypops,
amaranth, purslane, pokeweed, ragweed, chenopod and carpetweed
(1989:295). He notes that there is no reason to expect that
indigenous crops were grown only at a garden scale while maize was
grown for larger yields. Especially prior to 1000 CE the pre-maize
crops were probably grown for large harvests (1989:295-6).

Some researchers have suggested that the early introduction of 8~
rowed Northern flint corn came through the Caribbean into eastern
North America. A later infusion of another variety of maize, the
12 to 16-rowed Midwestern 12, came east from the American Southwest
or the Gulf Coast. Maize was present for several centuries before
it became a staple. It has been suggested that maize agriculture
supported the use of green corn early, from the end of the Archaic.
One indirect piece of evidence offered is the near universal term
for maize in Central and Eastern Algonkian languages, indicating
that the crop was known before the language branches split around
1000 BCE (Riley et al. 1990). Such evidence has not been confirmed
with archeological discoveries.

Patty Jo Watson and Mary Kennedy (1991) discuss the process of
developing horticulture with a view that explicitly incorporates
gender. They assume a male/female division of labor and formalize
it for the eastern woodlands using archeological, ethnohistoric,
and ethnographic information. They take exception to
reconstructions that implicate women as passive and non-innovative,
criticizing both Smith's (1987) coevolutionary framework for weedy
plant domestication and Guy Prentice's (1986) proposition that male
shamans were responsible for gourd domestication.

Their conclusions in questioning the automatic characterization of
plant domestication and the coevolutionary formulation are as
follows.

1) Sunflower and maygrass were grown outside their natural ranges
by 3000-2500 BP. Therefore, their cultivation must have been
purposeful. Smith (1992) places non-indigenous cultivation of
sunflower even earlier, during his period II, 7000-4000 BP.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 127


=== Page 158 ===

2) The best dietary evidence for the eastern woodlands from fecal
matter dating 2800-2500 BP in Salts Cave and Mammoth Cave indicates
that over 60% of the plant food consumed was of indigenous
cultigens: sunflower, sumpweed, and chenopod. Clearly the addition
of domesticated species had more than a slight dietary impact.

3) Women collectors and gardeners around 3500-2500 BP devised and
used techniques of tilling, harvesting, and processing and applied
them to maize production. The significant difference in maize
related tools and techniques in the East as opposed to that in the
Southwest and Mexico suggests that eastern maize was adopted into
a preexisting pattern.

4) Most generally, the great botanical knowledge of hunter-gatherer
people and women's extensive knowledge of using plants makes the
image of unintended and automatic plant domestication untenable.

Our understanding of the sequence of agricultural development in
the eastern United States has improved dramatically due to both
better collection and analytic methods and more innovative
questions. Clearly, much analysis and interpretation remains to be
done, especially in the context of an economic archeology which may
begin to address division of labor and the social consequences and
motivators for technical and dietary changes.

Plantations and Industry. The tobacco economy characterized 17th-
and early 18th-century European settlement in the Potomac Basin.
There was also some early vital industrial development, such as
iron furnaces during the 18th century. The place of the English
colonies within the world economic system was that of an economic
periphery servicing the British economic core. Throughout the 18th
and 19th centuries, plantations and farms remained vital to
regional and local economies. Market economies developed their own
cores within the colonies and early Republic. Various crafts,
manufacturing, and trade continued to expand. Since the late 19th
century the service industry of the federal government has become
one of the most powerful economic factors in the area.

It would be well beyond the scope of this overview to attempt to
summarize historic period diet, agricultural strategies, crafts,
manufacturing, and business. Some of this type of information in
included in the discussion of uses of the landscape rather than
here under subsistence. Some brief comments on subsistence will
serve as examples of the sorts of information which archeology can
contribute to understanding historic lifeways.

Discussing the colonization gradient in relation to the 17th-
century Chesapeake, Henry Miller (1984) hypothesizes that
subsistence practices in colonies will tend to be less complex and
specialized than those in the homeland. That is, colonial settlers

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 128


=== Page 159 ===

will use a wider range of resources than at home. As population
increases there will be more emphasis on dependable resources which
can be intensively exploited. Subsistence should become more
stable and complex through time and, initially, be similar
throughout socioeconomic levels. As opportunities decline and the
social system becomes more rigid, there should be increasing
differentiation in subsistence strategies and diet between classes.

Fish make up 34% of the faunal remains on 17th-century sites in the
Chesapeake region. Remains of oysters and blue crab are found at
most sites and are abundant at many of them. Oysters don't show
signs of overharvesting in rural areas but do in the urban setting
of St. Mary's City, where overharvesting reduced oyster sizes as
human population increased (Miller 1986:181).

By the end of the 17th century Chesapeake colonists were focusing
on cattle and pigs for their meat. Miller (1984:382) writes,
in addition to meat, dairy products, and cooking fats, cattle
and swine also provided a secondary source of income, a buffer
against economic difficulty, and a means of improving the
lives of one's children through inheritance.
Faunal data from Harmony Hall, located on the late 17th-century
western frontier of Maryland in Prince Georges County, supports
Miller's thesis (Sonderman et al. 1993).

After 1700 domestic animals account for over 90% of the meat
remains on rural sites. Fish were still used but were far less
important. Nets were used more often than previously, but the hook
and line were still the primary fishing equipment. Commercial
fishing of herring and shad began in the 1760s (Miller 1986:182;
Middleton 1953). Oysters began to be harvested by tongs in the
early 18th century, permitting harvesting of beds in deeper waters
(Miller 1986:182).

Food remains provide insight into site inhabitants' participation
in the economic system. For example, the cuts of meat used may
demonstrate self-sufficiency (the butchering and use of whole
animals), production for the market (retention and discard of
certain parts), or buying meats from the market (limited parts).

Several historical archeologists have suggested that status may be
investigated through faunal analysis, with relative wealth
indicated by species, cut of meat, and method of preparation. Some
have suggested that during the 17th century, the presence of deer
in European households may indicated wealth and leisure (e.g.,
Miller 1986; Reitz 1987; see Manning-Sterling and Atkins 1995).
This suggestion is based on the English hunting tradition, access
of the colonial land-owning class to more land, and the documented
hiring of Native Americans to hunt for wealthier households.
Investigation of 17th-century Virginia faunal assemblages, however,
conclude that there is no clear-cut distinction between wealthy and

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/SUBSISTENCE 129


=== Page 160 ===

poor inhabitants based on the presence of deer (Manning-Sterling
and Atkins 1995).

Faunal analysis of 18th-century urban contexts has been carried out
at some sites in Annapolis, Maryland (e.g., Reitz 1989). Just under
half of the early 18th-century meat of the wealthy Calvert family
of Annapolis was made up of cattle, pig, and either sheep or goat.
Much of the remainder was fish and fowl (Yentsch 1994:222).

Resources of the Chesapeake Bay were abundant until overharvesting
and pollution affected them. John James Audubon wrote in 1840 (in

Cronin 1986:196):

The Chesapeake Bay with its tributary streams, has from its
discovery, been known as the greatest resort of waterfowl in
the United States. This has depended upon the profusion of
their food, which is accessible on the immense flats or shoals
that are found near the mouth of the Susquehanna, along the
entire length of the North-East and Elk Rivers, and on the
shores of the bay and connecting streams as far south as York
and James Rivers.

Intensive harvesting so affected the bird population that
commercial wildfowl hunting was outlawed nationwide in 1919 (Cronin
1986:196).

Cronin (1986:193-194) documents the 19th-century overharvesting of
the oyster through the following series of events which greatly
affected the oyster population.

1828 - Baltimore and Ohio Railroad opened, improved
transportation

1836 - well established land transportation of fresh,
pickled and spiced oysters

1840 - discovery of vast, deep oyster beds in Tangier
Sound, available only by dredging

1845 - method perfected for hermetically sealing metal

cans, making feasible the canned and processed
oyster, or "cove"

1857 - 1,600,000 bushels of oysters handled in Baltimore
1865 - dredging legalized
1865 - 4,000,000 bushels of oysters handled in Baltimore

1868 - 10,000,000 bushels of oysters handled in Baltimore

1892/3 - over 900 dredges under license in Maryland

1898 - decline in the harvest begins and continues
drastically for next 20 years

For most of the 19th century blue crabs were consumed only locally.

The extension of the railroad to Crisfield, Maryland stimulated a
new industry in this resource as well (Cronin 1986:195).

In an urban 19th-century context, two assemblages from the first
half of the 19th century were analyzed from the Master Armorers
House in Harpers Ferry. About 1830 there occurred a decreased
dependence on home-raised pigs and an increased dependence on beef
bought in the marketplace. This change is tied to the arrival of
the canal and railroad and on a more urban, market-oriented way of
life (Shackel 1994b).

Plantation diet has also been studied for the 19th century (McKee
1988) and earlier (Crader 1984, 1990). Some aspects of the diet of
Slaves at Monticello have been explored through the examination of
faunal remains.

Diana Crader (1984) compared the faunal remains of two features at
Monticello: the Storehouse, a suspected slave dwelling, and the Dry
Well, which served the main house. The differences reflect the
status of the occupants. Crader (1984:556) writes:
Occupants of the Storehouse (presumably slaves) primarily ate
less meaty cuts, which may have been prepared as stews.
Mutton was rarely eaten by slaves, but an occasional rabbit,
opossum, squirrel, game bird, or chicken was prepared. The
bone refuse was discarded outside the dwelling where it was
subjected to a fair amount of trampling. Individuals in the
main house dined on hams, pork roasts, beef, mutton and lamb.
A variety of other meats may have been eaten including

squirrel, various birds, and fish. Bones were ultimately
discarded relatively intact as part of the fill for the Dry
Well. On interesting feature of both assemblages is the

absence of large, wild game such as deer.

However, even among slaves on the same plantation there were major
differences in diet. Faunal remains at another slave dwelling,
Building "o," at Monticello suggest a higher quality meat from that
of the Storehouse site. Questions are raised about relative slave
status and provisions, alternative reasons for the preservation of
discarded bone, and the formation of site deposits.

Because the broader economic, rather than subsistence context may
be constructed for the historic period, this discussion closes with
a brief description of the complexity of one location along the
Potomac.

Writing specifically of Georgetown, Janice Artemel et al.
(1987:125-126) identify several time period themes relevant to
changes on the waterfront. The definition of these periods is
quoted here in full.

a. Colonial Mercantilism and Maritime Trade (1608-1751). This
period includes that first European contact, the fur trade and
early colonial settlement, and the establishment of the town
as a stable, regionally recognized distribution center for the

It.

tobacco plantations, with an economic base in mercantilism and
maritime trade. The political base focused on the Colony and
Great Britain.

b. The Port of Georgetown and Maritime Development (1751-
1781). This period includes the formation and development of
the tobacco port, and the growth of the permanent settlement
through the Revolution. The economic base continued in
mercantilism and maritime trade, and the political base
remained with the Colony and Great Britain.

c. Federalism, Merchants, Industrialists and the Sea (1781-
1827). This period includes the formation of the federal
district within the new nation, prominence of the town and its
merchants, and the growth and decline of international
maritime trade. The economic base remained in trade, with
unprocessed goods including tobacco and grains, with
significant activity resulting from early industrial
development along the Potomac. The political base centered on
the new republic, the federal district and the Corporation of
Georgetown.

d. Industrial Growth and Maritime Trade (1828-1881). This
period begins with the use of the C&O Canal for transport of
grains from the hinterland to the port of Georgetown, and ends
with the transport of raw materials including coal, lime and
fertilizers used in industrial facilities and agricultural
centers, to the industrial centers of the nation. The economic
base and transportation network began to shift away from a
maritime focus. A diversified industrial economy and a rail
transport and distribution system developed and flourished.
The political base continued to focus on the developing nation
and the federal district.

e. Decline of a Waterfront: Industrial Maturation and Modern
Development, (1881-Present). This period encompassed the
development and maturation of an economy focused on industrial
products and their distribution with a corporate business
structure integrated into national spheres.

Use of the Landscape

Archeologists use the term settlement pattern to refer to the way
a population arranges itself on a landscape. The use of space,
including arrangements of settlements, and of features within
settlements, is responsive to the internal social and ideological
dynamics of a cultural group, its technology and economy, and the
distribution of resources and other characteristics of the natural
environment.

Some archeologists have begun to use landscape as a concept to
unify various approaches to spatial analysis. Carole Crumley and
William Marquardt (1990) describe landscape as the spatial
manifestation of relations between humans and their environment.
Landscapes are determined and defined by sociohistorical
structures, which are political, legal, and social; physical
structures, which are climatic, topographic, and geologic; and
their interpretations, which are aesthetic, symbolic, religious,
and ideological. Stephen Savage (1989) also uses landscape as a
concept with which to integrate interpretations of the social and
physical worlds in his study of Late Archaic landscapes.

Mobility and sedentism often have been correlated with simple
hunter-gatherers and more complex horticulturalists, respectively.
However, there is a great deal of flexibility and variety in human
settlement style. Sedentary agriculturalists, for example, send
out hunting and collecting parties and periodically move their
villages. Hunter-gatherers change their degree of mobility
according to seasonal resources and social needs for aggregation
and dispersal.

From ethnoarcheological studies, Binford (e.g., 1980) has observed
a great deal about hunter-gatherer strategies and mobility and the
way archeological patterning results. The scale of land-use among
hunter-gatherers is surprisingly large to people accustomed to
thinking about sedentary settlements, and Binford cautions us that
we have approached mobile groups with a sedentary frame of mind.
In his Alaskan (Nunamiut) case study the residential core area
through which a family moves in one year is 5,400 square
kilometers. The territory used during a lifetime is approximately
22,000 square kilometers. There are a great number of sites
generated by a mobile population, but there is also a great
variation in their use; some are used often and for different
purposes. A larger site, therefore, does not necessarily indicate
a large population but may indicate repeated use.

Mobility provides a means of security for hunter-gatherers.
Information directly gathered about the environment is of primary
value. Catastrophes can be dealt with by knowing what alternatives
are available. To become sedentary there must be a situation where
information about a broad area is no longer useful or the option of

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 133


=== Page 164 ===

moving into unoccupied territory is no longer realistic. Binford
(1983) describes the shift away from hunting-gathering to food
production as a shift from a system based on an "information bank"
to one based on a "labor bank."

Binford, and many others, see the prime mover in this shift as
population growth. Although there is no predictable rate of
growth, there is constant growth and with it the useable
environment fills up. This "packing" of the environment thwarts
extensive mobility as security. More kinds of resources get used
and developed with the need to stay longer in one place (Binford
1983). In developing and applying this model Binford and others
are primarily concerned with food and fuel resources. Clearly,
however, other raw materials are essential to human survival.
Suitable lithic resources, for example, will influence decisions
about mobility as will social considerations such as the matching
of suitable marriage partners.

Mobility patterning for hunter-gatherers depends upon their
placement on the forager-collector continuum. Foragers move
frequently and gather daily rather than store food. Only two
general types of sites are expected, although there may be very
little archaeological visibility at all. According to the model,
there should be residential base camps and locations or extractive
camps (for hunting, nut gathering, and other collecting tasks). At
the other end of the continuum, logistically-oriented collectors
move resources to themselves rather than move themselves to
resources as foragers do. They store food at least part of the
year. Collectors are expected to create more types of sites:
residential base camps; extractive camps; field camps, which are
temporary bases for task groups; stations, used for information-
gathering by task groups; and facilities, such as caches for food
storage, traps, or fish weirs (Binford 1980, 1982).

The strategy of any particular group may change seasonally as
resources become available. The pure forager moves in a continuous
pattern, spending little time in any base camp. The collector
moves base camps from point to point and then exploits a wide
radius of resources with logistical collecting parties who return
to the central camp. The types of sites expected to result from

different strategies may well overlap within a _ system. For
example, a collector's base camp may be used at other times of the
year as a transient camp or hunting camp. Archaeologically

identified sites, therefore, may be the result of considerable
layering of uses which are nearly impossible to distinguish.
Recurrent patterns of artifacts may have nothing to do with their
use together and instead result from the history of use of the site
(Binford 1980, 1982).

Binford (1980) has correlated mobility strategies with climate and
with the nature of resource availability. Foragers are fully

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 134


=== Page 165 ===

nomadic in equatorial and semi-tropical settings. Collectors are
semi-sedentary and sedentary in temperate and boreal settings.
Foraging works if all critical resources are within range of a base
camp. Residential moves are undertaken when an area's resources
are depleted. Residential moves won't help collectors because
moving closer to one critical resource moves the group farther from
some other equally critical resource. Storage helps to address
temporal incongruity in the environment, but stored caches of food
add to the spatial incongruity or patchiness of the environment
(Binford 1980, 1982).

Use of the Landscape in Prehistory. The earliest pre-Holocene
landscape on which people lived in the eastern United States
contained both glaciated and unglaciated sections. Much of the mid-
Atlantic region was unglaciated and offered a wider variety of
resources than glaciated regions. Meltzer and Smith (1986) argue
that such a landscape supported generalized hunter-gatherers.

There are other models, of course. Robert Kelly and Lawrence Todd
(1988) hypothesize about the initial strategies of people traveling
into a completely new environment. They refer to such people as
"technology oriented" because, in their model, the technology of
hunting for game is the method of getting food that is the most
quickly and easily translated from one ecological setting to
another. A summary of their scenario follows.

The environment 12,000 years ago in the eastern United States was
a patchwork boreal and deciduous forest with low seasonality and
with greater diversity of species, greater numbers of any given
species and larger individuals than any modern analog. People were
entering a rapidly changing environment. By 10,000 BP seasonality
was increasing, dozens of Pleistocene genera were extinct, and
latitudinally and elevationally segregated biotic zones were
appearing (Kelly and Todd 1988).

Paleoindians had to react to resource stress by switching
strategies with changes in resources or territories. Modern hunter-
gatherers rely on information, but where territories are nearly
completely unknown high mobility and transferable strategies are
expected. Because they are more understandable and harvesting
strategies are transferable, animals are hypothesized to be the
focus of subsistence. However, because the fauna are changing
rapidly, there should be high residential and logistical mobility
and range mobility. Kelly and Todd (1988) list four parts and some
implications of their model of early Paleoindians.
is New environments across the continent did not necessitate new
behaviors or tools since the adaptation was simply to
different prey size rather than species.
2. The landscape was used redundantly, with known places used
repeatedly. Paleoindians behaved as foragers, performing

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 135


=== Page 166 ===

largely similar functions at each site. Early quarry sites in
the east, for example, often contain a full range of tools,
while later ones do not.

= Technology had to be suited to a life of high mobility and be
transferable to unknown territories. Paleoindian assemblages
contain lots of bifaces of high quality stone which could
provide flakes and be repeatedly resharpened.

4. No storage is expected because stored food would restrict
mobility options.

There are no true modern analogies for the earliest Paleoindians.
Kelly and Todd (1988) characterize the adaptation as that of "high
technology foraging," incorporating elements of both foraging and
collecting. Foraging elements include high residential mobility,
variability in mobility based on local abundance of resources,
emphasis on search-and-encounter hunting tactics, and lack of
stored resources. Collecting elements include complex, curated
technology; repetitive use of style; high logistical mobility; and
large territories.

Anderson (1990) offers a model of the Paleoindian settlement of
eastern North America based on the same assumption that a
population is entering an empty social landscape about 12,000 BP.
Pronounced concentrations of fluted points are found in central
Tennessee, the Cumberland and Ohio River valleys, and along the
Atlantic seaboard in western South Carolina, southern Virginia, and
north-central North Carolina, New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
These concentrations are interpreted as "loci of initial
colonization, staging areas from which the settlement of the larger
region proceeded" (Anderson 1990:171).

Paleoindian adaptations were geographically extensive. The
population initially would have had to been highly mobile with
fairly sophisticated information exchange and mating networks
(Anderson 1990:181). The peopling of the Potomac Basin may have
taken place from earlier "staging areas" along major interior
waterways such as the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee drainages
(Anderson 1991a). As foraging bands made their way across the
continent they may have practiced "High Technology Foraging". As
particularly attractive, resource-rich areas were encountered,
groups stayed and began to focus their activities within these
particular places.

The focus on particular sources of lithic raw materials has been
considered crucial to Paleoindian adaptation. Several
archeologists (e.g., Gardner 1974a,b; Goodyear 1979) consider the
essential resource to be high quality cryptocrystalline rock.
Gardner (1977, 1989) suggests that such lithic resources provided
fixed points around which the rest of a groups' movements focused.
The largest Paleoindian base camps are quarry base camps such as
Thunderbird of the Flint Run Complex.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 136


=== Page 167 ===

Paleoindian hunters, their settlement pattern focused on quarry
locations, may not have been highly mobile. Catchment areas with
a suggested radius of 30-80 miles suggest a tethered nomadism more
like foragers than collectors (Turner 1989).

On the other hand, exotic chert use at the Higgins site in Anne
Arundel county suggests a very large territory. Ebright (1992:411)
reports that two-thirds of the flaked stone tools were made from
exotic chert, including green Hudson Valley chert far to the
northeast and a mottled chert from southern Virginia.

In contrast to an orientation to cryptocrystalline lithic resources
in the Ridge and Valley province, suggested by Gardner (e.g.,
1989), there seems to be a riverine orientation on the Coastal
Plain, at least in Maryland (Ebright 1992; Wesler et al. 1981:
Vol.2). In the Piedmont as well, the settlement is wide-ranging
with a focus on river zones (Kavanagh 1982).

Paleoindians were present throughout the Appalachian province, at
least during parts of the period. For example, there are no fluted
points in Maryland or Pennsylvania made of rhyolite, but by the
Hardaway-Dalton phase there are rhyolite points in the Maryland
Piedmont, indicating that people are starting to use that area.

Gardner notes the absence of Paleoindian materials on floodplains
and terraces in the Ridge and Valley province. However, Stewart
notes that sites are associated with floodplains, alluvial fans,

and low terraces near small streams. Kit Wesler et al.
(1981:Vol.4:135) suspect that Gardner's quarry-oriented site
distribution represents a truncated upland data set. Both the

Flint Run complex base camps and Shawnee-Minisink are on terraces.
Quarries are likely to have been long term foci for activity, but
riverine settings were probably of equal or greater importance and
evidence for them simply may be obscured by deposition and historic
activity. Wesler and his co-authors expect a foraging economy with
an emphasis on hunting, and twin settlement foci on riverine base
camps and cryptocrystalline lithic quarries.

As stated above, hunter-gatherers depend upon their mobility in the
landscape for security. Scott Parker (1990) looks to
ethnographically known hunter-gatherers for models of social
systems incorporating exchange networks as part of adaptation to
environmental conditions and risks. Although the societies he
chooses, the !Kung of the Kalahari desert of southern Africa and
the aborigines of the Western Desert of Australia, inhabit arid
environments quite unlike the temperate mid-Atlantic, they do offer
relatively well-studied and well-theorized examples of hunter-
gatherer strategies. He expects exchange based on reciprocity and
risk reduction for Archaic period hunter-gatherers. Settlement
systems function to obtain critical resources, but mobile groups
cannot be in close proximity to all resources at all times.

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 137



=== Page 168 ===

Therefore, groups need social processes such as exchange networks
(Parker 1990:113).

Exchange networks are based on material needs and environmental
characteristics but are still social systems with social
structures. Sahlins' continuum of reciprocity and social distance
is useful: closer social ties lead to more generalized reciprocity.
For example, the hxaro exchange system of the !Kung is non-
competitive and provides access to wide variety of resource areas.
It would be impractical to have formal exchange networks based on
prestige through debt relationships because such a system requires
enough surplus to support creditor-debtor relationships. Among
these highly mobile hunter-gatherers, accumulation of wealth is not
only impractical but also socially unacceptable.

Pauline Weissner (1982, 1983) states that hunter-gatherers may
practice some form of generalized reciprocity to allow them to "map
onto" other groups' resources and thereby reduce risk. Hunter-
gatherers may adopt different strategies. If they pool their risk,
then household or band identity would be deemphasized as the
population seeks to blend together. The opposite is expected for
those who use storage. That is, stylistic variation would mark
different memberships. Therefore, there are different strategies
that are dependent not only upon the environmental characteristics,
but also upon the strategies of interaction with other groups.

For the Archaic period mid-Atlantic, it would be reasonable to
examine the structure of exchange systems in the eastern boreal
forest as an analogy for later Paleoindian and Early to Middle
Archaic strategies.

Charles and Buikstra (1983) discuss some of the social-political
implications of Archaic cemeteries on the landscape. Although they
are discussing the Central Mississippi drainage, their theoretical
position and observed relationships are important for understanding
sedentism and territorial marking in the eastern United States in
general. They start with a long-accepted assumption that formal
cemetery areas are associated with corporate lineal inheritance of
crucial and restricted resources. They offer four postulates that
start with the earlier assumption. These are:

1. the use of formal cemeteries correlates with sedentism of
groups using the cemetery;
2. spatial structuring in mortuary behavior correlates with the

degree of competition among groups for resources}

3. within a larger society, corporate groups will be
distinguished by separate cemeteries or in distinct areas
within a cemetery; and

4. inclusion of individuals within the cemetery implies inclusion
in the corporate group.

Ii. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 138


=== Page 169 ===

Clearly, land is a crucial resource and a cemetery is one obvious
way of ritually signifying a relationship to a specific area and
its resources. While they correlate the elaborateness of the
ritual expression to the importance of the required affirmation of
relationship (or competition), they are not willing to make the
case that the lack of a cemetery indicates the lack of resource
competition or an organized claim to resources.

To the point of territoriality and social group identity, Kenneth
Reid (1983:35) has this to say of the Late Archaic in the Lower
Missouri Valley as he seeks to explain the high degree of lithic
biface formalization. The formalization is associated with
unilineal societies increasingly concerned with reproducing
themselves as political and ideological units through time,
rather than with bilateral kindreds preoccupied with
subsistence requirements and equipped with simple flakes and
choppers.
He goes on to characterize the unilineal groups as “competitive,
and demographically expansionist descent groups" and contrasts them
against earlier, reciprocally allied bilateral bands. Reid's
observations are interesting because he seeks to uncover economic
and political contexts for the Archaic-Woodland transition,
including participation in regional exchange, innovation in
ceramics, and population size and density. He seeks to tie
observed archeological changes to changes in strategies for social
reproduction and work force composition.

Two patterns of seasonal movement are offered for early prehistory
in the mid-Atlantic: the cyclical model, and the serial model
(Custer 1990). Evidence for the first, where people move between
base camps focused on quarries, is expected where lithics are few
and widely spaced. The second, where people move between base
camps that are not quarry-related, is expected in areas where there
are numerous small lithic outcrops. It has been suggested that
movements followed the cyclical model in all areas during
Paleoindian and Early Archaic times, with serial movement replacing
this strategy after 8500 BP (Custer 1990). However, as mentioned
above, some researchers have suggested early movement focused on
riverine resources rather than primarily on lithic availability.

Gardner (1974a) suggests a shift in the settlement pattern
accompanying the Early Archaic shift to notched points (Kirk and
Palmer phases). Processing stations appear along floodplain
margins, especially along margins of inland swamps and bogs. In
the Appalachian province of Maryland, large river terraces and
upland swamp margins are used beginning with the Palmer phase (Wall
1991).

In the Southeast Atlantic Slope settlement model for the Early

Archaic (Anderson and Hanson 1988) a combination of collector and
forager strategies is proposed, with seasonal movements on river

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 139



=== Page 170 ===

drainages crosscutting the Coastal Plain and Piedmont. Base camps
are set up in the Coastal Plain in winter and a series of foraging
camps are used the rest of year. Lithic availability is a
constraint in the Coastal Plain, but not in the Piedmont.

Wide-ranging mobility in the earlier Early Archaic, indicated by a
great deal of extralocal lithic material, is followed by decreased
mobility and circumscribed territories, indicated more use of local
raw materials. In the South Atlantic by the beginning of the
Middle Archaic, there is year-round occupation within small
territories (Anderson 1991b).

Common across physiographic provinces is the late Early Archaic
focus on water resources. Interior swamps on the Maryland, New
Jersey, and Delaware coastal plains (Custer 1984), upland and
interior ponds in western Maryland (Wall 199a), and ponds, marshes,
and springheads in the Great Valley (Stewart 1980) all are
increasingly used during the latter part of the Early Archaic.

Settlement pattern changes around 9,000 BP include the increasing
use of upland settings in western Virginia. This use is probably
prompted by the expansion of deciduous species into upland slopes
and summits and to population growth. This expansion reached its
maximum extent during the Late Archaic around c. 5000 BP, when most
of the settlement system remains focused on major drainage
floodplains (Custer 1990),

The settlement pattern hypothesized for the Upper Ohio Valley
Middle Archaic (Cowin 1991) is probably applicable to the upper
Potomac basin. Base camps are located on post-Pleistocene terraces
where riverine and floodplain habitats provided seasonal
subsistence. Procurement stations for plant and animals are located
in the uplands and small lithic reduction camps are near lithic
outcrops.

In the Virginia Piedmont most Early and Middle Archaic sites are
clustered along major drainages. These are primarily small
procurement sites associated with swamps and bogs in uplands and at
springs and seeps and along small low order drainage floodplains
(Custer 1990). In the Maryland Piedmont there is movement for the
first time away from the river to the foothills and uplands
(Kavanagh 1983). Overall, there seems to be a more varied foraging
economy and increasing use of uplands, with continued preference
for riverine settings for the location of base camps (Wesler et al.
1981:vol. 3).

The Fall Line and Coastal Plain are especially poorly known but on
the Coastal Plain freshwater wetlands, swamps, and bogs are the
location for sites from the Paleoindian through the Middle Archaic.
There was opportunistic use of these areas as they became available
with the sea level rise. Coastal areas were not an area of

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 140


=== Page 171 ===

settlement until there were stable resources about 4000 years ago
(Custer 1990).

There was increasing use through the Late Archaic of riverine and
estuarine resources. In both the Piedmont and the Appalachian
province the Late Archaic witnessed the highest dispersal of sites
and the greatest variety of micro-environments. By the end of the
Late Archaic with the Broadspear tradition, there was a shift back
to the main rivers (Stewart 1980; Wesler et al.: vols. 1,4).

Base camps along major drainages supported larger populations and
there is a corresponding decrease of sites in other locations.
Custer (1984) attributes this change to climatic change as warn,
dry conditions decreased the carrying capacity of marginal areas
used earlier.

Late Archaic settlement pattern is marked by increasing
territoriality, reflected in the lithic resources used. For
example, on the Maryland Coastal Plain there is extensive use of
local quartz and quartzite cobble and a dramatic decrease in the
incidence of rhyolite use (Ebright 1992).

Numerous similarities between Late Archaic, Early Woodland, and
early Middle Woodland settlement patterns may mislead archeological
interpretation into assumptions of cultural stasis, an unlikely
situation.

Early Woodland settlement patterns indicate the intensive use of
estuarine resources. During the Late Archaic and Early to Middle
Woodland there was a shift in location of base camps away from
interior swamps to estuarine areas for shellfish in the outer
Coastal Plain (Gardner 1982). The pattern is less clear in the
inner Coastal Plain. The Early Woodiand pattern shows seasonal
interzonal movements between freshwater and saltwater zones, both
of which are highly productive (Gardner 1982).

A new type of site appears in the Appalachian province of the
Potomac Basin during the Early Woodland. The presence of small
stone burial mounds related to the mid-continental Adena is noted
in the Appalachians, extending well into western Maryland (Fowke
1894; Ritchie and Dragoo 1971). Burial mounds and cairns are
reported mounds as far east as Antietam creek in the Hagerstown
Valley (Hill 1831; Stewart 1981).

For the most part, however, Early Woodland sites tend to be in the
same places as those of the Late Archaic. MThere is a riverine
orientation supplemented by upland hunting camps near lurge streams
or stream heads.

During Middle Woodland II, people live on the inner Coastal Plain
along freshwater streams in intermediate size base camps. Storage

II, OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 141


=== Page 172 ===

pits at some of these settlements suggest that these camps were
probably used throughout the year at different times. Smaller
sites, which line the Potomac and its tributaries below the Fall
Line, are probably fishing camps and processing sites for spring
anadromous fish runs (Potter 1993:107). Associated with this use
of the Coastal Plain are sites in other areas. Temporary camps,
for example, are found in the interior uplands of the Piedmont and
sites associated with the collection of rhyolite from the Blue
Ridge are found in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge (Potter 1993:108;
Curry and Kavanagh 1991).

In the Patuxent River drainage on Maryland's Coastal Plain there is
a dramatic change in settlement organization during Middle Woodland
II. Steponaitis (1986) describes and attributes the decline in
residential mobility and increase in logistical procurement
strategy to environmental stress and changes in social relations
and alliance networks (Potter 1993:109-110).

Certainly one of the major effects on settlement pattern as well as
social and political relationships in the Potomac Basin during the
Middle Woodland was the long distance migration of Algonquian
groups to the area from the Great Lakes region. Although the
timing of this migration is unclear, it is likely to have occurred
either early or late in Middle Woodland II (Potter 1993:3-4). It
is possible that environmental stress in the Algonquian homeland,
also seen in drier, cooler periods around 400-500 in the mid-
Atlantic, contributed to this migration.

During the Late Woodland I there was population dispersal in the
Coastal Plain as single large villages split into several smaller
villages. This change in settlement pattern resulted, at least in
part, from two related changes: the introduction of agriculture
and a climatic dry period from 1000-1200 CE (Potter 1993:142).

Around the beginning of Late Woodland II there was a coalescence of
population and after 1,300 CE the settlement pattern is
characterized by large villages. There were also several
population movements of groups between physiographic regions. Some
Montgomery Complex groups moved from the Piedmont to the inner
Coastal Plain, where they are identified archeologically as Potomac
Creek Complex groups (Potter 1993:143-5). They perhaps were
prompted to leave the Piedmont by the arrival of Mason Island
groups who moved there from the west. In the Maryland Piedmont
Late Woodland villages are large and stockaded (Kavanagh 1982), as
are Potomac Creek Complex villages. In the upper Potomac, Late
Woodland villages are palisaded, and closely related to the
Monongahela of the upper Ohio Valley and southwest Pennsylvania.
People of the Luray complex, who moved into the Piedmont around
1,500, seem to have come from this area. Most of the Rappahannock
Complex villages, those of Late Woodland Coastal Plain inhabitants
who were in the lower Potomac before Piedmont groups moved in, are

instead spread out over large areas and are not stockaded (Potter
1993:147).

From his study of shell middens and shellfish gathering, Waselkov
(1982) offers these conclusions about site types and locations from
Middle Woodland II through Late Woodland II. There are small
seasonally occupied oyster gathering sites from the late Middle
Woodland (200 CE), if not earlier. By about 700 CE the first large
villages are occupied for much of year. These are supplemented by
small and intermediate upland hunting camps and oyster gathering
camps. Around 900-1,000 the dominant settlement type consists of
a dispersed large village with individual houses and house
clusters. Around 1,300 small permanent settlements coalesce to form
large villages with some outlying house clusters. By 1,500
villages absorb outliers and are more consolidated but still are
internally dispersed. Houses within villages are so widely spaced
that middens between them are very thin over large areas.

Use of the Landscape during the Historic Period. The Coastal
Plain settlement patterns of Late Woodland II, 1300-1500 CE, are
essentially those in place at the time of European settlement.
There is little ethnohistory concerning the Piedmont, although
there are indications that native groups deserted the area by the
1630s and returned by the end of the 17th century. There are
several references to the return or migration of native groups to
the Piedmont. There was a settlement of Piscataway on Heater's
Island c. 1699-1720 (Snyder 1967; see Wesler 1977) and a return of
Susquehannocks and Shawnee to the Susquehanna River in Baltimore
county (Wesler et al. 1981:vol.4). The 1697 report of John
Oldton, captain, describes the activities of rangers who "have
Ranged and made discovery of all Good Lands back of our Road and
found a great many Indian Cabbins and Tents where we marked Trees
and set up our names" (quoted in Wesler et al. 1981:vol.4). Such
a statement suggest that native Americans were living in the
Appalachian province as settlers were claiming it.

Soon after the initial settlement of Jamestown, the official policy
of the Virginia Company and then the British Crown was to encourage
and demand the formation of towns. However, circumstances in the
Chesapeake region worked against directives from across the sea and
dispersed, largely self-sufficient plantations became the norm
through the 17th and much of the 18th century. The Virginia
Company's policy in the early 17th century is expressed as follows
(quoted in Reps 1972:46):
Wee think it fitt, that the houses and buildings be so
contrived together, as may make if not hansome Townes, yet
compact and orderly villages; that this is the most proper,
and successfull maner of proceedings in new Plantacons,
besides those of former ages, the example of the Spaniards in
the West Indies, doth fully instance.

Miller (1984) describes the rapid tempo of change and marked
fluidity in frontier settlement, social structure, and economics.
Within colonies there is greater spatial simplification and
flexibility as distance from the homeland increases. He indicates
that settlement types found in the 17th-century Chesapeake --
dispersed settlements, semi-nucleated villages, nucleated villages
and frontier towns -- reflect this "colonization gradient" typical
of frontier settlements.

Tobacco and the trade and profit it engendered were major factors
in the dispersion of plantations and people along the deep,
navigable rivers of the Chesapeake drainage. The ease of water
transportation made it possible for trade to take place at
individual plantations and hampered the formation of towns and
cities.

An observer in 1688 wrote (quoted in Reps 1972:58)
No Country in the World can be more curiously watered. But
this Conveniencey...I look on [to be] the greatest Impediment
to the Advance of the Country, as it is the greatest Obstacle
to Trade and Commerce. For the great Number of Rivers, and
the Thinness of the Inhabitants, distract and disperse a
Trade. So tht all Ships in general gather each their Loading
up and down an hundred Miles distant; and the best of Trade
that can be driven is only a Sort of Scotch Pedling; for they
must Carry all Sorts of Truck that trade thither...The Number
of Rivers, is one of the chief Reasons why they have no Towns.

In discussing 17th-century settlement studies, Andrew Edwards and
Marley Brown (1993:291) admire Deetz's (1987, 1988, 1993) analysis
of early regional settlement as a "creative application[{s] of
often-overlooked survey-level evidence to the broader dynamics of
settlement patterns ... in historical archeology." They emphasize
that his analysis of the temporal sequence of Flowerdew Hundred
sites could be done only with archeological data. Results from the
authors' similar study at Carters Grove supported Deetz' results,
which he summarizes (1987:66, quoted in Edwards and Brown 1993;
292-293):
In the early decades of the seventeenth century, tobacco
yielded quick profits and the Flowerdew bottomlands were
settled and farmed evenly... When tobacco no longer was a
source of instant wealth, there was a shrinking of occupation;
families moved nearer the river and away from the center of
the plantation... When slavery made it possible for a person
of relatively modest means to possess a labor source that
enabled him to produce tobacco, settlement expanded again.
Finally, settlement dwindled as the plantation lands came into
the hands of three wealthy planters and finally fall into the
possession of only one.

The correlation of the "temporal structure of early 17th-century
settlement patterns, seen in fluctuating periodicities of site
occupation spans, «+. With economic developments on an
international scale" (Edwards and Brown 1993:301) provide a world
system context for the interpretation of site location,

The system of mercantile capitalism needed towns for centralized

control of administration and trade. It also relied upon colonies

to supply raw materials and therefore colonial manufacturing was

discouraged, although the encouragement of manufacturing and trades

would have helped to encourage towns. John Reps points out that

English policy was contradictory. He (1972:60) writes that
throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries English
colonial administrators continually grumbled about the lack of
towns in Virginia and Maryland...Nothing appeared less natural
and rational than a settlement pattern of small farmers and
large plantations dispersed almost uniformly across the land.
Surely this was quite un-English.

Large plantations, however, served many of the functions of towns,
including the location of crafts. Travelers commented on the
village-like characteristics of large plantations. At the turn of
the 18th century one observer wrote (quoted in Reps 1972:62),
“every Plantation is a little Town of itself, and can subsist
itself with Provisions and Necessaries, every considerable
Planter's Warehouse being like a Shop."

During the 18th century towns were established differently in
Virginia and Maryland. In the former, individuals often laid out
towns on their own land and then sought legislative approval, while
in the latter the General Assembly created towns, often in response
to petition from residents in the proposed areas (Reps 1972:232).
Port Tobacco, originally established in the 17th century, was
reactivated as a town. It and other port towns underwent a similar
sequence: "a period of slow and uncertain development, an era of
prosperity, and ultimate stagnation or decline." Port Tobacco in
Charles County, Maryland and Bladensburg on the Anacostia River
both suffered from the siltation of their harbors and the decline
in the importance of tobacco as the wheat and flour trade moved
prosperity to Baltimore and Alexandria (Reps 1972:243).

Sylvia Fries (1977) describes American colonists as essentially
anti-urban but culturally accepting of the idea that civilization
is nourished and manifest in cities. She writes (1977:xiv) that,
"The symbolic American landscape has included not only the edenic
garden but the New Jerusalem." Fries considers Williamsburg
specifically, but both of the central i8th-century Chesapeake
cities, Williamsburg and Annapolis, were planned in the 1690s to
fulfill the cultural expectations of urban places. A Virginia
clergyman expressed a widespread opinion (quoted in Fries
1977:113):

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 145


=== Page 176 ===

When I have considered the Antiquity of Towns and Cities,
known to aS many as are conversant with Sacred and Profane
History, and the Universal Copy cast us by the whole Christian
and Pagan World, I have been justly amazed to see the
unaccountable Humour and Singularity of Virginia and Maryland,
who have so patiently, and for so long a time, sat down with
a kind of stupid satisfaction under those pressing and
Innumerable Disadvantages both they and their posterity must
still endure, by their scattered and remote Settlements,
without Towns and Cohabitation.

According to Fries' cultural analysis, Williamsburg as an aesthetic

statement was designed to fulfill a largely ceremonial function.

She (1977:129) explains,
The principles of that aesthetic, the principles of formalized
and rationalized harmony achieved through mathematically
contrived proportions, were a projection of a cultural style
adapted by and for an elite planter class to enhance its own
aspirations toward social and political ascendancy. Derived
from a European tradition of the constructed, refined, and
cultivated self it became identified, in the context of its
origins, with the city.

The sequence and seeming purpose of urban places is remarkably
Similar in Virginia and Maryland. Both colonies replaced their
frontier period capitals -- Jamestown and St. Mary's City,
respectively -~ with carefully planned ceremonial capitals at the
end of the 17th century. After the Revolution, these cities'
functions as physical representations of political and social
sovereignty perhaps became unnecessary and the central places
shifted inland to the Fall Line, to Richmond and Baltimore (see
Fries 1977:128). Although Annapolis is still the political capital
of Maryland, economic and social activity centered in Baltimore
during the late 18th and throughout the 19th century. The Federal
city was established as well at the end of the 18th century.
Washington, D.C. is also on the Fall Line between the Coastal Plain
and Piedmont.

Other urban places flourished as well. Georgetown had been
established after 1734 and was authorized as a town in 1751. The
town prospered and grew. During the late 18th century, opinions
about the town's fate varied. Benjamin Stoddert commented in 1783
(quoted in Artemel et al. 1987):
Baltimore was then a flourishing place almost beyond
calculation, and Alexandria was a place of very considerable
commerce. I was urged by my friends to fix myself in each of
these places, but I had reasoned myself into a decided
preference for Georgetown, then entirely destitute of every
appearance of being commercial. There was but one trifling
retail shop in it, and it had not a man who ventured five
pounds on any foreign voyage. Still, I said that no place in

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 146


=== Page 177 ===

this quarter of the union, not Baltimore itself, was
convenient to so great a proportion of the products of the
country as Georgetown, and in such a state of peace I knew
that the commerce of such a place must depend in a great
degree on the products of the country, it was from situation
entirely to receive, and that if this position was correct,
which I could not doubt, that the trade of Baltimore, and of
Alexandria would decline and that of Georgetown would increase
beyond the conception of common minds.

Another man wrote instead of the town's economic disadvantages in

1791 (quoted in Reps 1972:247):
Georgetown is said to have risen to some importance in the
commercial world from the same cause as Baltimore, viz., the
impolitic revenue laws of Virginia, which carried her produce
to Georgetown and sent the imports from Europe, which
otherwise would have gone to Alexandria. The navigation is
certainly not equal to that of Alexandria, for there are some
rocks opposite Georgetown, the channel is narrow and bad, and
no vessel can withstand the ice which comes down the Potomac,
for which reasons insurance cannot be made on vessels till
they have got to the Eastern Branch. The situation of
Georgetown is likewise inconvenient for trade, the land being
very uneven, and full of steep declivities, and hollows, and
lofty eminences, which although beautiful to the eye of the
traveler, and afford delightful prospects, are certainly ill-
calculated for trade.

Core-periphery relationships within a city have been studied in
Alexandria, Virginia (Cressey et al. 1982). The guiding questions
of this research were, broadly, 1) how and why did urban hierarchy
become more highly stratified between the 18th and 20th centuries
and 2) how do archeologically observed relationships among
settlement pattern and material culture patterns address this
stratification.

The archeological study of core-periphery relationships continues
to explore questions on regional and world-wide as well as local
scales. Such core-periphery relationships affect landscape use
and, of course, economic and other interaction.

Rural areas functioned as economic peripheries to local and
regional core areas. Patricia Parker (1986) describes the 17th-
and 18th-century Virginia Piedmont focus on tobacco farming and the
increasing difficulty of living by farming after tobacco farming
devastated the soil and landscape. Herbert Fisher (1983) describes
two major phases of settlement in Louisa county in the Virginia
Piedmont. The first was during the 1730s and 1740s as English
settlers and their black slaves established tobacco plantations,
purposely eroding the land to maintain drainage. The second was
after the Civil War as freed slaves moved to the abandoned tobacco

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 147


=== Page 178 ===

lands, which were eventually lost, abandoned or sold to timber and
pulp wood companies.

Settlement pattern analysis helps to tell the story of migration as
settlers moved across the Piedmont and into the mountains. For much
of the 18th century within the Tidewater area small independent
farmers, tenants, indentured servants, and slaves were all directed
and controlled by the planter elite. In contrast, to the west
there was more ethnic diversity and more economic diversity. In
the mid-18th century, for example, there was an influx of Quaker
and German settlers from Pennsylvania into Loudoun county, Virginia
and Frederick and Washington counties in Maryland. Some of their
culture and building traditions spread east as well, making the
built landscape in the western third of Fairfax county, for
example, look quite different from the eastern portion. Sully
Plantation was one of few plantation-type farms in western Fairfax
built in late 18th century; it relied on diversified crops and was
never a tobacco plantation (Chittenden et al. 1988).

The settlement of Washington and Allegany Counties in Maryland
began by the 1740s with military and trading posts. Thomas Cresap
established a trading post about 1739 near Hagerstown and then
moved to the Oldtown area near Cumberland in the 1740s. Cumberland
and Oldtown on Potomac river were near Warriors Path, a major
north-south Indian trail. Water power and mills were especially
important in Washington County where farmers invested in grain
agriculture. Small mills were established along creeks and
tributaries.

In 1790 there was a limited white population of less than 20,000
west of South Mountain. The completion of the National Road in
1818 brought an influx of population. The Cumberland area was
sparsely settled until the B&O Railroad and the C&O Canal reached
the area in the 1840s and i850s. By 1860 the population of
Cumberland was over 3000 (Sprinkle et al. 1994:9).

As soils became exhausted and the market for tobacco declined, the
nature of agricultural production changed. Crop diversification,
more pasturing of livestock, and new techniques such as crop
rotation and fertilization were adopted. Northern farmers familiar
with these techniques migrated into Virginia in the 1840s. Such
agricultural change affected the spatial organization of areas that
had been organized as plantations. Smaller farms that were less
labor intensive and used more machinery developed. Sources of
craft other than the formerly self-sufficient plantations had to be
established. In northern Virginia, Alexandria remained the major
regional center with luxuries, services, industries (potteries,
breweries, fisheries, shipyards, banks); newspapers, educational
institutions, and lyceums. At transportation crossroads, other
villages grew, such as Centreville, Dranesville, and Falls Church
in Fairfax county (Chittenden et al. 1988). Matildaville, an NPS

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 148


=== Page 179 ===

property in Great Falls, is an example of a town which served and
waS served by major transportation routes, in this case the
Patowmack canal.

During the era of the Civil War northern Virginia was a border
area, both militarily and philosophically. The area was already
very different than rest of state culturally, economically, and
socially; opinions about secession were divided (Chittenden et al.
1988).

The effect of the Civil War on the use of the landscape was far
reaching and  longlasting. Battles, encampments and the
construction of forts had obvious, although often underestimated,
effects. The temporary and permanent displacement of people also
changed settlement patterns. Large-scale migration of escaping
Slaves during the war and freed slaves after the war resulted in
very different demographics in and around the District of Columbia.
A system of refuge camps was established and after the war Congress
created the Freedman's Bureau. Freedmen's villages were
established in Alexandria, Arlington, and Falls Church. Smaller
clusters were organized at Lewinsville, Vienna, Fairfax Station,
Fairfax Courthouse, and Frying Pan, while more isolated communities
grew around black-owned farm land at Lincolnville, Odrick's
Corners, and Gum Springs. The latter community was associated with
Mount Vernon (Chittenden et al. 1988).

The landscapes of plantations and urban estates have been subjected
increasingly to archeological analysis. Larry McKee (1992), for
example, investigates the transformation of slave housing and
plantation landscapes in Virginia during and after the pressures
for slavery reform during the 1830s. He is particularly interested
in the attempted use of housing by owners to better control slaves
and the resistance by slaves to that control.

He explains (1992):

The architectural engineering of social behavior by masters
went beyond simply providing small dwellings for what were
expected to be well-behaved families. Writings in the
agricultural press indicate that planters put strong emphasis
on controlling the visible results of what they considered to
be slave misbehavior: the appearance of slave dwellings and
the yards around then.

McKee (1992:210) summarizes the role of archeology in approaching

the power relations and struggles of life on the plantation.
Slave cabins, both the ones still standing in late 20th
century Virginia and other states and the ones ideally
conceived in the writings of plantation reformers, tell us
about planters' goals and desires for orderly slave
communities. The full context of these dwellings, as provided
by the archeology surrounding them, the histories of their

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 149


=== Page 180 ===

occupants, and a consideration of how groups within a social
setting grapple for power and autonomy, shows how slaves
largely rejected these simplistic attempts to program their
lives by architectural design. When archaeologists attempt to
read artifacts and to divine the intended signals of the
artifact makers, there is a consequent need to try to
understand and reconstruct the responses of those for whom the
objects' message was intended.

The archeological investigation of a 19th-century plantation in
southern Maryland reveals both the landscape mechanisms of control
over slave behavior and the attempts of the owners to use landscape
to symbolically strengthen their place in the social hierarchy of
the region (King 1994).

Other provocative archeological interpretation of 19th-century

landscapes in the area has been done at Harpers Ferry National

Historical Park (Shackel 1993b) in the context of interdisciplinary

investigations. Pollen and phytolith analysis provide clues to

changing yardscapes. Paul Shackel (1994b:9) summarizes:
Significant differences are found between the armory's craft
ethos phase, the armory's industrial phase, and the town's
commercial and residential phase. While pollen and phytolith
grass data are nonexistent in the pre-armory landscape, they
are abundant by the 1820s. New buildings were constructed and
the armory maintained a well-groomed landscape. But the
garden-like landscape disappeared by the 1840s _ when
industrialization no longer had to be justified as coexisting
harmoniously with nature.

Particularly interesting to rural industrial landscape studies are
the planned industrial communities of Lonaconing, Mount Savage, and
Weverton in Western Maryland. These towns were all laid out by
industrial companies. The first mill in Weverton in Pleasant
Valley, Washington County, was built in 1846 and lasted until 1860.
Initially, the company planned to rival Lowell, Massachusetts. Both
Lonaconing and Mount Savage were built for iron production in 1837
to use local George's Creek coal for fuel. Iron production was
successful in Lonaconing for only 3 years but reopened in 1842 for
mining only. Mount Savage shut down in 1868 with production of
iron and steel replaced by fire clay and brick (Wesler et al,
1981:Vol.4).

During the World War I era, northern war production recruited
tenant farmers to supply labor, thereby starting the "Great
Migration" of blacks to the north that lasted until the 1960s. The
Fairfax County plan (Chittenden et al. 1988) identifies three
themes which may be related to racially-influenced use of the
landscape in the region as a whole, since black and white
population centers tended to be separate, even within the same
town. In addition, developments in Fairfax County, Virginia are

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/LANDSCAPE 150


=== Page 181 ===

likely to have had some impact in the surrounding area. These
themes are: 1) steady growth of black population until after the
turn of the 20th century followed by absolute and relative decline
thereafter; 2) coalescence of blacks into communities largely
segregated from whites, first by custom and later by law; and 3)
continual struggle by blacks for economic and social acceptance
into the wider society.

Interaction Within and Between Societies

Interaction studies comprise a large and important part of
archeological thought. Interaction refers to contacts between and
among individual societies. In a recent book Edward Schortman and
Patricia Urban (1992:3) explain that "interaction studies," as a
focus of archaeological inquiry,
refers to research founded on the notion that individual
societies, or 'cultures,' are not viable but depend on inputs
from other societies for survival and reproduction from
generation to generation.

They contrast interaction studies with cultural ecology, which was
the reigning theoretical paradigm in American archeology in the
1960s and 1970s. Cultural ecology emphasized internal mechanisms
with such models as feedback loops and homeostatic mechanisms
operating within territorially-bounded ecosystems. As was pointed
out in the introductory discussion of economy, the causes in this
approach tend to be technoenvironmental rather than social. In the
creation of a new school of interaction studies, Schortman and
Urban (1992:11) hope that the best threads of earlier research will
be adopted.

The goal of interaction research is to write "total histories" by
placing developments within a rich network of connections
maintained by each society. Schortman and Urban's work highlights
three types of interregional interaction: world systems, trade, and
warfare; but certainly other categories such as migration,
acculturation, and ethnic group formation and disintegration could
be specified.

Research issues important to interaction studies include the

following (Shortman and Urban 1992).

As What is the significance of elite control over basic
subsistence resources as opposed to luxury resources as a
foundation for controlling labor?

2. Is adaptation a significant concept in understanding
sociopolitical impact of interregional linkages? In other
words, what is the relationship between elite strategies to
promote their own well-being and the needs of a whole society?

= How is labor distributed among cores and peripheries and to
what extent are peripheries underdeveloped in relation to the
cores?

4. What is the role of warfare in the stabilization of exchange
for the benefit of cores?

5. What is the sociopolitical significance of persistent
conflict?

6. Within a context of competition and threat, what strategic use
of visible material forms stresses unity in the face of
powerful oppressors?

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/INTERACTION 152


=== Page 183 ===

Following are brief discussions of three kinds of interaction:
world system, trade and exchange, and conflict and warfare. None of
these topics is limited to any particular time period. Because
more archeological attention has been focused on trade and
exchange, there is more background information provided. The scale
of the "world" in a world system may change greatly; however, in
the historic period it becomes increasingly global. Following
these summaries is a discussion of some aspects of interaction in
the mid-Atlantic. This example is neither exhaustive nor
comprehensive, but serves to illustrate the sorts of issues which
may be addressed archeologically.

World Systems. Many archeologists have embraced the world system
ideas of Immanuel Wallerstein (1974, 1980, 1989) and have
critically adapted them. World systems are not necessarily global
but comprise an arena of interaction with more than one cultural
grouping. World systems are not necessarily politically unified
whereas world empires are. World economies connect more than one
political system. There are also minisystems that are
territorially small and rely on reciprocal exchange. The most
familiar part of the model is the three-part characterization of
regions as core, semiperiphery and periphery based on relative
economic centrality and power. Archeologists using Wallerstein's
model recognize that despite similarities or regularities each
system is unique (Schortman and Urban 1992:21).

The impact of the European world system on native cultures develops
over the period of initial and sustained contact. The relationship
of the colonial settlers also changes within the world economy.
International competition was played out in the New World colonies
and developments must be viewed in that context.

Trade and Exchange. The study of trade complements a world-system
perspective. The political context of exchange is one way to
investigate regional power relations. Peter Wells (1992:175)
writes that it is far too simple to define trade as the peaceful
transmission of goods since “any interaction resulting in the
movement of goods between societies involves complex economic,
social, and political processes and raises numerous questions."

To establish sociopolitical preeminence, developing elites must
“extract surpluses and services from their followers while
maintaining the simulacrum of reciprocal relations among different
social levels" (Schortman and Urban 1992:15). In other words,
those who wish to gain power must make their followers willingly
dependent and convince them that the system is just and fair. The
symbolic character of exchange within and between regions is
crucial for developing and maintaining political ideology. Luxury

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 153


=== Page 184 ===

or prestige goods, called “preciosities" by Wallerstein, are
politically important.

A cultural ecology approach traditionally argues that elite control
rests on control over local basic resources like land and water.
Schortman and Urban (1992:155) accept that such control is
important but write that "access to and control over local
resources is mediated through the manipulation of '‘'luxuries'."
Mechanisms for moving goods include gift-giving, plunder from
raids, protection payments, and “real trade," i.e., peaceful
exchange (Wells 1992:176).

Meltzer (1984:27-28) notes five conditions to document exchange
archeologically: 1) knowledge of raw material source area; 2)
demonstration of group territoriality; 3) location of territory in
relation to resource; 4) knowledge of mobility of settlement
system; and 5) demonstration that raw material doesn't occur in
territory naturally.

Stewart (1989) identifies two forms of exchange in the mid-
Atlantic: broad-based, which has two variants, and focused. In the
first variant of broad-based exchange there is a distinct fall-off
of traded material 30-50 miles away from the source:
The noted distributions are a fingerprint of both the
distinctive territories of groups or bands who can procure a
material directly, and down-the-line exchange of tools and
implements of these same materials [Stewart 1989:52).

The second variant of broad-based exchange, called hoarding,
exhibits the same fall-off but territories at some distance have an
unusually high percentage of trade items. Stewart, however, does
not consider this pattern as indicative of formalized or elite
trade. He (1989:55) explains:
The documented volume and distribution of traded artifacts
throughout the region argues against the existence of groups
with preferential access to specific sources of material or
production centers. The geographic extent of .. . {certain
resources] would have precluded the control of any of these
resources by a particular group.

Hoarding indicates manipulation of traded goods by local groups.
In general, broad-based systems correspond to kin-based sharing and
exchange and related hoarding (Stewart 1989:65).

The focused form of exchange is indicated by items which are not
drawn off of the broad-based networks. It indicates that local
people have somehow inserted themselves into other broad-based
networks. Focused exchange networks:
involved relatively few contacts, not the series of
interlocked, down-the-line transactions associated with broad-
based systems. Artifacts related to focused networks show

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 154


=== Page 185 ===

extremely discontinuous spatial distributions, not down-the-
line decreases, and are found in both burial and general site
contexts. While some exchanged items show signs of having
served functional lives prior to being discarded, others do
not (Stewart 1989:66)}.

Several kinds of personal interactions of hunter-gatherers could
result in the exchange of goods. Such actions include (Stewart
1989:66): 1) obligatory sharing and gift-giving founded on kinship
ties; 2) fission-fusion of communities; 3) payment of marriage
dowries; 4) establishment of personal relationships and trading
partnerships; 5) redistribution of goods at feasts and ritual.

In politically complex societies there are additional actions which
result in exchange, such as collection of tribute and tax and the
chiefly redistribution of various material. Various motivations of
the elite for power and prestige may initiate focused exchange,
particularly to gain exotic goods (Stewart 1989:66).

Conflict and Warfare. Warfare and conflict have received less
attention within interregional interaction theory than is needed.
Studies of domination and resistance (e.g., Miller et al. 1989)
tend to focus on symbolic expressions, especially in response to
threats to autonomy. Stephen Athens (1992) highlights ethnicity as
an adaptive strategy within an intensely competitive social
environment. Although interregional interaction is often seen as
creating a context for group blending, there is also separation of
social groups, especially those in competition for scarce resources
(Athens 1992).

Interaction of mid-Atlantic Societies. According to Stewart
(1989), extensive exchange networks first become visible in the
mid-Atlantic after 2,500 BCE, during the Late Archaic. He

attributes earlier exchange or the presence of exotic goods to
expansive territories, frequent movement, and unpatterned exchange
or gift-giving. As might be expected from general characteristics
of the Late Archaic, exchange is interrelated with group
territoriality and population growth and cyclical use of resources.
Its purposes include the transfer of information, the reduction of
potential conflict, and the creation of networks to serve as
subsistence insurance (Stewart 1989),

During the Late Archaic several types of materials are recognizable
as traded. Argillite, copper, jasper, rhyolite, soapstone, and
ironstone have sources within the mid-Atlantic region. Flints and
cherts from the Ohio Valley and Midwest, Canada, and Tennessee;
marine shell, and obsidian are from outside the region (Stewart
1989:51). Perishables probably also were traded, but leave no
record. Most Late Archaic exchange is broad-based. Focused

=== Page 186 ===

exchange is sporadic during the Late Archaic and is seen in the
distribution of some lithics, shell, and copper (Stewart 1989:56).

The manufacture and exchange of steatite vessels is a hallmark of
the end of the Late Archaic period. A transitional "soapstone
culture" was identified by John Witthoft (1953) and William Ritchie
(1969) to describe the association of steatite vessels with large-
stemmed broadspears of the Susquehanna and Savannah River
traditions. Ritchie (1969:162) suggests that the Washington, D.C.
area, rich in steatite, was core of movement northward for this
soapstone culture. William Henry Holmes speculated the same in
1898 (Humphrey and Chambers 1985:13).

Steatite occurs at various places in the Piedmont. Along the Fall
Line this weather-resistant stone is exposed and forms major
outcrops that became the sites of quarries. The Rose Hill quarry
in the District was excavated in 1890-1891 by Holmes, who
reconstructed the technical sequence of the manufacture of steatite
vessels (Holmes 1890; 1897).

As an area of contact and overlap between two major traditions, the
Piedmont lowlands present an important opportunity to study the
Late Archaic/Early Woodland mixing and recombination of the
Savannah River and Susquehanna broadspear traditions (Rust 1983).
William Rust observes a gradient of rhyolite use decreasing down
the Potomac River and quartzite use decreasing upriver, with the
midpoint around Selden Island. There is also more mixing of lithic
materials in the interior stream drainages and floodplains than on
the upper terraces. It may be interpreted that Savannah River
cultures were using the upper terrace quartzite cobble sources as
well as the floodplains and that the Broadspear groups were using
the floodplains and streams. Rust interprets the Early Woodland
merging of the two traditions as including the emergence of
quartzite use promoted by the migration of groups to the Piedmont
from the Coastal Plain.

During the Early Woodland these items were added to those traded
during the Late Archaic: ceramics; pipestone clay; Onondaga,
Indiana, and Tennessee cherts; and slates (Stewart 1989:56). Early
in the period, exchange of chipped stone items declined in volume
but maintained its earlier geographic extent. Exchange was both
broad-based and involved hoarding. Steatite-tempered pottery was
as widely distributed as earlier steatite vessels had been (Stewart
1989:57). Early focused exchange is found north of the Potomac
Basin in west and central New York.

After 600/500 BCE, there was a dramatic increase in both quantity
and extent of exchanged materials from outside the mid-Atlantic.
The trade in exotic, Adena-like material continues through the
early Middle Woodland. Both broad-based exchange and hoarding
continued and there was focused exchange as well. On the Delmarva

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 156


=== Page 187 ===

peninsula, east of the Potomac Basin, there is impressive evidence

for long-distance exchange. Commenting on the source of this mid-

continental trade, Stewart (1989:57) writes:
It has long been assumed that the Monongahela~Potomac
drainages were a major trade route for Adena-like exotics
reaching the Delmarva Peninsula and points north...A small
center of mound building, possibly dating to this period and
later times, occurs along sections of the Potomac River as it
cuts through the Great Valley, but its relation with Adena-
like phenomena is uncertain.

There is no direct evidence for contact between the Great Valley
and the Coastal Plain. Because there is not evidence for chain-
like exchange between the Adena heartland and the Delmarva
peninsula, direct and focused exchange is postulated (Stewart
1989:58).

Sedentary village societies may have developed in Virginia in the
James River drainage as early as the Early Woodland (Mouer 1991la).
In developing an Early Woodland sequence for the James River Inner
Coastal Plain, Mouer (199la) finds that the area probably was not
habitually occupied but was used by a variety of groups normally
living elsewhere. Archeologists should not be surprised, Mouer
writes, to find sedentary tribal societies before the introduction
of cultigens. Northwest coast societies can serve as an analogy
for competition over very productive areas and the balance of power
between groups. Such competition may lead to the formation of
buffer zones and reorganization of groups into year-round
settlement.

Mouer suggests that there may have been intraregional competition
between Susquehanna Complex groups from the north and estuarine-
adapted groups to the southeast. Some of the evidence for this
competition includes: squeezing of particular groups’. into
restricted, nonriverine habitats; intergroup violence evidenced by
dismembered bodies at the site of Currituck on the Outer Coastal
Plain of the James; and transregional trade in steatite, gorgets,
and axes meant to integrate general use of buffer zones and
alleviate conflict. Mouer draws a parallel with historically
documented long-term blood feuds and boundary wars to explain some
of the developments during the Early Woodland. Much of the Coastal
Plain and uplands of the James River appears to have been used as
a buffer zone during the Early Woodland while sedentism increased
in the Piedmont and below the mouth of the Chesapeake (Mouer
1991a:26).

The Early Woodland, then, may witness the beginning of the Fall
Line buffer zone that was observed in the 17th century as a
boundary between the Siouan and Algonkian societies of Piedmont and
Coastal Plain Virginia (Turner 1978; Mouer 1991a). It was

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/INTERACTION 157


=== Page 188 ===

certainly in place by the end of the Middle Woodland and is
archeologically identifiable by 900 CE (Potter 1993:142).

Stewart (1989) feels that trade during the Middle Woodland is much
like that of earlier periods, that is, with little formalization.
During the early part of the period there is a reduction in the
broad-based exchange of lithics. Group territories are also less
extensive than previously. After 200 CE, however, through the
Middle Woodland, there is an increase in exchange as goods flow
from the west to the Coastal Plain. Some Coastal Plain groups were
making trips to collect raw material directly. Coastal Plain
pottery found in Piedmont and Blue Ridge rockshelters near rhyolite
quarries and workshops is evidence of their trips (Curry and
Kavanagh 1991; Potter 1993:107-108). Focused exchange with mid-
continent cultures may be indicated by burial mound complexes in
the Great Valley of Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, and the
presence there of such materials as "Marginella beads, mica sheets,
quartz crystals, copper crescents and beads, blades of Ohio Valley
cherts/flints, and gorgets of Carolina slates" (Stewart 1989:62).
Although the volume of trade as a whole is greater during the later
part of the Middle Woodland, the frequency of copper items declines
dramatically after 200/300 CE (Stewart 1989:62).

During the Middle Woodland, the most important interactions may
have resulted from migrations of peoples into the Potomac Basin and
between physiographic regions within the Basin. The long-distance
migration of Algonquian speakers from the north, the movement of
Mason Island people from the west to the Potomac Piedmont, and the
movement of Montgomery Complex peoples from the Piedmont to the
Coastal Plain are the major population redistributions (Potter
1993).

During the Late Woodland, regional interactions are a significant
influence on the development of native cultures. There is little
archeological evidence of trade, but cultural interaction is
indicated by stylistic and cultural traits. There is a severe
decline in the broad-based exchange of lithics and very little
evidence for hoarding within the much smaller group territories
which are characteristic of the period (Stewart 1989). It is
suggestive of increasing nucleation of group activities that the
cessation of the trade in rhyolite blanks on Virginia's Northern
Neck around 900 CE correlates with the appearance of
agriculturally-based village sites in the Piedmont (Potter
1993:141-142).

However, ceramics and pipes were traded through both broad-based
and focused exchange from the Ridge and Valley province and the
Coastal Plain of Maryland to the Delmarva peninsula (Stewart
1989:63). Marine shell ornaments and unmodified shell are the only
items traded more frequently during the Late Woodland. Copper

=== Page 189 ===

artifacts, often associated with burials, indicate focused exchange
(Stewart 1989).

Mark Seeman (1981:105) proposes a possible emerging East Coast-
Midwest trade during the Late Woodland following the decline of the
Hopewell trade:
AS support, one could point not only to the replacement of
Ohio pipestone by steatite across much of the Midwest, but
also to the east-west diffusion of pentagonal arrow points,
barbed bone harpoons, and so forth over much of this area.
He suggests that steatite is traded west from the mid-Atlantic,
although he acknowledges that tracing sources of the stone is quite
difficult.

During the Late Woodland contact through trade diminished, but the
cultural world became an increasingly complicated place. Stewart
(1993:172-173) writes about the "world system" comprised of the
several different cultures in the Mid-Atlantic:

population growth during early segments of the Late Woodland

period result in the fissioning of settlements
(hamlets/villages), and the expansion of new groups into
previously unoccupied areas. Through time population

densities reach the point where further fissioning and
expansion of populations and settlements are not possible.
Evidence of increasing population densities is seen in the
location of sedentary settlements in more _ peripheral
environments . . . Nucleation into planned villages,
intensification of subsistence production, concomitant
elaborations in social organization, and ultimately, inter-
group conflict are the presumed results...In short, the
cultural landscape has filled to the point where changes in
one part of the Late Woodland "world system" influence other
components or members of the system. Late Woodland cultural
changes in the Middle Atlantic Region must be studies and
understood at different scales -- local, regional, and the
"world."

During the Late Woodland there were influences on the Potomac
Valley from surrounding areas (e.g., Geier 1992). The Monongahela
culture of the upper Ohio Valley influenced the upper Potomac
(Stewart 1993). The Late Woodland people of the Paw Paw area in the
upper Potomac had some degree of interaction with people of
surrounding areas. Influences are seen in ceramic characteristics
and suggest affiliations with three areas: 1) Monongahela and Ohio
River drainages to the northwest, related to Fort Ancient of Ohio
Valley; 2) upper Shenandoah River and Great Valley to east; and 3)
upper Susquehanna to north and northeast, related to Owasco and
Clemson Island (Kavanagh 1984). Describing the early Late Woodland
pottery of the upper Potomac and hypothesizing about its makers,
Henry Wright (1959) writes,

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 159


=== Page 190 ===

This group is closely related to the so-called Montgomery
Focus found in Zone B of the Shepard Site which is located on
the Middle Potomac... The Morgan People are probably related
to the Owasco Aspect of New York and similar groups scattered
throughout the Northeast. They were apparently absorbed by
the invading early Late Prehistoric group.

A generalized interaction sphere from New York to North Carolina
influenced the Ridge and Valley region. In the upper and middle
Potomac valley before the late Late Woodland, 1,300/1,400 CE,
settlement was in small, unfortified villages, similar to those of
the Shenandoah Valley. In the Ridge and Valley and Appalachian
areas the presence of mounds and rock cairns is similar to that in
the middle and upper Susquehanna Valley. After 1,300/1,400 CE,
burial mounds and cairns disappear from both the upper Potomac and
the northern Shenandoah and stockaded villages with outlying

hamlets form the dominant settlement pattern. In the middle
Potomac Valley mounds also disappear and some villages are
stockaded. In the Coastal Plain, there is the rise of petty

chiefdoms (Stewart 1993).

After 1,300/1,400 CE, there is increased evidence for hostilities,
although there is probably sporadic and perhaps even sustained
inter-group violence prior to this, as suggested by Mouer's (1991a)
findings for the James River during the Early Woodland. Palisades
around villages attest to the need for defense.

Given the competition and both potential and realized hostilities,
it is not surprising that social and/or ethnic boundaries and their
material culture markers seem to become more visible and more
important during the Late Woodland. Custer, for example, notes the
possible use of petroglyphs in the lower Susquehanna Valley (1989)
and various ceramic motifs (1987) as cultural boundary markers.

At the time of successful European settlement, the Powhatan
chiefdom was the largest and most complex social organization in
the region. There was political control by a single leader, the
power of taxation and tributary rights, high ranking religious
specialists, incipient hereditary class ranking, and special
mortuary rights and privileges (Fitzhugh 1985; Potter 1993). The
territory of the Powhatan extended from the Potomac to the James
River and inland to Richmond. This area of approximately 16,500
square kilometers was divided into 31 districts, each controlled by
a district chief (male werowance or female weroangua) subject to a
sub-chief ultimately under the rule of the paramount chief
(mamanatowick) (Potter 1993).

William Fitzhugh (1985) questions if the Powhatan chiefdom is
entirely indigenous or whether its development was stimulated by
European contact. Several researchers (Binford 1964; Rountree 1989,
1990; Turner 1985; Potter 1993) provide evidence to support that it

Ii. OVERVIEW: ECON/INTERACTION 160

-—e*e


=== Page 191 ===

was in place earlier. Fitzhugh suggests that there may be a
connection between European military goals during the 1500s and
native political reaction. However, indigenous chiefdom
development is supported by Late Woodland developments, including
a major shift in population concentration to the core area of the
Powhatan chiefdom, agricultural stress, redistribution. Local
settlement patterns observed in 1,500-1,650 CE are in place by
1,300-1,500 CE (Potter 1993),

Jamestown settlers traded a variety of European goods to indigenous
people in return for maize and later for furs. During the earliest
contact the leaders of Algonquian society “sought to control the
flow of European goods into aboriginal society, much as they
controlled the flow of luxury and status items gathered through
tribute from their own people" (Potter 1989:151).

The werowances paid tribute to the paramount chief from the tribute

they themselves collected from their own groups. In 1612 William

Strachey wrote,
Every Weroance knowes his owne Meeres and lymitts to fish
fowle or hunt in (as said before) but they hold all of their
great Weroance Powhatan, unto whome they paie 8. parts of 10.
tribute of all the Commodities which their Countrey yeildeth,
as of wheat [i.e., corn], pease, beanes, 8. measures of 10.
(and these measured out in little Cades or Basketts which the
great king appoints) of the dying roots 8. measures of ten; of
all sorts of skyns and furrs 8. of tenne, and so he robbes the
poore in effect of al they have even to the deares Skyn
wherewith they cover them from Could, in so much as they dare
not dresse yt and put yt on untill he have seene yt and
refused yt; for what he Comaundeth they dare not disobey in
the least thing [quoted in Potter 1989:153].

Prestige goods, particularly copper, were strictly controlled.

Powhatan, as reported by Strachey in 1612, tried to
monopolize all the Copper brought into Virginia by the
English: and whereas the English are now content, to receave
in Exchange a few measures of Corne for a great deale of that
mettell...Powhatan doth againe vent some smale quantety
thereof to his neighbour Nations for 100. tymes the value,
reserving notwithstanding for himself a plentiful quantety
[quoted in Potter 1989:156].

Trade eventually had the effect of diminishing the authority of the
werowances and the Paramount Chief. By the middle of the 17th
century a number of factors, including "population decline,
displacement or loss of land, discrediting of the priesthood
through its ineffectiveness against European diseases, and perhaps
loss of clear matrilineal successors to the chieftainship" (Potter
1989:160) had weakened the werowances' power and thereby their
control over tribute and trade.

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/INTERACTION 161


=== Page 192 ===

The chiefdom was disintegrated by 1646, barely two generations
after the founding of Jamestown. The effect of disease is
difficult to assess but the effects of violent conflict are better
documented. Extensive hostilities among native groups and between
them and the English are described by Potter (1993).

By 1619 there were 900 English settlers in Virginia in 25
plantations; by 1622 there were another 23 plantations. Powhatan
attacked English settlements in 1622. By 1644 the English
population in the Coastal Plain was over 8,000 and hostilities
continued. A formal peace treaty in 1646 effectively subjugated
the chiefdom to the British crown, collecting yearly tribute to the
governor from Powhatan. In 1669 a census listed 2,000 Powhatan in
Virginia; a 1666 census counted 40,000 English.

Hantman (1990a) describes the complex political relationships
between the interior, Siouian Monacan and the Algonquian Powhatan.
Copper was a key symbol of power and authority in the complex
social and political life of the Algonquian. The Monacans were
probably a source for vital Algonquian copper at the same time
there were political and military enemies (Hantman 1990a:685).
English copper traded by Jamestown settlers was politically charged
in ways that the English almost certainly did not fully comprehend
as Powhatan manipulated it to increase his own regional power.

Some differences in the type of contact between Europeans and
native groups are evident comparing Maryland and Virginia. Within
the Chesapeake, Frederick Fausz (1985) traces a development from
fascination and hospitality to fear and hostility to cooperative
alliances. In Maryland there was a change in English policy to
emphasize trade rather than direct conquest. The immediate and
long-range effects of this difference in the colonies' policies and
histories should include such archeologically visible patterns as
intra- and inter-site settlement, evidence of trade, and patterns
of syncretic material culture.

In his contact theme study for National Historic Landmarks, Robert
Grumet (1992) summarizes many of the issues and well-documented
sites for North Atlantic, mid-Atlantic and Trans-Appalachian
regions. The sub-regions directly relevant for the Potomac Basin
are the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers in the mid-Atlantic and the
Maryland and Virginia Uplands in the Trans-Appalachian region.

The 17th century saw a series of wars, including the Powhatan wars
between 1609-1646. The rapid movement of many peoples, the mixing
of groups undergoing rapid cultural change, the establishment of
refuge communities, missions, and far-reaching economic changes
create some of the challenges facing archeologists who wish to
investigate 17th-century life in the region. For example, in 1675
the Susquehannock established a short-lived fortified settlement on
the Potomac River near the Accokeek Creek site. Piscataway were

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/INTERACTION 162


=== Page 193 ===

trapped in Zekiah Swamp by the Susquehannock in 1680-81. Jesuits
and then Franciscans established missions along the Potomac in the
1640s (Grumet 1992). All of these events are tantalizing to
archeologists interested in Native American ethnocide and
ethnogenesis. The exploration of refuge sites is an important
research issue.

During the 18th century a few thousand Indians remained along the
coast, but to the west the Iroquois continued to greatly influence
the Appalachian frontier.

The Monongahela culture along the Allegheny River, the Lower
Monongahela Valley, and the Upper Ohio and Potomac, is marked by
oblong longhouses in fortified towns on defensible hilltops.
Sixteenth-century Monongahela towns are found on the hills and high
terraces of western Maryland, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern
West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. There may have been quite a bit
of ethnic, social and linguistic variation within Monongahela
groups, influenced by the Iroquois to the northeast and by Fort
Ancient to the west (Grumet 1992:259).

On i17th-century sites European wares are found with various
Monongahela wares (Grumet 1992:259). It is possible that the
Iroquois dispersed earlier inhabitants by 1635. During the 18th
century dispossessed Delaware, Shawnee, and others moved into the
area, again creating a dynamic archaeological record containing the
evidence of migration and interaction.

Relatively little is known of 17th-century groups such as the
Mannahoacs, Monacans, Occaneechis, and Saponis west of the Virginia
Fall Line (Grumet 1992:256). There are very few known remains from
the 18th century as well. Mary Ellen Hodges (1993) feels that the
archeology of native American life in the context of European
contact has been, for the most part, disappointing, particularly
west of the Blue Ridge.

The site of an early 18th-century Shawnee village on the C&O Canal
near Cumberland, Maryland holds great potential for addressing some
of these questions.

Relatively little information is available on the first Africans to
be brought into the region. The first known Africans were brought
to Virginia by a Dutch trading ship in 1619. They were either
servants or slaves, as there was no legal recognition of slavery as
an institution in Virginia in the early 17th century. It seems as
if for the first few decades Africans made up about 2% of the
population. By 1700 Africans and African Americans made up about
10% of the non-Indian population of Virginia. The 300 Africans
recorded as residing in Virginia in 1649 are described as
"servants," but their legal status is unclear. The first law
acknowledging hereditary slavery passed in 1662. In 1670 non-

II. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 163


=== Page 194 ===

Christians imported into the colony were declared slaves for life
and by 1682 legislation was passed that kept Africans as slaves
even if they were Christians. Thus, by the third quarter of the
17th century, racially based slavery of Africans and African
Americans was firmly institutionalized both legally and socially
(Davidson 1994).

During the 19th century there were three waves of immigration from
Europe to the United States. The first started around 1844; the
second started during the Civil War and lasted until 1873; the
third began 1878 and lasted until 1898 (Noble 1992:7). Allen Noble
discusses ethnic landscapes which resulted partly as a result of
these large population movements. He lists both positive and
negative factors which influence the clustering of ethnic
settlement. These factors may vary in rural and urban setting.
They apply to racial as well as ethnic neighborhoods.

Noble (1992:23) summarizes:

Among the positive factors were (1) the presence of ethnic
fellows speaking a common language and offering mutual
support, (2) the low level of inner-city rents, (3) the
location of appropriate churches and other ethnically oriented
institutions, and (4) close proximity to places of employment
or to public transportation routes, Negative elements
included: (1) the residential segregation practiced in
"better" neighborhoods, (2) higher rent levels in the outer
city, (3) the necessity to use the English language in most
parts of the city, (4) and the overt discrimination found in
both public and private facilities.

He also comments of the cohesiveness and visible elements of the

ethnic landscape (1992:401):
homogeneity produces a material culture landscape that is
easily recognizable by members of the community itself and,
with instruction and exposure, to members of the larger
surrounding society. The presence of a distinctive material
culture landscape is a major factor in promoting group
consciousness in rural areas, and it has an effect even in
urban areas, where it may be expressed mostly by signs being
in a vernacular language and by distinctive church
architecture.

Some of the related issues which historical archeology addresses is
the creation, maintenance and dissolution of such neighborhoods.
Not only the landscape emphasized by Noble but also the consumer
habits, buying patterns, and food choice and preparation are
markers of ethnic identity. Historical archeology contributes to
the investigation of different theories of ethnic tenacity.

Three of the main theories of ethnic tenacity are as follows (Noble
1992:400). In the “melting pot theory," groups ultimately lose

Il. OVERVIEW: ECON/ INTERACTION 164


=== Page 195 ===

their identities and get submerged into larger identity. Under
"cultural pluralism" there is continued independent survival of
various ethnic groups, although they may survive in modified form.
In “ethnic revival theory" acculturation swings like a pendulum
between generations. The first generation is ethnic; the second is
unsure about its ethnicity and Americanizes; the third generation
can explore its ethnic heritage with confidence.

Archeology has a role to play in researching various aspects of the
Civil War and its aftermath. Clarence Geier and Susan Winter
(1994) and the contributors to their volume emphasize and
demonstrate this point. Indeed, archeology may be particularly
valuable in examining the larger context of the war, which is
essential to understanding the United States during the latter half
of the 19th century and the 20th century. Geier (1994:191-192)
puts this succinctly:
Though the Civil War has been recognized as an important,
often romanticized event of history, many of its students have
treated it as if it were a self contained event. For all the
war's epic quality, the conduct and cessation of hostilities
were certainly not ends in themselves. Instead, the war must
be regarded as the beginning of a progression of major
economic, social, political, demographic, and philosophical
events that have shaped, and continue to shape, our nation.

Case studies in Civil War archeology have been conducted by mid-

Atlantic regional archeologists in the National Park Service at

Petersburg, the Wilderness, and City Point National Parks in

Virginia. They have explored the following topics (Orr 1994:23):
(1) the experience of soldiers in combat, (2) the disruption
of civilian domesticity by battle and siege, (3) the necessity
of understanding the historical and archeological evidence in
terms of a larger cultural landscape encompassing both past
and present, (4) the didactic value of sites and the great
opportunities they present to communicate a challenging array
of interpretive themes.

Some of the best preserved Civil War fortifications and campgrounds
are on the mountains surrounding Harpers Ferry. In the National
Capital Area, archeologists have documented these remains on
Maryland and Loudoun Heights (Frye and Frye 1989; Winter and Frye
1992).

There are topics related to the Civil War era which have little to
do with the battles themselves and everything to do with the
changes affecting the country. For example, Shackel (1994a)
explores the complex connections between the Civil War and
industrialization and the commemoration of the War, the development
of tourism, and the celebration of selected stories about the past.

Historians and historical archaeologists have studied 19th-century
Southern agriculture, including post-war tenant farms and the newly
freed labor force of former slaves. Charles Orser (1994) points
out that the rural North was also affected by the war, although its
transformations have received much less scholarly attention. He
describes social and economic relations of farmers in the corn belt
of the Midwest during the Civil War era and documents important
shifts in the structure of northern agriculture.

"Whatever one's perspective regarding the effects of the Civil War
on industrial life, it cannot be doubted that the war played at
least some role in helping to transform the United States from a
rural to an industrial nation" (Orser 1994:175). Historical
archaeology researches this transformation.

PREVIOUS SURVEY AND PREDICTIVE SITE MODELS IN THE POTOMAC BASIN
Previous Survey

Professional archeological work in the Potomac basin began during
the late 19th century. There has also been a great deal of
avocational activity which has contributed much information on site
locations.

The explosive growth of Cultural Resource Management since the
1970s has provided a great number of small and large scale surveys
throughout the mid-Atlantic. The Potomac basin lacks any
comprehensive cartographic record of the location of surveys
although the locations of sites are recorded in state and district
Historic Preservation Office site files. A long-term project is
underway in Maryland to include survey boundaries in an
archeological GIS data base.

Several compilations guide the researcher to the usually
unpublished information on archeological survey. These sources
include those by Howard MacCord (1990); Michael Smolek, Dennis
Pogue and Wayne Clark (1984); Mark Wittkofski (1991); and
Wittkofski et al. (1989).

Some survey has extended across boundaries of physiographic
regions. For example, William Gardner and Charles McNett (McNett
n.d.) have conducted an extensive survey of work in the Potomac
basin, but the results of their research are not yet available.
The Maryland State Highways Administration sponsored a statewide
overview and survey along selected road corridors. The results are
presented in several large volumes which cover the Eastern Shore,
Western Shore, Piedmont, and Western Maryland (Wesler et al. 1981).
In research on two creek drainages in Prince William County,
Virginia, William Barse (1982) surveyed portions of the Inner
Coastal Plain, Piedmont uplands and lowlands, and the edge of the
Blue Ridge. Much earlier, Gerard Fowke (1894) reported on
investigation in both the James and Potomac valleys. Edward
Larrabee (1963) reports occasional surveys by Richard Slattery
along the Potomac in the 1930s and 1940s. Syntheses of data such
as the compilation of distribution information on fluted points
throughout eastern North America (Brennan 1982) are relatively
rare, but provide a broad spatial perspective on land use.

Following is a chronological listing of some of the major
professional survey within or adjacent to the Potomac Basin by
physiographic region. Many small surveys, particularly those which
have been undertaken for Section 106 compliance are not listed
here. Work that has been undertaken in the units of the National
Park Service within the National Capital Region is addressed in
Part III of this plan: Status of Archeological Inventory. Results

Coastal Plain. Francine Bromberg (1987) provides a useful
overview of research in the Coastal Plain and Fall Zone (see, for
example, Table II.10). MacCord (1957) summarizes both professional
and amateur work in the Anacostia Valley, where collecting began at
least as early as the 1870s.

Archeological work in the Coastal Plain began well over a century
ago. The Potomac was of national archeological interest in the
late 19th century; not the least reason was the attention of the
most prominent archeologist in the country, William Henry Holmes.
A symposium publication in the 1889 volume of American
Anthropologist included articles on shell middens, villages and
workshops in the District of Columbia, and pottery of the Potomac.

During the 1890s William Dinwiddie, William Henry Holmes, and
Gerald Fowke conducted surveys in the area (Fowke 1894; Holmes
1897, 1903, 1907; Holmes et al. 1891). After Holmes’ work in the
region, however, there was very little professional attention until
T. Dale Stewart's excavations in the 1930s (Stewart 1939, 1940,
1941; Stewart and Wedel 1937). Richard Stearns (1943, 1949)
undertook some survey along the Patapsco in Maryland.

Shell middens have always intrigued archeologists. Elmer Reynolds
(188la, 1881b, 1889) wrote of the "shell heaps" of Popes Creek and
of the Potomac and Wicomico Rivers in the 1880s. Holmes added his
observations for shell middens in the Tidewater in 1907. Nearly
100 years later, Steven Wilke and Gail Thompson (1977) looked at
shell middens and other sites in Maryland and Waselkov (1982)
conducted extensive work on the White Oak Point site in Virginia.

There are several modern surveys which have provided systematically
collected data useful for reconstructing settlement and subsistence
patterns. Surveys conducted south of the Potomac Basin yield
important comparative data. Such work includes survey along the
Nottoway and Meherrin rivers (Binford 1964) and along the James,
York and Rappahannock rivers (Turner 1976). Stephen Potter's
(1982, 1993) survey of the Coan River on the Northern Neck of
Virginia, and surveys along the Patuxent by Barse (1988) and
Steponaitis (1980, 1983, 1986) are the most comprehensive in the
National Capital Area. In Virginia, Barse (1982) conducted a survey
of Neabsco and Powells creeks in Prince William county and Michael
Johnson has surveyed parts of Fairfax county. Henry Wright (1973)
surveyed a portion of the Severn River in Ann Arundel County,
Maryland in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Wanser's (1982) study
of collections from south central Maryland identified areas with
particularly high probability of site location.

The Virginia Department of Historic Resources initiated a study of
the settlements dating to the Virginia Company period 1607-1624 for
the 400th anniversary (Turner and Opperman 1993).

Piedmont. Data from the survey of the Monocacy River valley in
Maryland (Kavanaugh 1982, 1983) have been widely used for
reconstructing settlement in the Potomac Basin Piedmont throughout
human use of the area. In addition Joseph McNamara surveyed a
number of state-owned areas in Maryland during the 1970s: Gunpowder
Falls State Park (McNamara 1977a); Patapsco Valley State Park
(1977b); Seneca Creek State Park (1977c); and the Monocacy Natural
Resources Management Area (1978).

In the Virginia Piedmont, Cromwell and McIver (1985) surveyed
portions of Broad Run, Bull Run, and Quantico Creek in Prince
William County. There have been a number of recent surveys by the
University of Virginia of the inner Piedmont counties outside of
the Potomac Basin, including Albemarle (Hantman 1985), Buckingham
(Klatka et al. 1986), and Fluvanna (Klatka 1988). Archeological
resources in the Richmond area were surveyed by Mouer et al.
(1985a, 1985b) and in Henrico county (Mouer 1986; Mouer et al 1980;
Mouer and Ryder 1986). Survey along the James river was also
conducted (Mouer 1983, 1991la).

Appalachian Province. There have been several important surveys
in the various districts of the Appalachian Province. Work in caves
and rockshelters in Maryland is summarized by Tyler Bastian (1971).
In 1892 in the South Mountain area of Frederick and Washington
counties, Holmes (1897:73-77) attempted to locate rhyolite quarries
on valley's east side into Pennsylvania. Stewart (e.g., 1987) has
written a good deal on the exploitation of rhyolite. His
assessment (1983) is one of the few systematic considerations of
the settlement pattern of the Blue Ridge.

The Great Valley, called the Hagerstown Valley in Maryland and the
Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, has received extensive archeological
attention. Gardner's and his associates' work with the Flint Run
complex is particularly well known and widely used (e.g., Gardner
1974a, 1974b). Other portions of the Ridge and Valley province
were surveyed in the George Washington National Forest (Gardner and
Boyer 1978), in Shenandoah National Park (Inashima 1988), and in
Berkeley County, West Virginia (Carr and Gardner 1979). Gardner
(1986) has also synthesized his work in the Shenandoah Valley.
Portions of Loudoun County, Virginia have been surveyed and
predictive models for site location proposed (Ballweber 1988;
Haynes 1988; Rust 1986).

Fowke did some work in the Hagerstown Valley in 1891-1892 (Stewart
1980:69). Stewart (1981) collects information from nonsystematic

II. OVERVIEW: PREVIOUS SURVEY 169


=== Page 200 ===

observations to summarize what is known about prehistoric burial
mounds in the Hagerstown Valley. The data from Stewart's (1980)
dissertation work, a systematic survey of the Hagerstown Valley,
have provided the standard for reconstructing settlement in that
area.

In the upper Potomac in the Allegheny Plateau, Henry Wright's
(1959) and Robert Corliss's (1965; Corliss and Wright 1967) surveys
have provided important baseline data. More recent work by Wall
(1981) provides data from a systematic survey for prehistoric sites
of western Maryland's coal region in Garrett and part of Allegany
county. In the same area Kenneth Lacoste and Robert Wall (1989)
report on an archeological survey for historic resources.

Predictive Site Models

Archeological sites can be anywhere; they often are found in
unexpected places. Statistically, however, they are more likely to
be in certain environmental settings than in others. It is this
latter observation which fuels site predictive models. The former
observation stands as a caution against overreliance on such
models. Predictive site models rest on the assumption that there
are fairly regular patterns of human settlement for any particular
time period in a particular environment. These models begin with
a hypothesized pattern drawn from known site locations and
analogies with ethnographically-known societies. Confirmation is
then sought through site survey.

One of the products of archeological survey is a data base of site
locations which forms the basis for documenting the long-term use
of the landscape. A complete understanding of a society's
settlement pattern would include the variety and relationships
between sites of different functions occupied during different
seasons and the variations in these through time and across space.
It would also put the use of the landscape into a context of
social, political, economic, and ecological relationships both
within and between cultural groups.

Such a task is not accomplished easily and it has taken the work of
generations of archeologists to flesh out an understanding of this
topic. It is by no means complete.

Connected to the site identification goal of survey is a great deal
of effort expended to identify the most consistent predictors of
site location. Much of the impetus can be traced to the needs of
compliance-driven archeology to cut the cost of survey by
predicting where it is not necessary to look. Driven by this
purpose, site prediction becomes an insidious method to continue to
discover what we think we already know. However, a great deal of

Il. OVERVIEW: PREVIOUS SURVEY 170


=== Page 201 ===

data collected in the context of building predictive models has
contributed to models of human use of the landscape and has
enriched our understanding of that use. The challenge is to
continue to use these models as flexible and hypothetical baselines
rather than as fixed discoveries.

A “red flag model" may be useful in the management of sites.
Jeffrey Altschul (1990:227) writes that "what is needed are not
models predicting the unknown, but rather models that bring some
order and direction to . . . huge databases." He emphasizes that
for both land management and archeological needs, we need ways to
identify sites which do not fall within predicted locations. The
archeological value of such an approach is clear. He explains
(1990:227-8):
By highlighting sites located in areas where sites are
generally absent we can begin to explore portions of the
archaeological record that are presently unclear. Sites in
anomalous settings by definition must be the result of
behaviours that do not fit current models of why prehistoric
inhabitants settled where they did. Under any definition,
these sites must be significant, for they more than any others
have the potential of telling us something about prehistory
that was heretofore unknown.

Archeology is still in its infancy of anthropological understanding

of past human lives. Prediction of site location, pursued as a
self-contained goal, mistakenly implies a certain maturity to the
discipline. Site prediction is not the point; site discovery

leading to the interpretation of human lives in a regional context
is.

James Ebert (1992:46) makes this point forcefully:
Without knowing the systemic mechanisms behind the placement
of activities across the landscape -- that is, without knowing
about the articulation of systems components -- there can be
no generally applicable predictions.

Ebert is highly critical of predictive modeling, which is, he
believes, rooted in present expectations. He writes (1992:72),
“Even if predictive modeling is possible, it is simplistic. It
cannot help but be unsatisfactory in explanatory terms and should
not occupy much of our time or energy."

The careful assessment of microenvironment necessitated by
increasingly detailed site predictive models does, however, occupy
our time and is worth our effort as it contributes to our
understanding of the human use of the landscape.

Much of the focus on locational predictive models is on features in

the physical environment. Clearly, social factors influence where
people live and how they move across the landscape. On a regional

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 171


=== Page 202 ===

scale, it is more common to extract hypotheses about social
relationships from settlement pattern than to propose models of
settlement based on social needs.

Wall (1981:138) points out that environmental factors influencing
settlement pattern may be identified as physiographic, biotic, and
climatic. Climatic factors include such elements as the number of
frost-free days, seasonal temperature extremes, precipitation, and
sunlight exposure. Biotic factors include plant and animal
resources, seasonality, and paleoecological factors. Physiographic
factors include the topographic (degree of slope, local relief),

geologic (lithic raw resources, rockshelter formation, soil
fertility), and hydrologic (floodplain development, stream order,
surface water availability, river navigability, and stream
junctures). He is clearly most concerned with predictive models of
site location based on physiographic factors, although it is clear
that the others play crucial roles.

An example of an environmental characteristic influenced by several
factors is the relative amount of sunlight and shadow in a
particular location. Human decisions about the use of that spot
will be influenced by sunlight. Solar energy was a factor both
prehistorically and historically. A historic period farmstead, for
example, might have the farmhouse situated on the south Slope of a
relatively treeless hill to take advantage of solar heat and the
orchard on the north to take advantage of the cooler air (Mires
1993).

There are major challenges for predictive site models and for site
identification and description if survey information is to be
useful in constructing regional settlement models. One of these
challenges is that of refining prehistoric site typology,
particularly the terminology used in describing site function.
While terms such as base camp, hunting camp, foray camp, and the
like are used extensively in reporting the results of site survey,
they have not been adequately described, tested, or explained in
the literature (Hantman, personal communication).

Although there have are periodic attempts at rationalizing and
quantifying the characteristics of some site types there has been
little explicit attention to this problen. The informal
application of vague definitions damages efforts to more fully
describe, explain, or even ask new questions of regional
archeological data.

An additional important challenge for predictive models is to
adequately characterize the physical environment. Michael Klein
and Douglas Sanford (1995) point out that
Unfortunately, predictive models often include unwarranted
assumptions about the structure of the environment. For
example, many studies assume a normal distribution of

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 172


=== Page 203 ===

environmental variables within study areas. This assumption
implicitly lurks within an argument that the environmental
variables associated with site locations represent the
locational requirements of historic [and prehistoric] peoples,
rather than simply reflecting the structure of the local
environment.

Fortunately, with the technology currently available in Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), more sophisticated environmental
analyses are possible (e.g., Allen et al. 1990).

With the understanding that predictive modeling should be
approached with flexibility, I summarize some of the models that
have been created from survey data for the different physiographic
areas of the Potomac basin. Because the methods used for
predicting and analyzing site location differ greatly for
prehistoric and historic resources, predictive factors are
discussed separately here. Prehistoric factors are discussed
first.

Coastal Plain and Piedmont. Potter (1993) discusses some of the
factors influencing site location during the Late Woodland on
Virginia's Northern Neck and the Coastal Plain in general.
Synthesized from ethnohistoric observations, criteria for village
location included nearness to rivers, fresh water, topographic
rises, marshes, and good agricultural land (Potter 1993:28-29).
Villages near the Bay should be on broad necklands along smaller
estuaries. Due to a variety of factors, it is "unlikely that a
major Late Woodland or historic period village in the Chicacoan
locality would have been located along the Potomac River nearshore
environment" (Potter 1993:29).

Large Late Woodland Rappahannock Complex components on the Patuxent

River are associated with lowland terraces and estuarine settings

(Potter 1993:118). Soil type becomes critical as a site predictor

during Late Woodland II. Potter (1993:35) writes,
Three soil associations containing soils favorable to slash-
and-burn maize cultivation are found in the vicinity of the
general village locales in significantly higher proportions
relative to their overall distributions within the two-county
[Northumberland and Lancaster] area. These associations are
the Mattapex-Bertie, Matapeake-Mattapex, and Woodstown-
Dragston.

He continues, listing soil associations further up the river

(1993:39):
As one moves up the Potomac River, toward the fall line, the
soil associations and topography change . .. [but] probably
were chosen for slash-and-burn maize cultivation for the same
reasons. On the Virginia side of the river the Nansemond-
Tetotum-State, Tetotum-Bojac-Pamunkey, Tetotum-Bladen-Bertie,

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 173


=== Page 204 ===

Galestown-Sassafras-Woodstown, and Matapeake-Mattapex-
Woodstown soil associations would have been best. . .. In
Maryland soil associations like the Matapeake-Matapex-
Sassafras, Elkton-Othello-Keyport, Sassafras-Keyport-Elkton,
and Collington-Matapeake-Galestown would probably have been
most favorable. ..

In an extensive review of known sites in the Inner and Outer
Coastal Plain and Piedmont Uplands of Virginia, Bromberg (1987)
classifies sites as follows: base camp, macrosocial unit basecamp,
microsocial unit basecamp, exploitative foray camp, quarry-related,
isolated find, lithic scatter. She collected information for 17
drainages in the Inner Coastal Plain, 2 in the Outer Coastal Plain
and 1 in the Piedmont.

Table II.11 below summarizes Bromberg's counts, averaging data
where necessary. Base camps include all types of base camps.
(Bromberg's counts and percentages are interpreted here without
knowledge of relative survey coverage between or within the
regions.)

In the Inner Coastal Plain 60% of the sites are on the
floodplain/terrace and 40% are upland. On the other hand, 86% of
the base camps are on the floodplain/terrace and only 14% are in
the upland. The 58 base camps are only 15% of the total number of
sites counted.

In the Outer Coastal Plain 80% of the sites are on the
floodplain/terrace. Nearly all of the base camps are here and base
camps make up 62% of known sites.

In the Piedmont uplands the percentages of floodplain/terrace to

upland sites is opposite that of the Coastal Plain. Base camps
make up a very small percentage (6%) of the known sites.

In her survey of Monocacy River region in the Piedmont lowland of
Maryland, Kavanagh (1982) identifies four geomorphological zones
based on topography, elevation, soil, and surface water. The
foothill zone includes a narrow strip adjacent to the mountain from
the slope of Catoctin Mountain to the top of the first ridge,
containing all colluvial and alluvial outwash soils. The River
zone includes the river terraces, floodplains and bluffs of the
Potomac and Monocacy rivers. The Piedmont zone includes the
uplands with rolling topography and highly dissected streams, is
higher than the valley, and has more shallow, excessively drained
soils. The Valley Floor zone has level topography, dendritic
G@rainage and well-drained soils. Kavanagh summarizes’ the
presence/absence of different site types in each of these four
zones as below.

Analysis of site predictive models finds that the following
landforms within the Coastal Plain and Piedmont are usually cited
as having a high probability for archeological sites in the general
Washington, DC area (Bellomo-McGee 1990:82):

1) terraces and floodplains along the Rappahannock and Potomac;
2) terraces adjacent to wetlands;

3) inner floodplains at the base of uplands;

4) interior ridges or terraces near interior wetlands;

5) middle reaches of larger creeks;

6) upland levels, between headwaters of at least two small (ist
erder) streams;

7) ridge tops along lst order streams, especially on the ends of
ridges oriented toward streams;

8) edges of low terraces where bottomlands develop, i.e., first
terraces within aggrading alluvial formations;

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS i75


=== Page 206 ===

From their analysis of site components and their geomorphological
positions, the authors of the Washington Bypass study conclude that
the following four factors are key to identifying areas of high
site probability: distance to water, soil association, slope, and
direct historical information (Bellomo-McGee 1990:88).

Appalachian Province: Blue Ridge. Paul Inashima (1986) summarizes
the occupation of prehistoric sites in the Shenandoah Blue Ridge.
Although there is no apparent occupation during the Paleoindian
period the mountains are regularly used during the Early and Middle
Archaic, as evidenced by small, low density sites. Several kinds
of sites with Late Archaic diagnostic artifacts include base camps
and ephemeral encampments such as crossover sites, bench sites, and
landmark stations. There is very little evidence of Early Woodland
occupation along the upper ridge but the Middle Woodland is well
represented. Late Woodland sites are sparse along the upper ridge
and occasionally extensive along the lower ridge. Extensive base
camps are present in the lower gaps.

Evidence of prehistoric use of the Maryland Blue Ridge, as
summarized by Stewart (1983), is similar in some ways to that
described by Inashima. No use is seen in Paleoindian phases or in
the Palmer phase of the Early Archaic but by the Kirk and Warren
phases there is substantial use of the mountains indicated by
isolated points, short term stations, small group hunting stations
and revisited stations. During the Middle Archaic metarhyolite
quarry/workshops are added to these site types. During the Late
Archaic the number of sites in upland settings above stream valleys
increased, as did settlement periodicity. Rhyolite processing
stations are added to the site type inventory. During the Early
Woodland there is an increase in forays into the Blue Ridge but
this intense use declined by the end of the Middle Woodland.

Appalachian Province: Great Valley and Ridge and Valley. Because
of the extensive work reported by Michael Stewart (1981), there is
detailed material available for the Great Valley. This work is
summarized here at some length.

In his survey work in the Great Valley of Maryland Stewart (1981)
identifies four geomorphological zones within the Hagerstown Valley
itself and two in the Ridge and Valley west of the valley. In the
valley these zones are 1) valley floor, 2) uplands of the valley
floor, 3) foothills, 4) foothills and mountains. To the west his
study included transects in the 1) valley floor and 2) foothill and
mountain.

Stewart (1980) offers a model for site types and locations per
cultural time period for the Ridge and Valley province. Table II.12

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 176


=== Page 207 ===

presents much of this information, listing functional site types
followed by their location per time period.

Generally, Paleoindian sites are found “within the valley systems
of relatively high order streams with the presence/absence of
suitable lithic materials being a limiting factor" (Stewart
1980:105). Hunting camps and individual hunting stations are also
on low order streams. In floodplains sites are “located on older
terraces, alluvial fans, and around backwater swamps, marshes, or
floodchute areas, many of which may be buried beneath more recently
deposited sediments."

During the Early Archaic (8,000-6,500 BCE) sites are of the same
types and are found in the same settings but also in a wider range
of settings. New areas included
terrace positions in relatively broad lower order streams
(e.g. third order) and portions of some high order stream
floodplains that were more or less newly created by changes in
stream morphology attendant upon various climatic and
environmental changes [Stewart 1980:108).

There is a change in settlement pattern with the Middle Archaic
(6,500-3,000 BCE) which, for the most part, continues into the Late
Archaic (3,000-1,000 BCE). Early Woodland (1,000-300 BCE) and
Middle Woodland (500 BCE - 900 CE) patterns are essentially the
same as Late Archaic. However, there is the addition of burial
cairns as a site type. Site predictors for burial mounds are
recreated from reports of mounds and mound groups. [In the Great
Valley those recorded are always associated with high order
streams, specifically the Potomac, Antietam, or Conochogue. They
may be found on the floodplain or on high Pleistocene terraces or
bluffs. In the Shenandoah burial mounds occur in pairs or groups
in uplands (Stewart 1981).

Late Woodland sites are not found in the foothill and mountain
zones of Ridge and Valley province. In the Upper Potomac in the
Allegheny Plateau Monongahela sites may occur either in river
bottoms near the mouths of tributary streams or on the high hills
overlooking these areas (Stewart 1981).

Appalachian Province: Allegheny Plateau. Wall (1981:139ff)
identifies four geomorphological zones and a number of subzones in
the Allegheny Plateau:
These areas are
1) floodplain:
1) large floodplains,
2) isolated floodplains,
3) isolated floodplain at stream confluence,
4) floodplain swamp,
5) Pleistocene/Early Holocene Terraces, Alluvial fans and
relict terraces,
6) recent floodplains in wide valleys,
7) recent floodplain in V-shaped valleys,
8) floodplains of large tributary creeks;
2) foothills;
3) slopes:
1) slopes according to gradient, including areas that may
contain rockshelters,
2) benches;
4) uplands:
1) hilltops above major drainages,
2) hilltops above minor drainages,
3) minor ridges,
4) major ridges,
5) saddles,
6) headwater flats,
7) upland swamps,

It is clear that the more finely the local environment is defined,
the more detailed may be the description of changing locational
preferences and economic choices. The key factors for site
location identified in Wall's (1981) survey in western Maryland
were 1) surface water setting, 2) relief, 3) surface character,
that is levelness and presence of spring(s), 4) available lithic
resources, and 5) soils.

Summary of Prehistoric Predictive Factors. Gardner (e.g., 1982)
probably has been the single most influential archaeologist in
modeling prehistoric site distribution in the mid-Atlantic states,
particularly in the Potomac basin. Certain variables affecting
site distribution, generalized from studies in several
physiographic provinces, are cited as being more or less important
depending on the time period. These are the distribution of:

1) lithic raw material;

2) water;

3) game attracting habitats;

4) zones of maximum habitat overlap;

5) well-drained, low-relief topography;

6) higher order perennial streams and distance from them;

7) maximum sunlight exposure;

TI. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 180


=== Page 211 ===

8) maximum extent of easily tillable arable land (Gardner 1987;
Gardner and Boyer 1978).

Stewart (1980) omits Gardner's third factor, the distribution of
game attracting habitats, presumably because it is redundant with
the fourth. These factors are general. Only through understanding
the local setting can models be offered that are of localized
predictive and explanatory value (Stewart 1980:98; Gardner 1987).

Historic Period. Historic site prediction often involves looking
for indications of settlement on historic maps or tracking down
descriptions of locations in deeds or other historical documents.
Ecological factors are also considered. Different kinds of surveys
and predictive models may be necessary for different sorts of sites
and for sites of different time periods. Residential sites, for
example, will have different locational needs than industrial
sites. Nineteenth-century sites will be located in a very
different physical and social environment than l7th-century sites.

Not surprisingly, determinants of site location during the 17th
century in Maryland include access to good soil, fresh water, and
transportation routes as well as previously cleared land (e.g.,
Edwards and Brown 1993:288).

Craig Lukezic (1994:13) summarizes:
It is assumed that [colonists] placed themselves nearest to
the resources that they valued the most and/or used most
often. If one can identify and prioritize these resources or
factors, insights can be gained into the locational selection
strategy used by Tidewater colonial Virginians.

Lukezic (1994) emphasizes that the type of soil influences the
taste of tobacco and hence its marketability. He classifies prime
tobacco soils and recognizes soil type as a major locational factor
for mid to late 18th century sites. He found that prime tobacco
soils were the closest resource to known sites in 87% of 64 sites
and that drinking water was the closest for 10.9% of these
(1994:27).

Access to navigable water was an important factor in the 17th and
18th centuries (Smolek 1984; Smolek and Clark 1982) and land
transportation via roads was also more important than previously
assumed (O'Mara 1983; Lukezic 1994). Michael Smolek (1984)
enumerates some site location factors during the 17th century: soil
type, proximity to drinking water, and access to the waterfront.
Settlement sites correlate with prime soil and with both fresh and
navigable water.

Some researchers have attempted to identify factors which affect
different types of European land use. Potter and Waselkov (1994),

II. OVERVIEW: PREDICTIVE MODELS 181


=== Page 212 ===

for example, have investigated the location of early European
settlements on Virginia's Northern Neck and found that they are
strongly associated with earlier Algonquian sites. For various
reasons, European settlers placed their homesteads on depleted
agricultural fields and cultivated the rich soils that had been
Indian habitation sites.

In a study of mill placement in the Hagerstown Valley in Maryland
Susan Winter (1994b) considers not only environmental factors but
also the broader context of site location. She analyzes the
transformation in mill locational patterns as an effect of core-
periphery relations, and shifts in local and regional markets.

The emphasis of her study is on "correlating changes in mill
production with changes in transportation patterns and how these
reflected changes in the political economy" (1994b:68). Locational
information alone was found to be inadequate for understanding
regional economic change, but it is essential for documenting local
conditions.
Since mills were a fixed entity on the landscape involving
large investments of capital and thus not readily movable,
change in core-periphery relations are reflected in increases
or decreases in flour production at individual mills rather
than changes in physical location [Winter 1994b:67].

Environmental factors such as elevation, slope aspect, and soil
type affected the placement of 19th-century farmhouses and
farmstead outbuildings, fields, orchards, and pastures (Mires
1993). Although Peter Mires writes of the Green Mountains of
Vermont, his observations about 19th century use of solar energy
are widely applicable. He recommends (1993:89) that "aspect should
be included as an important component of any predictive model when
historic farmsteads are involved. Its importance in North America,
in fact, probably increases with latitude and local relief." For
this reason, aspect would be a locational factor in the Appalachian
province and parts of the Piedmont rather than in the low-relief
sections of the mid-Atlantic.

Lacoste and Wall (1989) identify various factors affecting land use

for the Maryland Coal region of the Allegheny Plateau. Their table
of factors is reproduced here as Table II.13.

ARCHEOLOGICAL ISSUES

Throughout this overview, research topics in need of archeological
study have been identified. Traditional archeological interests in
chronological control, subsistence, settlement pattern, and social
organization need to be further addressed for nearly all periods
throughout the Potomac Basin within frameworks of anthropological

and historical questions. Economy has been suggested as a
comprehensive framework for forming and addressing questions for
both the prehistoric and historical past. Specific research

issues, of course, will be formulated for each particular project.

There are several categories of issues, all of which are necessary

to address. In the technical category are issues of site
discovery, identification, and appropriate data collection
strategies. In the analytic category are issues such as

chronology, typology, floral and faunal analysis, and raw material
source analysis, An interpretation category includes such issues
as the creation of ethnographic and historical analogies and
models, hypotheses concerning the relationship of social strategies
to material culture patterning, and the meaning of style in
artifacts and the built environment. Finally, the category of
modern context considers the current cultural context of
archeological knowledge and includes issues of various biases
(e.g., ethno- and gender "centrisms") in defining appropriate
questions and answers.

The very definition of time periods and culture areas, while
essential for making sense out of all our disparate data and
analyses, is itself a methodological issue.

Within archeologically defined time periods and within a region

neither conformity nor consistency should be expected. Instead
there will be some degree of stability, some change, and some
variability. In a discussion relevant to all periods of mid-

Atlantic archaeology, Michael Nassaney and Charles Cobb (1991)
discuss these characteristics for the Late Woodland periods in the
mid-Continent. Stability, they argue, may be maintained by
sociopolitical, ecological, technological, and ideological
constraints. Descriptions of transformations must ask the question
of who benefits from the change. Documenting variability within
regions is difficult because so much archeological energy is
devoted to classification based on similarity. These authors
(1991:250) ask, "does variation in the archeological record
necessarily correspond with human behavioral variability?" and
insist that all three dimensions of variability normally considered
archeologically -- temporal, spatial, organizational -- are
significant and must be considered simultaneously.

In order to gain an emphasis on social dynamism and historical
context, archeologists need to "refocus our view of societies from

II. OVERVIEW: ISSUES 187


=== Page 218 ===

one of static, bounded entities toward a vision of more fluid, open
systems composed of individual actors capable of making their own
history" (Nassaney and Cobb 1991:254).

Two points made earlier in the overview are important to keep in
mind while defining issues and the broader orientation of
archeological research. The first, emphasized by Shott (1990) is
that the shortcoming with much research is not the data but the
interpretation: archeologists should be reconstructing social
context rather than merely diet. Related to this complaint about
the often reductionist approach taken to the archeological past, is
the more general statement by Tankersley and Isaac (1990c; Isaac
1990) that by confounding ecology and environment, we tend to think
in terms of behavior rather than culture.

Elizabeth Brumfiel (1992) offers a powerful critique of the
limitations of cultural ecology school of interpretation in a
recent article entitled, "Distinguished Lecture in Archeology:
Breaking and Entering the Ecosystem -- Gender, Class, and Faction
Steal the Show." She emphasizes the need to consider social
motivation and incorporate it into our models and hypotheses. To
gender, class, and political faction can be added race, ethnicity,
occupational guild, and other social categories appropriate to
whatever historical context is under study.

The development of inequality and mechanisms for sustaining or
overcoming it are vital for understanding social relationships.
Nassaney and Cobb (1991:x) summarize the problem, “In societies
that are generally agreed to lack social classes, how does unequal
access to resources come about and what kinds of conflicts propel
social change?"

Because it is increasingly clear that social inequality is not
limited to agricultural societies and states, it is important to
create some ways to understand this phenomenon in hunter-gatherer
societies. Jeanne Arnold (1995) studies marginalization, or the
creation of powerlessness, in this context. She develops a
political model wherein emerging leaders create marginality through
the control over resources, production, reproduction, information,
and technology. Three scales of social, political, and economic
separation from power are the marginalization of 1) specialists
within groups; 2) classes of Jlandless laborers or whole
communities; 3) ethnic groups via conflict or conquest. With data
from the Northwest Coast, she supports a model of greater
inequality within communities than between them, and joins a number
of scholars who emphasize political motivation in the rise of
social inequality rather than attributing it to a passive and
natural development. Such interpretations may provide appropriate
analogies with which to explore the Late Archaic through Woodland
Potomac Basin, as the Northwest Coast has been suggested by local
researchers as a source of hypotheses,

Ii. OVERVIEW: ISSUES 188

General issues of archeological importance in the Potomac Basin are
those identified for the broader region and have been identified in
planning documents for Maryland and Virginia.

The Virginia Department of Historic Resources (1991) has developed
a priority list for archeological investigations in the state. The
questions implied are not limited to Virginia. These are:

1. Virginia and the Settling of the Americas: Native American
Colonization and Adaptations to a Changing Environment, 9500-
8000 B.C.

2. Adaptations of Hunting and Gathering Societies in a
Temperate Environment: Virginia from Estuary to Mountain,
9500 B.C. - A.D. 900.

3. The Origins of Agriculture and Sedentary Life: Virginia
From Estuary to Mountain, 3000 B.C. - A.D. 1607.

4. The Evolution of Native American Chiefdoms in Virginia.
A.D. 900 — 1607.

5. Native and American and European Interactions in the New
World: Effects in Virginia During the Sixteenth Through
Eighteenth Centuries.

6. Virginia During the Seventeenth Century as the First
Permanent English Settlement in the Americas.

7. The American Plantation System: Its Growth and Development
in Virginia. 1607-1865.

8. English Westward Expansion into the Interior of North
America: The Role of Virginia During the Seventeenth and
Eighteenth Centuries.

9. Virginia as a National Leader During the American
Revolution and Early Federal Period: From Battlefields to
Presidents, 1781 - 1830.

10. A Nation Divided: Virginia and the Civil War, 1861-1865.

The specific themes suggested by the Department for developing
contexts for all time periods are the following:

II.

1. Domestic

2. Subsistence/Agriculture
3. Government/Law/Political
4. Health Care/Medicine

5. Education

6. Military/Defense

7. Religion

8. Social

13. Landscape

14. Funerary

15. Ethnic/Immigration

16. Settlement Patterns

17. Architecture/Landscape Architecture/Community Planning
18. Technology/Engineering

19. Other

Maryland (Maryland Historical Trust 1986) offers separate themes
for prehistoric and historic periods. These are the following.
Prehistoric Period themes:
1. Subsistence
2. Settlement
3. Political
4. Demographic
5. Religion
6. Technology
7. Environmental Adaptation
Historic Period Themes:
1. Agriculture
2. Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Community Planning
3. Economic (Commercial and Industrial)
4. Government/Law
5. Military
6. Religion
7. Social/Education/Cultural
8. Transportation

The District of Columbia's Preservation Plan (DCHPD 1991) contains
specific themes as well. These are listed in the chronological
overview above (see archeological themes for the historic period).

National and regional research goals identified by local
archeologists for the historic period (Little 1988) include 1) the
anthropology of war, 2) race and ethnic relations among Europeans,
Native Americans, and African Americans from the 17th through the
20th centuries, and 3) urban, rural and hinterland economic
adaptation, including life on plantations.

Grumet (1992:289-319) uses the National Historic Landmark thematic
framework to define research needs and questions. These issues are
quoted below.

Following are some examples of archeological issues under the
above-mentioned categories. These lists are neither exhaustive nor
complete. Archeological issues, whether pertaining to prehistoric
or historic time periods, are flexible.

¢ site definition:

@ Adequate debitage recovery:

Kalin (1981), for example, is concerned that relatively little
stone working debris is recovered. His experiments (1981;134)
“show that the majority of diagnostic material lay within the
1/16 in. grid and that as much as 98% to 100% of the
recoverable material was lost by sifting with the 1/4 in.
screen commonly utilized in archaeological field work today."
He suggests flotation or finer mesh screen to recover this
material.

@ Adequate data recovery for subsistence:

Barber (1991:255-256), for example, makes specific suggestions

to aid in the analysis of subsistence practices:
1. More extensive use of wet screening and flotation
techniques in order to recover a better representation of
seed remains, phytoliths, and charcoal for dating.
2. More refined, multiseasonal excavations where detailed
research designs can be examined.
3. More and better excavation of inundated sites which
reflect the changing utilization systems accompanying sea
level rise.
4. More large-scale, multiseason excavation on known large
village sites.
5. More large-scale excavation on known Archaic sites.
6. More extensive gathering of pollen data across the state
in order to better map paleoenvironment through time.
7. An increased focus on interior sites, away from major
valley system, in order to understand broader settlement
and utilization systems.

Blood residue analysis needs continued refinement.

Examples of Analytic Issues
@ full use of interdisciplinary sciences

@ site formation and effects of natural processes on sites:
interpreting deflated sites;

II. OVERVIEW: ISSUES 192

@ improved chronological control:

¢ contemporaneity problem in settlement pattern analysis:

Variability in occupation must be estimated in order to
address the fact that the archeologically defined settlement
pattern of any period is not equal to the actual use of the
landscape by people (Dewar 1991).

@ Lithic analysis:

Henry and Odell (1989:ix-x) identify three major topics in

their collection of studies on lithic analysis. These are:
(1) distinguishing between function and ethnicity as the
forces governing patterned variability within artifact
assemblages, (2) recognizing reduction strategies through
quantitative techniques and linking these to systems of
economy and settlement, and (3) detecting and interpreting
of inter- and intra-site artifact patterning over a broad
front of integrated lithic analyses (e.g., wear pattern,
technologic, typologic, raw material usage).

use of flakes rather than formal "points" as projectile points
(Odell 1988);

use-wear analysis on tools and debitage and controlled
experimentation;

identification of curated and expedient tools;
use and curation of exotic and local materials;
reuse and remanufacture of lithic tools;

sourcing studies of raw materials to track trading networks

@ Ceramic analysis:

relationship between pottery technology (e.g., temper, wall
thickness) and cooking practices, food selection (e.g., Braun
1987)

@ Predictive Modeling:

II.

More systematic work is needed to understand settlement
systems and the ecological settings of different functional
site types.

Questions need to be directed toward those sites which fall
outside of predictive models.

Examples of Interpretative Issues

# relationship between ceramics and culture change:
Egloff (1991:248), for example, identifies one of the main
archeological issues concerning the impact of ceramics: Did
the incorporation of pottery bring any developmental change in
the cultural system of societies? The new technology would
require new strategies and labor organization for procurement,
manufacture and use, and supporting social organization.

III. STATUS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INVENTORY

For most parks in the National Capital Area the status and adequacy
of archeology is poor. One park and some sections of others have
a formal Overview and Assessment. Site forms are incomplete. The
only historical base maps for archeological resources or surveys
for the region as a whole was created in 1963 and therefore is
missing not only many known sites, but also whole park units.

There is locational information in paper files for all recorded
sites in the National Capital Area, although it is clear that many
sites known on park land have not been recorded with the
appropriate state or district repository. In most cases site
locations are marked on USGS maps. There is not yet a coherent GIS
data base of archeological sites in the region. Setting up such a
data base, with appropriate security measures to protect locational
information, should be a priority of each park.

Table III.1 summarizes data for the status of inventory and
documentation for each park. Column 1 lists Overview and
Assessments and other substantial survey documents. Column 2 notes
the date of the most recent Resource Management Plan (RMP). Column
3 indicates the approximate number of known sites in the park. The
vast majority of these are not recorded to current standards.
Column 4 indicates whether there is some kind of site form on file.
These site forms are nearly always missing vital information.
Column 5 indicates whether there are submerged archeological
resources within park boundaries. Only in the C&O Canal NHP are
submerged resources in waters owned by the park. Column 6 indicates
special concerns. Looting by relic hunters is a particular concern
in all of the Civil War parks and in nearly all other parks as
well. Many parks lack clearly marked boundaries, a situation which
adds to the problem of effectively prosecuting cases under the
Archeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA). The final column
notes the National Register status of each park and sites within
each park.

Of the approximately 78,000 acres in the National Capital Area
parks, about 6% has been inventoried at a sufficient level of
intensity that further systematic inventory is not necessary (given
current standards). Approximately another 11% has been inventoried
by less than full-coverage and requires further inventory to meet
current standards.

Table III.2. indicates the status of archeological collections as
of October 1994. The collections for most parks are stored at MARS
in Lanham, Maryland. Catalog status varies, but many of the
collections are catalogued in ANCS.

In some cases documentation indicates that there has been survey in
a park or portion of a park. However, in many cases the survey was

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY 199


=== Page 230 ===

done decades ago or was done in such a cursory manner that resurvey
is necessary. For example, the survey of the C & O Canal done over
thirty years ago (Larrabee 1963) was largely a literature search of
large prehistoric sites only and included very little field work.
Many early archeological surveys did not consider historical period
resources.

Much of the archeological work in the parks has been done as
compliance in advance of construction rather than as planned
research. There is some archeological information, however, for
nearly every park in spite of the fact that less than 10% of the
acreage has been systematically surveyed.

A brief synopsis for each park is provided in the following pages.
The sources for much of the information on the parks are the
Statement for Management (SFM) and Resource Management Plan (RMP)
for each park. Sample issues for archeological research also are
noted. Site forms and information are on file in the office of the
archeologist at the System Support Office for the National Capital
Area.

Tables III.3 through III.15 provide a chronological listing of
archeological work in each park. Included are identification and

evaluation studies and data recovery projects. Some small
compliance projects, recorded in memo reports, are not included;
neither are monitoring projects. A record of these small scale

archeological services may be found in each park's files and in the
office of the archeologist at the System Support Office for the
National Capital Area. The section of this plan entitled "Reports
on File, by Park" should also be consulted for park information.

ANTI - ANTIETAM NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD

The themes for which Antietam National Battlefield is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are the Battle of
Antietam and the Period of Commemoration of the Battle. In
addition there are landscape, architectural, and archeological
remains of the rural community around Sharpsburg dating from the
18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Prehistoric use of the land is
poorly documented in a few finds as the property had never been
systematically surveyed for archeological resources until the
project which began in FY94.

The commemoration of Antietam began soon after the battle and in
1867 the national cemetery was dedicated. Antietam National
Battlefield site was established in 1890. In 1960, Congress
mandated that the National Park Service is “to provide for the
maintenance of the site...in, or its restoration to, substantially
the condition in which it was at the time of the battle" (P.L. 86-
438).

The park is easily accessible by road and is within 70 miles of
both Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland. Its rural location in
Washington County, Maryland is just east of Sharpsburg. The
recorded visitor use of approximately 150,000 per year is expected
to continue to grow.

Three miles of Antietam creek and its 100-year floodplain run
through the park. There are a handful of wetlands within the park
boundary. All of the park lies within the Great Valley
physiographic province.

There are several historic buildings which survive from the time of
the battle. The commemorative landscape of the 1890s includes
monuments, roads, and memorial tablets. Associated with the
commemoration period is the memorial avenue of trees from
Sharpsburg train station into town where veterans marched on annual
trips to cemetery.

There were several farmsteads, some of which partially survive, and
at least one mill at the time of the battle and during the
commemoration period. In addition is the documented site of the
early 19th-century health resort known as Belinda Springs and the
later Belinda Springs hotel, It is likely that archeological
remains of these properties exist. Research is required to locate
and describe the contributing farmsteads and other features which
made up the battlefield.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park,

There are only three prehistoric sites recorded in the Maryland
state site files within the boundaries of Antietam NB. None of
these are well documented. There is a study, however, of
prehistoric site distribution in the Hagerstown Valley (Stewart
1980). Archeological issues in Antietam NB might include the
intermittent use of the area for hunting and gathering in proximity
to base camps closer to Antietam Creek.

Antietam National Battlefield lies within Washington County in
Western Maryland. The first settlement of Euro-Americans in the
county occurred around 1730 and by the later part of that decade
there was a grist mill on Antietam Creek. By the second half of
the 18th century there was major thrust of immigration into the
area by Pennsylvania-German and German settlers. The earliest
known farm on the property of Antietam National Battlefield is what
is now known as the Piper Farm, established as early as the 1740s.
Several farms were established through the 18th and 19th century.
At the time of the battle there were a number of family farmsteads
in operation, including that of Piper, Mumma, Sherrick, D.Miller,
D. R. Miller, Otto, John Poffenberger, Joseph Poffenberger, Samuel
Poffenberger, Rohrer, Middlekauff, Morrison, George Line, Kennedy,
Roulette, Clipp, and Philip Pry. Also within the boundary of the
park are other smaller farms and farmhouses, the Dunkard Church,
mills, roads, bridges, fords, a toll house, and the early 19th-
century resort of Belinda Springs. Standing structures remaining
from the time of the battle include some of those at Miller, Piper,
Otto, Sherrick, and Pry farms.

The primary applicable historical themes contained in the Maryland
Historical Trust's 1986 "Maryland Comprehensive Historic
Preservation Plan" are Agricultural and Military. Research within
these could be quite broad and other themes are possible. An
example of exploring the Agricultural theme would be a community
study through historical archeology of the rural community around
Sharpsburg, Maryland. General questions might include the
following: What was the community at the time of the battle of
Antietam? How did it develop? What changes occurred in and around
the community after the battle and after the war? For example,
what were the effects on the community of the battle, the war, the
creation of the National Cemetery, the commemorative landscape and
the touring of veterans and others, and the establishment of the
National Battlefield?

Archeology also may contribute information to the history of the
battle. In general, the physical evidence recovered by archeology

may provide new data on troop positions and movements, on landscape
features which may have affected the battle action, and on the life
of the soldier in camps as well as on the battlefield.

MONO - MONOCACY NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD

Monocacy National Battlefield currently is administered under the
superintendency of Antietam National Battlefield. Congress created
Monocacy National Military Park in 1934 and in 1976 authorized the
acquisition of land for the newly named Monocacy National
Battlefield. The park is easily accessible by road and neighbors
the growing city of Frederick, Maryland. Washington, D.C. is
approximately 45 miles to the south and Baltimore, Maryland is
approximately 45 miles to the east.

Monocacy NB is in the Piedmont and contains floodplain of the
Monocacy River as well as Bush Creek and several small tributaries.
There are several historic farms as well as roads, the B&O
Railroad, and battle features such as rifle trenches and blockhouse
foundations within park boundaries. Prehistoric use of the land is
documented in a few sites and the probability of more extensive use
is high, particularly along the Monocacy and its tributaries.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

There is a study of prehistoric site distribution in the Piedmont
(Kavanagh 1982). This work provides good baseline data for
predicting the kinds of sites in Monocacy NB. A range of
occupations from Paleoindian to Late Woodland times is likely. The
Woodland occupations on the floodplain of the Monocacy may yield
important information on agriculture and on the use of the Piedmont
after a cultural boundary developed along the Fall Line,

The primary applicable historical themes contained in the Maryland
Historical Trust's 1986 "Maryland Comprehensive Historic
Preservation Plan" are Agricultural and Military. Research within
these could be quite broad and other themes are possible. An
example of exploring the Agricultural theme would be a community
study through historical archeology of the rural community of
Frederick, Maryland. Such a study could include a comparison with
a similar one for Antietam NB and the community of Sharpsburg.
General questions might include the following: What was the
community at the time of the battle? How did it develop? What
changes occurred in and around the community after the battle and
after the war? For example, what were the effects on the community
of the battle, the war, and particularly the extensive need for
medical and convalescent services,

Historically a great variety of ethnicities -- Polish, Irish,

German, Scandinavian, African, French and others -- are recorded
for the farmsteads within the boundaries of Monocacy NB.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /MONO 214


=== Page 245 ===

Therefore, the comparison between ethnic households within a
community before, during, and after the battle could be made.

Archeology also may contribute information to the history of the
battle on either National Battlefield. In general, the physical
evidence recovered by archeology may provide new data on troop
positions and movements, on landscape features which may have
affected the battle action, and on the life of the soldier in camps
as well as on the battlefield.

CATO - CATOCTIN MOUNTAIN PARK

There is no specific legislation which establishes Catoctin
Mountain Park as a National Park. The land is owned by the
National Park Service and administered for recreation and
conservation. Federal ownership originated with the National
Industrial Recovery Act of 1933. The National Park Service
received the heavily eroded and deforested land in 1936 to
rehabilitate with WPA labor as the Catoctin Recreational
Demonstration Area. The original intent was to give the land to
the state of Maryland after the land was reforested and
rehabilitated. However, in 1945 Truman decided to retain the land
under the National Park Service. In 1954 the State of Maryland
received the southern half of the park, which is now Cunningham
Falls State Park, and the Demonstration Area became Catoctin
Mountain Park.

With the exception of Camp David, the Presidential Retreat, and the
Naval Support Facility, the park is accessible to the public by
road and trail. Most of the rurally located park is in Frederick
County, Maryland and a small portion is in Washington County. The
park borders the western edge of Thurmont. The town of Foxville is
also nearby. Park visitor use has increased since U.S. Route 15 was
expanded in the late 1970s.

Catoctin Mountain Park lies in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is 95%
forest covered and is drained by Big Hunting Creek and Owens Creek.

Stewart's (1981) survey of the Great Valley and adjacent Ridge and
Valley and his overview of the Blue Ridge are important
archeological references for this area. There are a few recorded
prehistoric rockshelters and more are expected, given the steep
topography with exposed cliffs and rock faces. The Blue Ridge
contains lithic resources such as rhyolite which were important to
prehistoric people, particularly during the Archaic period, for
both trade and their own use. Isolated finds and lithic scatters
are the most typical prehistoric sites known in the park.
Extensive erosion from timbering and charcoaling probably has
deflated many of the prehistoric sites on the mountain.

Nearby the park, an archeological survey was done at Catoctin
Furnace and Cunningham Falls in Frederick County (Milner 1981).

The Cabin Camp facilities at Misty Mount, Greentop, and Round
Meadow and the Country Store and Blacksmith shop at Round Meadow
are the major built resources. In addition there are abandoned
farmsteads, stills, collier pits and charcoal hearths, and other
sites associated with historical use of the mountain since the mid-
18th century.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

One of the prehistoric research questions which could be addressed
concerns the use of the mountain for the rhyolite trade. Questions
include, was the trade controlled by local groups or did many
peoples have access to the resources? How did the local use of the
mountain change when the regional rhyolite trade decreased in
volume?

One example of exploring the historical period economic life of the
mountain would be to examine the rural industry associated with the
iron furnaces and the changes in families' strategies as that form
of livelihood declined. Archeological evidence could contribute
data to understanding the changing relationship of the mountain to
the economy of the rest of the state as industry was removed from
rural areas. Prosperity and poverty and changing market
relationships are often discernible in the comparisons of consumer
objects recovered archeologically.

CHOH - C & O CANAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK

C & O Canal Historical Park was established in 1971 by the
"Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Development Act"(PL 91-664)

to preserve and interpret the historic and scenic features of
the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and to develop the potential of
the canal for public recreation, including such restoration as
may be needed, ... in the states of Maryland and West Virginia
and in the District of Columbia.

The park, which averages only hundreds of feet wide, runs for
nearly 185 miles from the mouth of Rock Creek in Georgetown to
Cumberland, Maryland paralleling the Potomac River.

Most of the park's land is in Maryland. Five miles are in the
District of Columbia and there are four small portions in Morgan
and Mineral counties, West Virginia. Maryland counties though
which the park runs are: Montgomery (37 mi), Frederick (16 mi),
Washington (78.5 mi), and Allegany (48 mi).

Accessibility to the park varies. Surroundings vary from urban in
the lower part to remote in the interior, northern sections. As a
whole, however, the park is quite accessible along its entire
length. For example, numerous roads intersect or parallel the
park: 1-495 crosses near Great Fall; I-81 crosses near
Williamsport; four federal and Maryland highways cross the canal;
40 county roads (some unpaved) provide access at regular intervals;
the Clara Barton parkway and MacArthur Boulevard are adjacent or
nearby between DC and Great Falls; MD 51 is adjacent or near from
North Branch to Spring Gap near Cumberland.

Estimated visitor use is two million annually; 75% of the
visitation occurs in the lower 20 miles.

The Canal is unique among parks in the National Capital Region in
that it passes through all of the physiographic provinces in the
region. The first mile is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and the
next 60 are in the Piedmont Plateau. The Blue Ridge contains 63
miles from Harpers Ferry water gap through Great Valley to Hancock.
From Hancock to Cumberland, 60.5 miles run through the Ridge and
Valley province.

Environment is mostly floodplain with 2nd and 3rd growth eastern
bottomland forest; there is some upland and some swamp. Eighty-
five percent of the park is in the 50-year floodplain of the
Potomac River.

The physical remains of the canal include the canal bed, towpath,
11 aqueducts, dams, 162 original historic culverts, 50 locks above
Seneca, 26 of original 57 locktenders houses (lockhouses) and
associated structures (600 features).

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /CHOH 218


=== Page 249 ===

There are also mills, bridges, houses, and foundations. Associated
towns include Seneca, Brunswick, Williamsport, Hancock, Little
Orleans, and Oldtown.

There are numerous known sites in the park even though the vast
majority of it has never been systematically surveyed. A great
deal of avocational activity before the establishment of the park
resulted in the recordation of many sites. The potential for both
prehistoric and historic sites is very high.

There was a systematic survey of approximately 100 acres of the
Oldtown locality (Handsman 1977). There is an Overview and
Assessment of Georgetown (Artemel et al. 1987).

Particularly important sites which have been investigated are the
Moore Village site (Pousson 1983), the Paw Paw site (Kavanagh 1984;
Curry 1983), the Winslow site (Slattery 1975; Tidwell 1975), and
the Monocacy site (Ayers et al. 1967). The Hughes site (Stearns
1940; Dent and Jirikowic 1990) is adjacent to park land and it is
likely that part of this site is on NPS property.

In addition, there has been archeological work on canal features
such as the investigation of walls (McGarry 1981), a dry dock
(Meltzer 1979), locks (Ziek 1979), culverts (Pousson 1977), and
lockhouses (Hsu 1975).

Several archeological studies have been done in Georgetown (Artemel
et al. 1985, 1987, 1991; Engineering Science 1985; Crowell et al.
1987). There has been a good deal of recent work at the western
end of the canal at Cumberland in connection with studies for the
Canal Parkway (Cheek et al. 1994; Helms et al. 1993; Sprinkle et
al. 1994; Uunila and Ebright 1993; Yamin et al 1993).

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

Every time period and nearly every theme listed in the Maryland
Preservation Plan (MHT 1986) is probably represented in
archeological resources in the C&O Canal park boundaries.
Therefore, there are myriad issues to be explored.

One prehistoric research topic is comparison of Late Woodland
settlement along the Potomac floodplain between physiographic
regions. A systematic comparison would shed light on the cultural
boundaries and interregional influences in the Potomac Basin during
a very complex time.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /CHOH 219


=== Page 250 ===

The C&O Canal contains sites critical to documenting the response
of Native American groups to European settlement through the 18th
century. Relatively little attention has been paid to the struggle
of Native Americans after the first several generations of contact.
Such neglect is due, at least in part, to the longstanding but
mistaken belief that Native Americans surviving after the mid-17th
century simply left the area (Cissna 1986). There is a great deal
of research to be done concerning ongoing contact and the creation
of syncretic cultures by various native groups. The Shawnee Old
Fields site in Allegany County is an important resource in this
regard. There are probably other sites with similar importance.

An additional historical period issue of particular relevance to
the canal and its operation is that of rural industry. The canal
permitted and demanded far-reaching economic changes along its
entire route. It encouraged settlement and provided direct links
with urban commercial and political centers to areas which had been
quite remote. The economic effects of the canal and of its demise
and the landscape effects of both the canal and the B&O Railroad
are important topics which may be partially addressed through
archeology.

GWMP - GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL PARKWAY

In 1924 the National Capital Park Commission was directed to
acquire land suitable for development into a National Capital park,
parkway, and playground system. The broad mandate given was to
"to prevent pollution of Rock Creek, and the Potomac and Anacostia
Rivers, to preserve forests and natural scenery in and about
Washington" (PL 202).

In 1930 the Capper-Cramton Act (46 Stat. 482) was passed to
establish the George Washington Memorial Parkway to protect and
preserve the natural scenery of the Gorge and Great Falls of the
Potomac and the historic Patowmack Canal. Three distinct roles are
defined in the park's Statement for Management:

1. preserve the Potomac shoreline from pollution and commercial
development;

2. provide for a variety of recreational needs of the Washington,
DC area

3. provide a scenic memorial roadway to the nation's capital and
the Mt. Vernon estate

The park is very accessible and is a major commuter route. It runs
along the Potomac River from Great Falls to Mount Vernon, Virginia
and from Chain Bridge to MacArthur Boulevard in Maryland and
encompasses island land as well. It is one of the most highly
visited units of the Natjonal Park System with an annual
recreational visitor count of 5 to 6 million.

The surrounding urban lands contain well-developed neighborhoods
and commercial centers in Fairfax and Arlington counties, Virginia;
Alexandria, Virginia; and Montgomery County, Maryland.

George Washington Memorial Parkway runs through both the Piedmont
and the Coastal Plain along the Potomac River. Parts of 16
tributaries are included in the Parkway boundaries. Between Great
Falls and T. Roosevelt Island the water flow changes from
waterfalls and cataracts in a tight gorge to a restricted channel
of rapid water with many islands, narrow rocky flood plains and
high bluffs. Below T. Roosevelt island the river opens onto the
Coastal Plain and comes under tidal effect, producing an estuary.

George Washington Memorial Parkway is an linear urban park made up
of many pieces. These include’ the following: Arlington House, Clara
Barton NHS, Glen Echo Park, Great Falls Park, T. Roosevelt Island,
L.B.J. Memorial Grove, Belle Haven, Daingerfield Island, Fort Hunt,
Fort Marcy, Gravelly Point, Roaches Run Wildlife Area, Mount Vernon
Memorial Highway, Riverside Park, Turkey Run Park and Claude Moore
Colonial Farm, U. S. Marine Corps War Memorial, Lady Bird Johnson
Park, Columbia Island, Jones Point Park and Lighthouse, Dyke Marsh
Wildlife Preserve, Langley Fork Park, Arlington Memorial Bridge
and Avenue, and the Netherlands Carillion.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /GwWMP 224


=== Page 255 ===

There are many important sites of interest to archeologists,
including Matildaville, which is an 18th and 19th century village
site at Great Falls, and Fort Marcy and several other Civil War
features.

Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, (ARHO) was the home of
Robert E. Lee from 1831, when he married Mary Anna Randolph Custis,
the daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, until 1861. In
1925 Congress voted to restore the home to its pre-war condition
and in 1955 Arlington house was designated as a permanent memorial
(PL 84-107). ARHO is located in Arlington, Virginia and is
surrounded by Arlington National Cemetery, which is administered by
the Army. The House is visited by approximately 400,000 - 500,000
persons per year.

Congress established the Clara Barton House (CBNHS) as a National
Historic Site in 1974 (93 Stat. 486) "to tell the early story of
the American Red Cross through the interpretation of the life and
times of its founder, Clara Barton."

Glen Echo Park is managed primarily to further cultural arts and
education, drawing on its beginnings as a National Chautauqua
Assembly site in 1891. Glen Echo Park was an amusement park from
1899 - 1967. Glen Echo is on the second of three terraces above
the Potomac River on the Maryland side. This position along the
Fall Line likely would have seen some prehistoric use and it is
possible that some resources survive. However, virtually all usable
land in the park has been modified by construction between 1890 and
the present.

Great Falls (GRFA), which receives approximately 500,000 visitors
per year, is situated on the Fall Line between the Piedmont and
Coastal Plain. After a drop of 76 feet the river flows into a
gorge, the upper three miles of which form the park's eastern
boundary. The park is heavily forested, mainly with secondary
growth on formerly tilled and clear-cut areas. Great Falls
contains the Potowmack Canal, developed by George Washington to
make the Potomac River navigable upstream from Georgetown. Three of
five locks, the canal prism, and many stone structures remain from
this one-mile long canal. The town of Matildaville was developed
by Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee along the canal. Several
structures in Matildaville have received some archeological
attention. These include: Samuel Briggs Grist Mill; Potts/Wilson
Iron Forge/Foundry; Springhouse; William Dickey House or Mrs.
Meyer's Tavern; Superintendent's House or Potowmack Company House;
and the Saw Mill.

T. Roosevelt Island (TRI) was established as a memorial to Teddy
Roosevelt and was incorporated into the National Capital Parks
system in 1932 (PL 72-146). The island is located in southwestern
Washington, DC in the Potomac River between Georgetown and Rosslyn,

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /GWMP 225


=== Page 256 ===

Virginia. It is managed primarily as a natural park for
recreation. Access to the is by trail and a pedestrian bridge. The
physical environment is that of a deciduous forest, including swamp
and marsh habitat along eastern edge of island. The location and
natural resources of the island make the likelihood of prehistoric
occupation very high and there are recorded sites on the island.
Both prehistoric and historic archeological resources are
documented. The Mason Family residence stood on the south end of
island and there are likely other historic uses as well.

Most of the known sites are from a few sources. A portion of the
Parkway has an Overview and Assessment (Cissna 1986). There were
early surveys by Smithsonian; compliance surveys at construction
locales (Inashima 1985) and survey along the shore line by Michael
Johnson of Fairfax County Heritage Resources Division. There is
very little information available for most of the sites but these
require phase II evaluation to judge their significance.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

One prehistoric research issue concerns the various uses to which
the Fall Zone was put, particularly during the Middle and Late
Woodland when the Fall Line came to mark a cultural boundary
between Siouan speakers on the Piedmont and Algonquian speakers on
the Coastal Plain,

It is worth noting that for south central Maryland, Wanser (1982)
identifies three areas with especially high likelihood of sites:
1) Zekiah Swamp, Gilbert Swamp, Allen's Fresh Wetland and adjacent
terrace uplands; 2) Popes Creek and Piccowaxen Creek coastal area
on the Potomac; and 3) St. Clements Bay and Breton Bay.

One historic period research issue concerns the European settlement
in the area before the establishment of the Federal city and the
changes in the economy as the capital grew through the 19th
century.

HAFE ~— HARPERS FERRY NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK

Harpers Ferry National Monument was established in 1944 (PL 78-386)
and was expanded through the addition of Storer College and the
John Brown Fort in 1960 (PL 86-655). The Monument became Harpers
Ferry National Historical Park in 1963 (PL 88-33).

The park is located at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac
rivers and contains land in three states: Jefferson County, West
Virginia (44% of park land), Loudoun County, Virginia (17% of park
land) and Washington County, Maryland (34% of park land).
Accessibility is variable; some is easily accessibly by vehicle and
other areas are accessible by trial.

Harpers Ferry lies in the Blue Ridge and Short Hill Mountains at
Harpers Ferry gap. Elevations range from 1448' asl at Maryland
Heights to 235' asl at the confluence of the rivers. The
floodplain area is subject to frequent, damaging floods.

The park contains several distinct areas. Lower Town, Virginius
Island and Hall Island are on the floodplain. Camp Hill is west of
Lower Town. Bolivar Heights and Elk Run are ridgetops. The
Shenandoah City area and Short Hill contain steep slopes and
shoreline. Loudoun Heights and Maryland Heights consist of
mountainous, forested land. Each of these areas has had different
historic and prehistoric uses.

Virginius Island was extensively developed for water-powered
industry in the 1820s. By 1859 there was an iron foundry, machine
shop, cotton mill, flour mill, sawmill, and carriage manufacturing
shop as well as workers' housing. The Shenandoah City area contains
part of the Potowmack Canal, ruins, old roads, and the B&O
Railroad.

This park has received a good deal of archeological attention and
has a rich archeological record of early industry and the domestic
response to it. The extensive flooding to which much of the land
has been subjected has deeply buried many parts of the
archeological record. It has also scoured some of it away.
Prehistoric occupation is still represented on the floodplain,
however, as evidenced by an occupation several feet under rich
historic deposits. The potential for prehistoric resources has not
been determined but may be moderate. The potential for historic
resources is demonstrated to be very high.

Archeological Issues
It is important for the reader to understand that research topics

are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /HAFE 230


=== Page 261 ===

One prehistoric issue is the seemingly limited use of the ridge
tops and mountains. Such use could be compared with the more
extensive use of the mountain resources in Catoctin Mountain Park.
There is a known prehistoric (Woodland) occupation which was
excavated in Lower Town (YoungRavenhorst 1994). Data from this
site provides information on trade between physiographic regions,
a topic which could be further explored.

A great many historical archeological issues have been explored in
Harpers Ferry (see, for example, Shackel 1993b,c; 1994a,b; Shackel
and Winter 1994). Landscape, industry, domestic responses to
industry, a changing craft ethos, boarding house behavior, health
and sanitation, Civil War commemoration, and the changing symbolism
of the John Brown Fort are some of the topics explored.

The importance of rural industry during the 19th century can hardly
be overestimated. The agrarian-industrial economy of the United
States before the Civil War was quite different than that which
developed afterwards. Industry concentrated in urban areas with
large, often immigrant, labor pools. Archeology helps to document
and interpret the development of the earlier industrial economy and
the changes that accompanied the shift.

Archeology also contributes information to the history of the Civil
War era use of park lands. In general, the physical evidence
recovered by archeological survey has provided data on
fortifications and campsites on both Maryland and Loudoun Heights.

Archeology can provide insight into the use of the landscape and on
the life of the soldier in camps (e.g., Winter 1994a).

MANA ~ MANASSAS NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD PARK

Manassas National Battlefield Park was designated a national
historic site in 1940. Congress established boundaries "to preserve
the most important historical lands relating to the two battles of
Manassas."

Situated 25 miles southwest of Washington, DC and 5 miles north of
Manassas, Virginia, the park is easily accessible by road. It is
bisected by two major highways. The park gets between 600,000 to
800,000 visitors annually.

Manassas NBP is located in the Piedmont upland in both Fairfax and
Prince William counties. Gently rolling hills are interspersed by
small, relatively steep stream valleys. The main drainage is Bull
Run along north and east boundaries; small feeder streams drain
the higher western ground. There are rock quarries north and east
of the park.

The areas of the historic scene of the battles include some
original houses, the partially reconstructed Stone Bridge, historic
road traces, the Unfinished Railroad, house sites, cemeteries,
trenches, earthworks, and monuments. There are significant 18th-
and 19th-century farm and plantation sites such as Pittsylvania and
Portici. Some of the most archeologically important resources are
those concerning African-American life both before and after the
war.

Archeological surveys in several areas of the battlefield have
demonstrated relatively high potential for both significant
historical and prehistoric sites. Nearly all of the recorded
prehistoric sites need further field work, as there is very little
information available.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

One possible prehistoric research issue is the development of a
context for lithic scatters, which are very common prehistoric
resources within the park boundaries. Lithic scatters are often
dismissed due to a lack of temporal diagnostics, but they
potentially hold valuable information on the use of the landscape.

Archeology may contribute information to the history of the

battles. In general, the physical evidence recovered by archeology
may provide new data on troop positions and movements, on landscape

Ili. STATUS OF INVENTORY /MANA 236


=== Page 267 ===

features which may have affected the battle action, and on the life
of the soldier in camps as well as on the battlefield.

Another issue of historical archeological interest concerns the
life of African-Americans before and after the battles and the
Civil War. An example of exploring this theme would be a community
study through historical archeology of the rural communities in the
area. General questions might include the following: What was the
community at the time of the battles? How did it develop? What
changes occurred in and around the community after the battles and
after the war?

NACC - NATIONAL CAPITAL PARKS - CENTRAL

There are numerous park units administered under National Capital
Parks - Central (NACC). At least 14 separate acts of Congress make
up the enabling legislation for these memorials and park areas.
The first was the Residence Act of 1790, which brought the Federal
City into being. The National Mall links the Washington Monument,
Lincoln Memorial and Jefferson Memorial as well as the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial. Other units include Ford's Theater Historic
Site, Constitution Gardens, Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic
Site, East and West Potomac Parks, and 150 small parcels of park
areas throughout the District of Columbia.

All of the units of NACC are urban and receive intensive visitor
use. The National Capital parks receive approximately 4 to 5
million visitors per year. These parks are within the Tidewater
Coastal Plain. A significant portion of the land has been created
through artificial means since the founding of the city.
Therefore, in some areas there is no potential for prehistoric
remains except those which were redeposited with imported soils.
In some other areas the ground surface which would have been used
prehistorically is so deeply buried by artificial means that
prehistoric archeological resources are, for practical purposes,
effectively protected (although inaccessible). On the other hand,
there may be areas which are neither disturbed nor deeply buried
and there is a high probability of historic period archeological
remains. As with most of the District of Columbia, the 19th and
20th centuries would predominate.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

Archeological research which would aid greatly in the assessment of
both prehistoric and historic resources is the documentation of
created land and land boundaries in existence before the
establishment of the Federal City. This project would involve
documenting areas of original shoreline and marshlands and
landforms before extensive landscaping during the 19th and 20th
centuries. John Pousson and Christine Hoepfner (1995) did such a
study for the White House grounds. It would be valuable to use GIS
technology to create such a data base.

NACE - NATIONAL CAPITAL PARKS - EAST

National Capital Parks East includes, in 96 separate land parcels:
Anacostia Park, Capitol Hill Parks, Fort Circle Parks, Fort
Washington, Frederick Douglass Home NHS, Harmony Hall, Kenilworth
Park and Aquatic Gardens, Oxon Cove/Oxon Hill Farm, Oxon Run
Parkway, Piscataway Park, Sewall-Belmont House, Suitland Parkway
and the recent additions of Greenbelt Park and the Baltimore-
Washington Parkway.

Several park areas were acquired under the Capper-Cramton Act of
1930 for the eventual construction of a parkway.

An act of June 6, 1924, amended Apr 30, 1926 (section 1)
established the need "to preserve the flow of water in Rock Creek,
to prevent pollution in the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, to
preserve forests and natural scenery in and about Washington."

The park parcels are urban and easily accessible. They are located
east of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. and in Prince Georges
and Charles Counties, Maryland.

Several major rivers and streams transect or border NACE lands,
These include the Potomac River, Anacostia River, Watts Branch,
Nash Branch, Oxon Run, Henson Creek, and Broad Creek. There is a
major wetland system in these Coastal Plain parks.

There are numerous built resources of many kinds. Archeological
potential varies considerably, from very high in Piscataway Park to
very low along Suitland Parkway.

Anacostia Park (ANAC)

The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1919
designated Anacostia Park as part of park system of the District.
It was to include: "the entire area reclaimed and to be reclaimed
from the mouth of the Anacostia River extending to the District
Line."

ANAC is managed as a community park for recreation use and open
space in the core of the city. It includes: Kenilworth Aquatic
Gardens, Kenilworth Park, Langston golf course, Anacostia Pavilion,
and facilities, and RFK stadium, Kingman Island Development, and
marinas.

Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens' swamp, marsh and open water are the
only remnants of the once extensive Anacostia River wetlands.
Kenilworth Park had been used as open-burning trash disposal and is
result of sanitary land-fill.

Fort Circle Parks (FOCE)

Forming the defenses for the Capital during the Civil War were 68
forts supported by 93 detached batteries, blockhouses, connected
rifle pits, and covered ways. FOCE preserves some of those
features, including: Fort Dupont, Fort Stanton, Fort Stevens,
Barnard Hill, Fort Bunker Hill, Fort Mahan, Fort Chaplin, Fort
Davis, Fort Totten, Battery Ricketts, Fort Carroll, Fort Greble,
and Fort Foote. Prior to the establishment of the National Capital
Planning Commission in 1942, the forts were owned by War
Department.

Fort Washington (FOWA)

In 1940, Fort Washington was transferred from the War Department to
the Department of Interior. The park was created to provide a
historic and aesthetically pleasing location for the southern end
of the Maryland portion of George Washington Memorial Parkway and
to preserve the historic coastal defense fortifications. Its use is
largely recreational.

FOWA is bounded on north by Swan Creek and on the south by
Piscataway creek. The land varies from small river flats to steep
hardwood forested slopes to level grassy areas.

The earliest fort on the site stood from 1808 to 1814. Fort
Washington was built between 1814-1824 with improvements in 1848.
Additional batteries were built between 1896 and 1903. In addition
to the fort are the remains of Diggs family mansion, built in 1729
and destroyed in 1819.

Frederick Douglass Home NHS (FRDO)

In 1962 Congress authorized the Secretary of [Interior "to
designate, for preservation as a part of the park system in the
Nation's Capital, the former home of Frederick Douglass" (PL 87-
633). Frederick Douglass owned the house and outbuildings from 1877
until his death in 1895. There have been several small
archeological projects carried out on this property.

Harmony Hall (HAHA)

Harmony Hall is located on low lying bottom and marsh lands along
Broad Creek which flows into Potomac River. Harmony Hall was built
during the late 17th or early 18th century. The ruins of 17th-
century Want Water structure and canal and at least one significant
prehistoric site along Broad Creek are within this unit's
boundaries. Archeological excavation was carried out in the
immediate vicinity of Harmony Hall.

Oxon Cove/Oxon Hill Farm (OXCO)

Oxon Cove is formed by the confluence of Oxon Run and the Potomac
River. The land varies from floodplain, to marsh and swamp, to high
river terraces with rolling hills created by sanitary landfill, to
forest. Oxon Run drains an extensively developed watershed. The
rich bottomland was farmed as a rehabilitation program for patients
at St. Elizabeth's hospital. There has been extensive alteration
to the landscape such as grading, landfill, and the building of a
golf course.

Oxon Run Parkway (OXRN)

The approximately 100 acres of the parkway contains forest,
wetlands, and floodplain. The wetland areas include the only
example in the National Park System of an Atlantic Coastal Plain
bog. It was part of the DC National Guard Facility Camp Simms.
Remains include Rifle ranges, fox holes, and other resources
associated with the Fort. Some of the associated toxic waste and
ordnance has been identified and removed.

Piscataway Park (PISC)

Piscataway Park is managed as a historic landscape. It was
established to ensure scenic and historic values for views from
Mount Vernon and Fort Washington (PL 87-362).

The older part of Piscataway Park hugs the shoreline of the Potomac
River at the mouth of Piscataway Creek. The development of 3000
acres above the shoreline is not owned in fee but is controlled
through scenic easement.

The area has been a semi-rural agricultural area but is
increasingly encroached upon by suburban development.

Piscataway park contains two distinct terraces separated by a steep
escarpment and drained by streams which have cut deep ravines
perpendicular to the shore. The land slopes upward from shore
evenly, forming a broad and level floodplain terrace. Marshes
predominate at stream mouths.

There are many documented archeological sites. Historic sites
include the Marshall Hall amusement park and Marshall Hall (c.
1690) and family cemetery. Prehistoric sites include many
significant sites including the Accokeek Creek site NHL.

Sewall-Belmont House (SEBE)

The Sewall-Belmont House was established as a National Historic
Site to interpret contribution of National Woman's Party in human
rights movement (PL 93-486). The site has been occupied since the

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /NACE 243


=== Page 274 ===

18th century. Sewall built house in 1800, incorporating an already
standing structure.

Suitland Parkway (SUIT)

Suitland Parkway is a limited access scenic parkway between Andrews
Air Force Base and the District. The land was acquired in 1942 by
the Army Corps of Engineers for a military highway. Grading,
drainage, and bridges were finished before it was transferred to
the National Park Service by Congress in 1949. Both Oxon Run and
Henson Creek cross under the parkway. Henson creek was widened
east of the Suitland Road culvert to relieve flooding in town of
Morningside.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

There are numerous archeological issues which could be addressed in
the various park parcels in National Capital Parks - East. One
important issue is the Native American adaptation to the presence
of Europeans and Africans and the nature of refuge communities as
Native Groups were affected by disease and warfare. Questions to
consider include: What groups coalesced in refuge communities?
How did Native groups interact with slaves and runaway slaves? How
did they interact with different classes or ethnic groups among
European-Americans?

Archeological research which would aid greatly in the assessment of
both prehistoric and historic resources is the documentation of
created land and land boundaries in existence before the
establishment of the Federal City. This project would involve
documenting areas of original shoreline and marshlands and
landforms before extensive landscaping during the 19th and 20th
centuries. Pousson and Hoepfner (1995) did such a study for the
White House grounds.

It is worth noting that for south central Maryland, Wanser (1982)
icentifies three areas with especially high likelihood of sites:
1) Zekiah Swamp, Gilbert Swamp, Allen's Fresh Wetland and adjacent
terrace uplands; 2) Popes Creek and Piccowaxen Creek coastal area
on the Potomac; and 3) St. Clements Bay and Breton Bay.

A variety of questions under a military theme also could be
addressed archeologically. There are resources from several
different periods. Archeology may contribute information on the
life of the soldier in camps and forts.

GREENBELT PARK AND BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON PARKWAY

There is no specific legislation which established Greenbelt as a
National Park. In 1950 lands were transferred from the Farm
Security Administration to the National Park Service for the
parkway:
to provide a protected, safe and suitable approach for
passenger-vehicle traffic to the Nation's Capital and for an
additional means of access between the several Federal
establishments adjacent thereto and the seat of government in
the District of Columbia [P.L. 81-643}.

In 1953 the U.S. Park Police assumed jurisdiction and in 1965 both
Greenbelt and the Parkway were placed under Catoctin Mountain Park.
In 1995 they were placed under National Capital Parks - East.

Both Greenbelt and the Parkway are easily accessible. Greenbelt is
in a suburban and increasingly urban setting just six miles from
Washington, DC in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Major commuter
routes border three sides of the park. The Parkway is a major
commuter route between Baltimore to Washington. Its width varies
from 350 to 1000 feet as it travels through portions of Baltimore,
Anne Arundel, and Prince Georges Counties.

Greenbelt, within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, is in the Anacostia
River watershed. Deep and Still Creeks drain into the northwest
branch of the Anacostia below Indian Creek. Many of the park soils
are relatively impermeable, causing the forest to be interspersed
with wet meadows and swampy areas. There is a peat bog in the
eastern part of the park.

The Parkway is on the western edge of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.
The southern part is drained by minor tributaries of the Anacostia
River but drainage north of Powder Mill Road runs is to the
Chesapeake Bay via the Patuxent, Little Patuxent, and the Patapsco
rivers.

What is now a mature forest of pine and oak in Greenbelt Park is
primarily reforested tobacco farmland. Historic maps from the Civil
War era indicate farm house sites and vegetative groupings indicate
old fields. A brief, informal survey along the north branch of
Still Creek discovered some lithics and ceramics (undocumented).

Both prehistoric and historic sites are recorded on the Parkway but
there is no documentation for sites in Greenbelt Park. Both areas
have relatively high potential for prehistoric sites due to their
location near the Fall Line. There are several recorded sites in
the vicinity. If the presence of inland swamps and wetlands in
Greenbelt can be confirmed prehistorically, then that would add to
the high probability of hunting and collecting sites. Although the
likelihood of site survival is somewhat compromised due to stream

IIl. STATUS OF INVENTORY /NACE 249



=== Page 280 ===

bank and other erosion in Greenbelt and the effects of limited
grading on the Parkway, there is still high potential for
prehistoric sites. The likelihood of historic period site is high
as well. There are several documented along the parkway and
historic maps indicate sites in Greenbelt.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

One prehistoric issue for Greenbelt is the use of the tributary
streams and inland marsh. One historical period issue is the use
of the landscape after the Civil War, when soil exhaustion must
already have taken its toll.

PRWI - PRINCE WILLIAM FOREST PARK

President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order in 1936 to transfer
exhausted land to the Department of Interior. One result of this
transfer was the establishment of the Chopawamsic Recreation
Demonstration Project. In 1940 the Demonstration project became
part of the National Park Service and in 1953 Congress authorized
the Secretary of Interior to acquire interest in land within the
watershed.

Prince William Forest Park is in Prince William County, Virginia
just 35 miles south of Washington. It is visited by approximately
500,000 persons per year. Except for the camping areas and trails
and boundary areas, park lands are not particularly easily
accessible, although they are bordered by I-95 and State Routes 619
and 234. The Chopawamsic Backcountry area is managed as a
wilderness.

The park straddles the Fall Line with two-thirds of its land in the
Piedmont and one-third in the Coastal Plain. The park is one of
the most significant representations of a Piedmont ecosystem in the
National Park System. Most of the Quantico Creek watershed is
within the park.

The CCC camps are the only intact historical structures in the
park, but there are remains of the Pyrite Mine which operated until
1920, abandoned communities and farm sites, and over 30 cemeteries.

In the Overview and Assessment for the park, Parker (1985) suggests
that for most of prehistory the park area was a hinterland used in
a transient manner. Little intensive settlement is expected to
have occurred in prehistoric times. The land was more extensively
settled by tobacco farmers in the early 18th century. Small
farmsteads and both black and white communities grew during the
19th century. There is a very high likelihood of historic
archeological resources throughout the park and a high likelihood
of prehistoric sites along the stream drainages.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

One prehistoric research topic is the hypothesized use of the area
as a “demilitarized zone" between Potomac chiefdoms on Coastal
Plain and Siouian settlements in the Piedmont. There are
potentially many sites in the park which would indicate transient
use of the area.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY/PRWI 251


=== Page 282 ===

Another issue is the development of a context for lithic scatters,
which are very common prehistoric resources within the park
boundaries. Lithic scatters are often dismissed due to a lack of
temporal diagnostics, but they potentially hold valuable
information on the use of the landscape.

One historical archeological research issue would address 18th and
19th century farming and rural communities (both free black and
white before the Civil War and black and white after the war).
Research could address consumer behavior, resource sharing and
cooperation, competition, and the degree of integration or
segregation of races between and within rural communities before
the Depression.

ROCR - ROCK CREEK PARK

Rock Creek Park was established in 1890 for recreational purposes.
It is a large urban park in the northwest quadrant of Washington,
DC and is completely accessible by public roadways. Over 2 million
people visit the park annually.

Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway were authorized in 1913 "for the
purpose of preventing the pollution and obstruction of Rock Creek
and of connecting Potomac Park with the Zoological Park and Rock
Creek Park."

The park straddles the Fall Line with land in both the Piedmont and
Coastal Plain. Rock Creek contains mile-long rapids over the Fall
Line. Approximately 80% of the park is in second growth forest.

The built resources in Rock Creek Park are extensive. Pierce Mill,
for example, is the only mill remaining of eight along Rock Creek.
There are also some of the Fort Circle Parks, some features of the
C&O Canal, the Godey Lime Kilns, the Old Stone House, Klingle
Mansion, and many other historic resources. It is very likely that
many or most of these have archeological resources associated with
them. The prehistoric use of quarries within park lands was
documented in the late 19th century. Transitory basecamps are also
documented.

Inashima (1985:51,83) summarizes some of the uses of the area:
The regions of the lower falls appears to have been a
transitional zone between two mutually antagonistic groups,
the Massamacks and the Pascattowies...The almost four
centuries of the historic era of the lower Rock Creek Valley
have contained a large number of changes. At first, the
valley, as it had previously, served as a frontier between
different cultural groups. During prehistoric time, it had
roughly defined a boundary separating various Indian tribes.
Later, it marked an upper limit of contact between the
European pioneers and traders and the native Indian groups.
Following this, Rock Creek provided the water power to drive
the initial industrial base of the Territory of Columbia. [In
the last century, it has functioned as a natural enclave
within the urban confines of Washington, D.C.

Archeological potential within the park is high for both
prehistoric and historic resources.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics

are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

III. STATUS OF INVENTORY /ROCR 253


=== Page 284 ===

One prehistoric issue, besides the obvious concerns about
quarrying, is the use of the area by mutually antagonistic groups
on either side of the Fall Line during late prehistory.

A related historic period question would address the use of the

area, perhaps as a trading zone, before European settlers moved
into the Piedmont.

WHSE - WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT'S PARK

The White House has been the official residence and office of every
President since John Adams. The surrounding park lands are known
as President's Park.

Within this administrative unit are the White House and South Lawn,
Ellipse, Treasury and Old Executive Office Buildings, and Lafayette
Park. President's Park encompasses the area from Constitution
Avenue north to H Street between 15th and 17th streets with the
exception of two privately owned blocks flanking Lafayette Park.

The residence act of 1790 authorized Washington as the permanent
seat of government and stated that it was necessary to "provide
suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress, and of the
President, and for the public offices of the government of the
United States" (1 Stat. 130). In 1797 Reservation Number 1 set
aside 83 acres for the President's residence and park. This
reservation included the present day Lafayette Park, White House
grounds and President's Park South.

In 1961 The National Park Service was given responsibility for
administering the White House and its surrounding grounds (75 Stat.
586).

The land is within the Coastal Plain and, before infilling during
the i9th century, overlooked Tiber Creek. An archeological
evaluation of President's Park compared the land contours
documented during the late 18th century with the current landscape.
It is highly likely that there was prehistoric use of the site and
“prehistoric resources may be preserved wherever landscaping of the
site has involved the deposition of fill over the original grade of
elevated areas" (Pousson and Hoepfner 1995:10). The authors of the
evaluation suggest, however, that ground moving and landscaping
have probably disturbed most of the potential resources. They
infer that the only high probability of survival of intact
archeological resources is of the World War II barracks south of
the First Division Memorial (Pousson and Hoepfner 1995).

This plan is in agreement with the recommendation of Pousson and
Hoepfner that provisions be established for unanticipated
discoveries of potentially significant archeological resources in
President's Park.

WOTR - WOLF TRAP FARM PARK

Wolf Trap Farm Park was the first park specifically designated as
a national area for the performing arts. In 1966 Congress
established it as "a park for the performing arts and related
educational programs, and for recreational use in connections
therewith" (PL 89-671).

The park is located in a suburban area of northern Virginia and is
easily accessible by road. The park is bisected by Trap Road,
which connects major highways.

Much of the park is wooded and is drained by Wolf Trap Creek and
Old Courthouse Spring Branch. Erosion is a serious problem.

From the 18th century until 1930 the area was a farm. Originally
part of the McDaniel plantation, the land continued to be farmed
after that plantation was subdivided into tracts in 1850,

There are some prehistoric resources documented at the confluence
of the two creeks which run through the park. Although a 1979
assessment assumes that historical archeological resources have
been disturbed, that assumption apparently was never tested. It is
likely that there are further archeological resources, both
prehistoric and historic, in the park.

There is no documentation for known sites within the park in the
office of archeologist at the National Capital Area SSO.

Archeological Issues

It is important for the reader to understand that research topics
are offered as examples only. There are myriad issues which could
be investigated with the resources in the park.

A historic period issue to be addressed would be to document and
explain the change in farm life which accompanied extensive
economic changes after the subdivision of the plantation. What was
the relationship of the occupants in this area with the growing
federal city? What were the economic and social consequences for
both black and white inhabitants of changing the structure of
farming before the Civil War?

SCOPE OF PROJECTS

Archeological Overview and Assessment Projects

There are only a few formal Overview and Assessment documents for
parks or sections of parks within the National Capital Area (see
Table III.1). This plan is designed to serve as an archeological
overview of the entire National Capital Area. It provides an
overview of history and prehistory within the Potomac Basin
(excluding the Shenandoah River Valley). It also provides data on
site predictive models and predicted site locations. However, it
does not provide the level of detail required at the park level.
For example, this plan's overview does not provide historic maps of
park areas or details about landforms which are essential for
predicting and testing site locations.

An Archeological Overview and Assessment describes the known and
potential archeological resources in a given area, such as a
particular tract of land, a district within a park, or an entire
park unit. The overview consists of a review and summary of
existing archeological’data and the assessment is an evaluation of

these data. For this study, present knowledge is gathered,
evaluated, and analyzed to make general statements regarding the
nature, distribution, and significance of the resources.

Recommendations for future research and predictions about potential
impacts on the resource base are made.

The overview and assessment should contain the following
information: an abstract, management summary (one to three pages),
introduction and description of the study, description of the
present natural and cultural environment as it affects both the
archeological resources and the ability to conduct archeological
research, research goals and strategy, methods of data collection
and analysis, summary and evaluation of current knowledge (based on
the culture history, ethnohistory, material culture, and archival
collections pertinent to the study area), management
recommendations, references, and appendices containing a listing of
material culture collections, field records, and archives relevant
to the archeology and ethnohistory of the study area.

In many instances, an overview and assessment is the first step in
an Archeological Survey and Identification Study. As such, the
overview and assessment also should contain a research design which
spells out the Archeological Survey and Identification Study's
theoretical and substantive goals, and the methods by which these
are to be accomplished.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 263


=== Page 294 ===

Archeological Survey and Inventory Projects

Archeological inventory projects traditionally have focused on
single park units and, for the most part, projects proposed in this
plan do so as well. No projects involving parks outside of the
National Capital Area are proposed in this SAIP plan. While it
would be possible to plan such projects, the anticipated
difficulties in scheduling funding and sharing resources outweighed
the advantages. It remains possible to design such projects if
logistical problems can be addressed.

In some cases more than one unit are grouped for an inventory
project. For example, the units of Greenbelt and the Baltimore-
Washington Parkway, which were transferred from the superintendency
of Catoctin Mountain Park to that of National Capital Parks - East
in 1995, will be surveyed together. Similarly, portions of
National Capital Parks - East (NACE) and the George Washington
Memorial Parkway (GWMP) will be grouped together for practical
reasons of location and access. The C & O Canal NHP and Harpers

Ferry NHP will be split into sections. The C&0 Canal, in
particular, would be difficult logistically to do as one project,
Since the park stretches for 185 miles along the Potomac. Two

proposed projects incorporate portions of more than one park under
a particular theme. A survey of the archeological resources of the
Civil War Defenses around Washington, D.C. includes portions of
NACE, ROCR, and GWMP. A survey of shoreline changes of the Potomac
and Anacostia Rivers includes portions of NACC, NACE, GWMP, and
ROCR.

The purpose of an Archeological Survey is to discover and describe
the locations, and some of the characteristics of all or a sample
of archeological resources in a particular area. This task may be
accomplished by an on-the-ground survey, shovel testing, limited
excavations, geophysical prospecting, remote sensing, or any
combination of the above. An Archeological Survey and
Identification Study includes the following sections: an abstract,
management summary, introduction and description of the study,
research goals and strategy, methods of data collection and
analysis, data description and analysis, evaluation = and
interpretation of the cultural resources, recommendations, and an
appendix containing an inventory of the artifacts collected.

For each new archeological site identified during the survey, the
appropriate state archeological site form and an NPS Archeological
Sites Management Information System form (ASMIS) must be completed.
All artifacts and documentation resulting from the archeological
fieldwork must be processed according to the procedures outlined in
the Regional Archeology Program Laboratory Manual.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 264

Archeological Evaluation Projects and National Register Nominations

Archeological evaluation projects and National Register nominations
often will cover just one site. However, in many cases it would be
advantageous to complete a Multiple Property Listing nomination for
a particular category of sites within a park or throughout parks
within a cluster. With a Multiple Property Listing in place,
several individual nominations may be prepared and placed in
context. One advantage to such an approach is that, because the
multiple listing compiles relevant information and explains the
significance of many properties, it is readily adaptable to
interpretive needs. For example, portions of Multiple Property
Listings may be modified into pamphlets or brochures for the
visiting public. Such documents also provide park interpreters
with ready access to information about their park and neighboring
parks.

When archeological survey and inventory has been completed for
particular park units, it may be reasonable to prepare nominations
of archeological districts, Of course, it is often appropriate to
prepare individual nominations for sites which have been evaluated
and determined eligible.

The purpose of an Archeological Evaluation Study is to collect and
analyze sufficient information to determine whether or not an
archeological site or property is eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places. Often, evaluation studies are
linked to survey and identification studies.

Archeological properties are identified for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places by determining their
integrity, research potential, and identifying the National
Register criteria that apply to them. Evaluation within the
framework of the National Register criteria defines which
properties, or classes of properties, are significant, and which
attributes of those properties make them significant. In addition
to a report fully documenting the results of the fieldwork and
analysis (following the general outline given for a Survey and
Identification Study), this type of study includes the acceptable
completion of the National Register Nomination form(s) for the
particular site(s) identified in the Work Order, including original
field notes, maps, photographs, figures, and any other data used in
preparing the nomination (refer to National Register Bulletin 16A,
"How to Complete the National Register Registration Form"). All
artifacts and documentation resulting from the evaluation study
must be processed according to the procedures outlined in the
Regional Archeology Program Laboratory Manual.

INTERACTION WITH NON-NPS PARTIES

As required by NPS policy, implementation of survey and inventory
projects will include interaction between the National Capital Area
parks and System Support Office and the Historic Preservation
Offices of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of
Columbia. Survey efforts will be coordinated with the Historic
Preservation Offices through the following: use of state site
forms, completion and update of old forms, reference to state
standards and guidelines, links with existing GIS systems, and
progress reports and meetings.

Research designs which include Native American concerns will
include consultation with appropriate Native American groups and
organizations. Similarly, archeological research of possible
interest to other constituencies and communities will involve
consultation. An example of a case requiring consultation would be
a project with concerns connected with the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).

As appropriate, the ethnographic program of the National Park
Service may be called upon to assist with consultation. Currently,
the Native American groups with which parks in the National Capital
Area would be most likely to consult are the factions of the
Piscataway: The Maryland Indian Heritage Society, the Piscataway-
Conoy & Subtribes, and the Piscataway Indian Nation (see Cissna
1994).

As appropriate for particular research designs and technical
reports review will be requested of individual researchers outside
of NPS. In some cases scholars based at colleges and universities
may be able to obtain outside funding in order to pursue research
on NPS property.

The System Support Office (SSO) of the National Capital Area
currently holds a cooperative agreements with the University of
Maryland, College Park (UMCP) History Department. The recent
surveys of Manassas NBP and earlier studies at Harpers Ferry NHP
were conducted through the cooperative agreement with the
Anthropology Department which expired in January 1995. In addition
to Anthropology and History, the American Studies Department
provides a further source of talented graduate students who may
pursue internships and Masters or Doctoral level research on park
archeology issues. Graduate student internships have been
coordinated through the Internship Office at UMCP.

The System Support Office of the National Capital Area currently
administers an Indefinite Quantities contract (IQ) for all types of
archeological services. IQ contracts are renewable for four years
in addition to the base year. Greiner, Inc. was awarded an IQ in

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 266


=== Page 297 ===

FY94, Archeological services also are available through a
subcontracted firm with the SSO's Architectural and Engineering IQ.

Harpers Ferry NHP holds a cooperative agreement with the University
of West Virginia's Institute for the History of Technology and
Industrial Archeology. It is recommended that other parks also
pursue cooperative agreements. For example, Prince William Forest
Park and Manassas National Battlefield Park could pursue agreements
through Mary Washington College's historic preservation program.

Whether operating through a cooperative agreement or contracting
for services, it is essential to insist on staffing with
professionals. The Secretary of Interior Guidelines (rather than
OPM standards) should be used to judge credentials. Professional
standards should be strictly enforced for all phases of any
project: background research and research design, field,
laboratory, analysis and reporting, and collections management.

INTERACTION WITHIN NPS

The Archeology Program of the National Capital Area plans to
coordinate with individual parks for the creation and maintenance
of GIS data bases for archeological resources and the mapping of
resource locations using GPS. Each park should include within its
Resource Management Plan a project for GIS recording of cultural
resources.

There is no doubt that carrying out projects in-house by hiring and
supervising personnel directly is much more cost-effective than
contracting for services. However, the difficulties of creating
and filling non-permanent positions efficiently sometime seem
insurmountable. The creation of a_ regional, interpark
archeological survey team would be the most cost-effective strategy
for fulfilling the survey needs of the region. Such a team,
whether based at one park, successively at different parks with
adequate physical plant, or at a central location, such as a
Cultural Resource Center which would serve the National Capital
Area, could efficiently carry out survey projects.

Because of the problems involved in hiring archeologists and
spending SAIP funds within their allotted fiscal year, it is more
reasonable for the present to undertake archeological survey
contracting out for services. The SSO of the National Capital Area
now has an Indefinite Quantities Contract with a firm to perform
the full range of archeological services required for the SAIP
projects as well as for other needs. The 5-year IQ which was
awarded in FY94 is with Greiner, Inc.

If no internal archeological team can be organized, it is
anticipated that the contracted firm will perform much, but not
all, of the SAIP projects scheduled during FY94 and the following
four years. However, it is recommended to hire personnel to carry
out the survey projects for the C&O Canal so that this long-term
project can realize the savings of performing work in-house.

SURVEY COVERAGE AND METHODS

Survey data are not simply preliminary or
supplementary to archeological excavation, but
rather can provide a means of independently
addressing critical research issues concerning
the dynamics of regional social organization
and structure.

Hantman 1987:99

Systematic survey for archeological sites, therefore, may be
structured as research and will contribute critical information for
many questions. Such questions include the understanding of long
term use of the landscape by many different groups of people, the
development of territoriality by competing groups, and the
different problem-solving approaches taken by people in different
ecological settings.

Appropriate Survey Size

The acreage of National Parks in the National Capital Area
comprises a sample, albeit a nonrandom sample, of land in the
Potomac Basin. The river basin may be considered as an
archeological region but it should be recognized that the scale of
human use of any region will change over time. As stated in the
section below, The Argument for Full-coverage Survey, cultural and
ethnic boundaries vary greatly and therefore the scale of
functional networks, or "behavioral regions" varies greatly.

The appropriate size of an archeological survey area will depend on
the spatial scale of social organization being studied. Because
this land has been used by low-density hunter-gatherers and densely
packed town and city dwellers and everyone in between, initial
archeological survey and inventory should be designed to address
this range of variation.

Jeffrey Hantman (1987:99) emphasizes the "need to consider the size
of a survey universe prior to drawing conclusions about the nature
of regional social organization and demography." He notes
(1987:104) that the "trend of the last century towards smaller
survey areas is being reversed. This requires more long-term
survey research projects which allow more contiguous area to be
intensively surveyed or sampled.

Full-coverage survey is ideal, but is not immediately achievable,
As discussed below under Sites and Distributional Archeology.
Ebert recommends multistage surveys at increasing levels of
intensity as an approach to ultimately achieving full coverage.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 269


=== Page 300 ===

The Argument for Full-coverage Survey

There are strong arguments to be made in support of full-coverage
survey, which may be defined as the “examination of large,
contiguous blocks of terrain systematically, at a level of
intensity commensurate with the research questions being asked"
(Fish and Kowalewski 1990:261). Due to difficulties in funding and
logistics, it is difficult to accomplish full-coverage surveys in
non-research settings and, I would add, it is often as difficult to
envision surveys as a research rather than a compliance process.

In their book on the archeology of regions, Suzanne Fish and

Stephen Kowalewski (1990:262) argue that
full-coverage regional survey generates rich data in great
amounts, provides the appropriate framework for a broader
range of anthropological issues that can be addressed with
areal sampling methods, is less costly than commonly
perceived, and in the long run is a better use of limited
archeological resources.

Fish and Kowalewski argue for the interpretive potential of full-
coverage survey, emphasizing that for any survey, the archeologist
needs a clear concept of the scale of events under study and the
set of techniques appropriate for that scale (1990:262). For
example, Ebert's (1992) discussion of "distributional" rather than
site-oriented material patterning points up the importance of full-
coverage, high-intensity survey for the remains of highly mobile
hunter-gatherers since their traces are likely to be difficult to
identify with traditional survey techniques. Certainly there is
long-term change in the scale and boundaries of regions in terms of
common cultural or ethnic identity and therefore survey coverage
must be sufficiently flexible and of a large enough area to address
boundary variations. To address the issue of complexity, survey
must target beyond the level of the site to see functional
networks; Fish and Kowalewski (1990:272) term these targets
"behavioral regions."

Keith Kintigh (1990:241) argues that to have any chance of
recognizing critical patterning in a sample survey, an archeologist
must work with quadrat sizes larger than the largest unit of
spatial patterning. It is difficult to approach questions of group
boundaries with sample survey. George Cowgill (1986) argues that
no statistical scheme will make sample survey a good way to
understand regional settlement patterns.

Although Fred Plog (1990) disagrees with most of Fish and
Kowalewski's reasons for preferring full-coverage survey, he sees
two convincing arguments. First, "when one intends a functional and
paleoethnographic analysis of the network of relations that existed
among the inhabitants of sites in an area, full-coverage data are
essential." Second, archeologists need high quality, full-coverage

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 270


=== Page 301 ===

data to understand the best ways to interpret sample data. That
is, full-coverage data can act as a control for experimental
comparisons of sample sizes and methods.

For the purposes of full-coverage survey, Cowgill (1990) defines a
region as an area large enough to include all sites occupied by
reasonably well-defined social units during periods of interest.
The intensity, that is survey interval, and the sensitivity, that
is the probability of detection of an occurrence, depend upon the
following: 1) nature of the occurrence; 2) the nature of terrain;
3) the closeness of approach of the observer to the occurrence; 4)
the extent to which observers are sensitized to types of
occurrences; and 5) the extent to which special techniques are
used, such as shovel tests, trenching, GPR, photographs,etc. He
argues for high intensity survey if small sites are not to be
missed. To gather good data on small sites one should 1) space
closely, and 2) rethink and reclassify what are data, considering
"non-sites."

Full-coverage survey requires a long-term commitment. Advantages
include high quality of information and completeness while
disadvantages include the time required and the difficulty of
sustaining the commitment as well as the possibility that over time
ideas will change about what are adequate data (Fish and Kowalewski
1990:265).

Fish and Kowalewski (1990:266) have some specific suggestions for
strategies. Because archeological remains in temperate areas are
seasonally observed, sparse and dispersed, archeologists must make
repeated visits to the same sites, extending duration of survey as
needed. The positive results of such continuous and repeated
observation of large areas is supported by other researchers as
well. It is also recommended to initially concentrate where the
ground conditions are best, controlling for the bias caused by the

concentration on accessible areas. There also must be very
organized ways of keeping track of the terrain covered and ground
conditions at the time of surveys. Locational data may be

collected via Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) and data
organized in a Geographic Information System (GIS) data base.
There must also be flexible artifact inventories so that sequential
collections can be merged or separated.

Cost considerations are always a limiting factor of archeological
research. “Sample coverage will not produce the same full maps,
rank-size graphs, measures of interaction, boundaries, functional
hierarchies, or displays of rare and frequent artifact types."
(Fish and Kowalewski 1990:275). Not only is full-coverage survey
less costly per unit area due to start-up costs, but it is also
less costly over the long run because the information gathered can
be used for many questions not identified at the time of field
work. Full-coverage data may be stratified in various ways

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 271


=== Page 302 ===

according to different environmental and other factors. Jeffrey

Parsons (1990:28) also emphasizes this flexibility:
Full-coverage data are robust and can become relevant to many
different questions. Sampling schemes certainly provide good
information for some very specific kinds of questions.
However, I suspect this information is likely to be
increasingly less useful to different questions posed by
future investigators.

Parsons (1990) believes that full-coverage is feasible where the
main objective is to delineate distributions of large, dense
concentrations and that non-site archeology requires its own
methodology. Fish et al. (1990:213), however, emphasize that
"non-sites," that is, dispersed but related remains, can be bounded
by full-coverage but not by standard survey.

The reasons for regional survey have been Clearly articulated in
the archeological literature in discussions of settlements systems,
site function and regional interaction (e.g., Parsons 1972). Full-
coverage survey is one of the best ways to detect counter-intuitive
settlement patterns (Parsons 1990).

Jeffrey Dean (1990) describes the intensive survey of a small
valley in northeastern Arizona, and notes the kinds of information
that would have been impossible without ful] coverage. More
satisfactory investigation of his research design, focused on the
relationship between settlement behavior and environmental
variability, was possible because he was able to record low
frequency sites and materials, low visibility sites, and a range of
variability. Dean (1990:187) writes,
However, in our intellectual fascination with the intricacies
and apparent certitudes of sampling theory and method, we
sometimes lose sight of the fact that our goal is
understanding past human behavior, not just the statistical
behavior of probabilistic samples. In eliminating the need to
estimate site population parameters from statistical samples,
complete survey allows us to confront directly the much more
fundamental, more difficult, and ultimately more important
issue of what kind of sample of past human behavior is
represented by the archeological data.

The uncritical standard of 10 per cent or other of random sample
limits the results of archeological survey (Whalen 1990). Michael
Whalen (1990:222) lists some of the limitations of sampling: 1) for
sampling of any sort, the greater the population variance, the less
accurately that variance is reflected in a small sample from that
population, therefore samples are unlikely to capture the extent of
settlement system variability; 2) rare things are likely to be
overlooked; 3) much sampling theory is based on parametric
assumptions, but archeological sites are not normally distributed
and therefore parametric statistics are inappropriate.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 272


=== Page 303 ===

Estimates for the level of effort required for full-coverage survey
vary. Paul Fish and Thomas Gresham (1990) report 640 person-days
needed to survey 53 square km (13,064 acres) of the Wallace
reservoir. They quote Kent Lightfoot's estimate that 80 person-
days are needed to adequately characterize a 25-acre area using 10
m interval shovel test pits. The difference between an estimate of
20 acres per person-day versus 3.2 person-days per acre reflects
the techniques used. Because the Wallace reservoir was totally
stripped of vegetation, it was possible to survey the ground
surface visually. In most areas, and certainly within the National
Parks, there will be few such opportunities excepting following
natural disasters such as major forest fires.

Because SAIP is a research-oriented program with a long-term
commitment to documenting archeological resources, it is
recommended here that full-coverage survey through a variety of
methods be the target for each park unit to be surveyed within the
National Capital Area. It is recognized that such an effort will
require many years and an integrated, coherent program which tracks
results effectively. Each park will need to begin with more
limited testing which will create a data base to which information
can be added indefinitely.

Sites and Distributional Archeology

The concept of a site, a place where there is archeological
evidence of past human activity, has been a mainstay of
archeological thought and writing. The inadequacy of the site
concept has been pointed out occasionally by archaeologists who
have attempted to supplement it with "non-site sites" (e.g.,
Dunnell and Dancey 1983; Lewarch and O'Brien 1981). The definition
of what constitutes a site is problematic for archeologists,
especially where there are but a few artifacts clustered together
in an area of unspecified boundary. It is recognized that the
archeological record often is not clustered.

One of the most compelling discussions of the shortcomings of
looking at sites alone as evidence of past activity is by James
Ebert. In his description of “distributional archaeology," Ebert
(1992:7) declares that he is looking at "archaeology based not upon
sites but upon the scales and distributions of the actual,
definable physical items occurring in the surface archaeological
record across large, contiguous landscapes." Ebert's focus on
surface material rather than sealed sites lets him concentrate on
mobility and human use of the whole landscape rather than on
discrete, rare places. He points out that one of the major problems
with sites as such is that they presuppose settlement of sufficient
duration or repetition that occupants' discards accumulate into an
observable archeological record.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 273


=== Page 304 ===

While Ebert is probably too critical of the site concept,
advocating dismantling it completely, he does have an important
methodological contribution, particularly for the archeology of
non-sedentary people. There is indeed a continuous archeological
record, formed by the activity of people who used the landscape as
a continuous whole. Archeology aimed at recovering mobility
patterns and use of the landscape must make no a priori assumptions
about boundaries or the integrity of clusters of artifacts or
features.

Ebert is correct in pointing out that many survey strategies are
self-fulfilling. He writes (1992:70) that “many 'meager,' simple
behavioral episodes overlap to yield, in some places, a dense
record comprised of hundreds of episodes that are not necessarily
functionally related." While we cannot see whole systems, we must
sample areas as large as possible. Multistage surveys conducted at
decreasing intervals to locate sites and clusters are one technique
for doing this.

The whole of the archeological record within large areas of
landscape needs to be located and recorded. When one, in fact,
looks for artifacts as if they might be anywhere, it turns out they
are everywhere. The information yield is quite high compared to
the definition and recording of "sites" alone. (Ebert 1992:166ff).
Sites, in fact, are "but one component of what we really what to
know about: systems of human organization" (Ebert 1992:245).

On-the-Ground Survey

Before any archeological field work is done there should be
background research and an explicit research design. The purposes
of the background research include the following:

a) to develop the property's appropriate historic and prehistoric
contexts,

b) to provide background information necessary for predicting and
interpreting the property's archeological resources, and

c) to refine and further develop the research questions that the
archeological data will be used to address in following the
project's research design.

It is also extremely helpful in designing archeological field work
to have a geomorphological study done of the park or section of the
park to by surveyed. Geomorphological study will help to identify
areas in which the likelihood of archeological sites of different
ages is high or low. For example, river terraces which are only
4000 years old will not contain sites older than that, nor would it
be worth surveying by shovel test pits in floodplain areas where
sites are expected to be deeply buried under alluvial deposits.

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 274


=== Page 305 ===

In the eastern United States, prehistoric sites characteristically
have poor visibility (McManamon 1984). The most common constituents
ef the archeological record are 1) artifacts, 2) features, 3)
anthropic soil horizons, 4) chemical anomalies, and 5) instrument
anomalies, such as magnetic and electrical properties (McManamon
1984:228). Of these, artifacts are the most widespread and
abundant as well as durable and recognizable. Therefore,
techniques that detect artifacts are the most effective for site
discovery. Techniques for detecting other site aspects are useful
for analysis within a site.

Surface inspection and subsurface testing for artifacts have been
the most effective methods for site discovery in the eastern
woodlands, although remote sensing for soil horizons may prove
effective given the right visibility (McManamon 1984).

Frank McManamon (1984) describes and assesses four types of
subsurface probes, all of which are limited in depth and therefore
useful only for sites close to the surface. 1) Soil cores of
approximately l-inch diameter are better for investigating known
sites than discovering new ones. 2) Auger holes 4-6 inches wide
can be useful in dense artifact concentrations but soil profiles
are difficult to see. 3) Divots, which expose an area of surface,
again are useful for dense concentrations. 4) Shovel test pits are
the largest volume subsurface probes and may reveal not only
artifacts, but features and soil horizons as well. "Screening is
a crucial part of the shovel test technique" (McManamon 1984:261),
a part not always practiced in the mid-Atlantic.

Archeologists have debated the effectiveness of shovel test pits
(STP) for site discovery (e.g,, Kintigh 1988; Lightfoot 1989;
McManamon 1984; Nance and Ball 1989; Shott 1985, 1989). Jack Nance
and Bruce Ball (1989:411) advocate the use of STPs along with other
techniques. Lightfoot (1989:416) declares that in spite of the
shortcomings, STPs are the most effective survey method for
discovering buried cultural remains on a regional scale.

The factors that affect site discovery using subsurface probes are
1) site size, 2) frequency and intrasite distribution of artifacts,
3) size of probe, and 4) number and spacing of probe (McManamon
1984). Given these factors and the thinly distributed remains on
battlefields, it is no surprise that STPs do not usually work will
to find artifacts scattered over very large areas. In such cases,
particularly in the Civil War parks, the systematic use of metal
detectors by archeologists is an effective survey technique which
targets one type of resource.

Surface inspection is quick and effective if 1) at least part of
the site is on the surface and 2) there is sufficient visibility
for site contents to be recognized. In the east, visibility is
available, for example, along eroding shorelines, roadway cuts, and

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 275


=== Page 306 ===

in plowed fields. Surface visibility may be improved by plowing or
raking,for example, but such disturbance will only improve site
discovery if sites are detectable at the surface. Deeply buried
sites generally will be detected only through deep trenching.

The following example illustrates how much more productive an
archeological survey may be when visibility is extremely good.

Discussing the Wallace Reservoir studies in the Georgia Piedmont,
Fish and Gresham (1990) contrast the recovery between subsurface
transects spaced at 80 meters, which recovered 18 sites, and full-
coverage survey after vegetation removal, which exposed over 3000
sites. Comparison of full-coverage data with that collected in
earlier surveys revealed a number of differences: 1) There was an
earlier underrepresentation of upland sites; over 8.5% of the full-
coverage sites were on land with a slope of over 10%; 2) Very
small sites of less than 10 artifacts often were missed in earlier
survey; 3) A significant over-representation of Mississippian
(large village) sites was apparent in the earlier work with no
Paleoindian or Late Woodland Napier material, both of which were
well-represented in the full-coverage survey; 4) an average of more
artifacts per site was collected in the full-coverage survey.

Except in park areas which are scheduled for construction, there is
no reason to anticipate the sort of vegetation removal which would
provide such visibility as in the above example.

Remote Sensing and Geophysical Prospecting

For intrasite analysis, non-invasive or semi-invasive techniques
are useful for initial characterization of a site or part of a
site. Geophysical prospecting is the use of high-resolution
geophysical methods for archeological site prospection (not
sourcing or dating studies). These methods may also be called
"archeological remote sensing," “archeogeophysics," or
“archeological prospection" (the term mostly used in Europe).
"Remote sensing" is often used by North American archeologists, but
conveys to geophysicists the idea of air or space borne imagery
only.

Tie purposes of remote sensing and geophysical techniques in
archeology include site discovery, which is generally through

aerial reconnaissance, and intrasite mapping. There are
differences between traditional methods and geophysical methods for
both site discovery and intrasite evaluation. Advantages to

geophysical methods are that they are nondestructive and provide
rapid reconnaissance. The major limitation to geophysical methods
is due to the fact that geophysics is an indirect science using
non-contact techniques. The best it can do is detect anomalies,
which must be observed directly to be interpreted. Other

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 276


=== Page 307 ===

limitations are that these techniques are instrument intensive, and
therefore initially expensive; they detect nonanthropogenic sources
for anomalies and noise; there are resolution and depth
limitations; and features must be sufficiently different from
surrounding terrain to be detected, while anthropogenic features
are often quite subtle, creating weak signals.

It is recommended that geophysical prospecting be incorporated into
most of the survey projects in the parks. Available techniques are
listed and briefly described below. The selection of any
particular technique will depend upon local geomorphological
conditions as well as budgetary concerns.

Aerial Reconnaissance. Aerial reconnaissance and photography has
a long history of use for archeological purposes. Photographs have
been taken not only from airplanes, but also from model airplanes,
kites, and balloons.

Aerial photographs may detect above-surface features such as
structures or soil horizons, shadowmarks caused by structural
remains, and plant or soil marks caused by subsurface features or
soil horizons (McManamon 1984). Aerial photography is especially
good for sites with widespread features and soil horizons.

In the Potomac Coastal Plain, Potter (1993:56) identifies some
guidelines for aerial reconnaissance. The best time for low
altitude aerial flights is late winter or early spring over a
winter crop such as wheat, which grows denser, greener, and thicker
over midden deposits. In plowed fields, damp soil marks are most
visible right after disc-harrowing done for spring planting.

Electrical Resistivity and Conductivity, including Metal Detectors.
Electrical Resistivity is the most flexible and most generally
useful technique in the largest variety of sites and is the best
method for control or adjustment of depth of investigation (Bruce
Bevan, personal communication).

Resistance is measure of difficulty of pushing electricity through
ground; more resistance requires more voltage. A map of electrical
resistivity map is approximately a map of soil moisture. Because
soil changes moisture content seasonally, a map may be missing
readings of some major features if drainage and the season prevent
productive resistivity work. Therefore, it is best to take
readings at different seasons. Resistive structures include walls
(stone is usually highly resistant electrically) and isolated
structures such as graves. Conductive structures include pits and
ditches excavated in resistant material such as limestone or
alluvial sands.

Conductivity is the inverse of resistivity and there are other
techniques to measure it. Electromagnetic (EM) surveys detect

IV. REGIONWIDE STRATEGIES 277


=== Page 308 ===

metals (ferrous and nonferrous) and changes in soil conductivity,
which may be related to moisture or chemical content. Current is
induced into the ground and electrical conductivity is measured.
The advantage over resistivity is that resistivity meters must make
contact with the ground, while EM meters do not need to. For
example, ice and sand are highly resistant and it may be impossible
to drive sufficient current into the ground to get resistivity
readings. Conductivity is most easily read in saturated soils.

Although often used in illegal and unethical artifact prospecting,
metal detectors do have legitimate archeological uses. Metal
detectors are electromagnetic devices working at low frequencies.
The depth to which they are effective is approximately the diameter
of the search coil. Depth also depends on size and orientation of
object and amount of corrosion, which increases the signal.

Ground Penetrating Radar. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is
commonly used in archeology. GPR works by transmitting high
frequency electromagnetic waves into the earth via an antenna and
recording the energy scattered back by reflecting objects. A
computer calculates this transmission and return and produces a
strip chart printout representing the profile of subsurface
conditions under the antenna's path. Often results are very
subtle. It is best to combine GPR with other methods such as EM
(conductivity), resistivity, and magnetometry. A preliminary
resistivity sounding will indicate type of soil and depth to which
GPR will penetrate. Very clayey soil (low resistivity) will allow
very shallow penetration; very sandy soil (high resistivity) will
allow deep penetration.

In urban settings GPR, for the most part, is not worthwhile. In
fact, most remote sensing is not very effective in urban settings
because of interference from buildings, power lines, cars and other
objects.

Magnetic Prospecting. Magnetic prospecting is very useful and
fairly inexpensive. There are many types of magnetometers. The
proton magnetometer is relatively rugged and provides simple,

cheap, and accurate survey. Archaeological features may be
magnetic or nonmagnetic. Either state can distort the magnetic
field enough to be measured. Magnetic susceptibility or

permeability is a measure of how easy the magnetic field can
penetrate an object or feature. Soils themselves have magnetic
properties. If an object, for example, a hearth, is more permeable
than the soil, then the magnetic field will be stronger through
that object. If an object is less permeable, then readings will
reveal a weaker signal surrounded by a stronger signal. There also
could be similar permeability of soil and object(s) which would
result in very little difference of reading.

Site Data Bases and GIS

The results of all archeological surveys should be entered into a
GIS data base. These results include site location and boundaries,
isolated artifact finds, and the boundaries of the survey area.
Data bases linked to the GIS spatial data base should include
information about the intensity of survey and methodology used as
well as extensive site information.

In all cases it is essential to protect locational information in
all computer data bases so that unauthorized access is not
possible.

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful analytic tool
that can make regional data more useful archeologically. It
provides for the storage, management, retrieval, display, and the
creation of new geographically referenced data (Savage 1990).
Landscape archeology theory, data derived from full-coverage
regional surveys and the GIS tool may come together and redefine
theory. Ezra Zubrow (1990) comments that new problems develop
because new solutions are possible and he is sanguine about GIS's
potential as a new tool to redefine theory. Crumley and Marquardt
emphasize that a dynamic study of regions that incorporates
concepts of landscape, scale, sociohistorical and physical
structures and boundaries is practical now with the use of GIS.

SAIP projects within the National Capital Area should all be
designed to produce GIS data bases and archeological base maps.

V. PROPOSED INVENTORY PROJECTS

For each survey and inventory project the following, at a minimun,
should be accomplished. These are detailed as Requirement #3 of
SAIP (NPS 1992:6):

non-NPS projects;

2) Preparing or revising Archeological Overview and Assessments;
3) Preparing research designs for field studies;

4) Undertaking other appropriate studies and activities that are
essential to successfully plan and implement archeological
inventories; for example, consulting or conducting geomorphological
studies; creation and maintenance of GIS and relational data bases,
including survey boundaries and intensity and non-site artifact
finds as well as site locations; and special studies such as
pollen and phytolith analysis, which contribute valuable
information to historic cultural landscape studies;

5) Preparing interim and final archeological reports;
6) Recording site locational data on Historical Base Maps;

7) Entering data about archeological resources into the NPS'‘'s

10) Preparing National Register of Historic Places nominations for
eligible archeological resources (individual sites, Multiple
Property Listings, Archeological Districts) ;

11) Making the projects' results available to park managers,
planners, interpreters, and other appropriate NPS specialists; and

12) Making the project's results available to the professional
community and to the public, as appropriate.

As stated earlier, this plan may serve as a basic archeological
overview for the National Capital Area. Its scope is too broad,
however, to provide the requisite level of detail for each park,
particularly with regard to background research for the historic
period.

VY. PROPOSED INVENTORY PROJECTS 283


=== Page 314 ===

Archeological Survey and Inventory Projects are defined for park
units within the National Capital Area. The problem statements and
project descriptions are reproduced below as they have been
suggested or are included in each park's revised Resource
Management Plan (RMP). Each park or portion of a park for which
survey and inventory are proposed is listed below the first problem
statement. There are 27 such projects. Portions of some areas have
already been surveyed. Table III.1 and the chronological listing
of work done in parks (Tables III.3 through III.15) should be
consulted. There are two projects which include land in more than
one park: one for the Civil War Defenses of Washington (Fort Circle
Parks) and another to document the shoreline changes of the Potomac
and Anacostia rivers.

For each of these three problem statements there is a rather
generic, but useful, description of the recommended project or
activity. The format for Problem Statement and Recommended Project
is taken from the RMP format.

Following these three problem statements is a preliminary list of
some Multiple Property Listing National Register nominations which
could be prepared to provide a context for some of the
archeological resources in the National Capital Area. Individual
sites evaluations and site nominations to the National Register are
not included in this section because decisions about site
evaluations need to be made based on park needs and budgetary
concerns.

During any annual update of a park's Resource Management Plans, the
park may add projects to evaluate archeological properties under
SAIP.

Nothing in this section or this plan is to be construed as
minimizing the importance of site evaluation. Some reasonable
level of survey and inventory, however, would seem to be desirable
before focusing time and money on particular sites unless there is
a pressing need to do so.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND INVENTORY

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Archeological survey and inventory of [Park/tract - see below] is
insufficient to ensure that archeological resources under NPS
stewardship are conserved, protected, preserved in situ and managed
for long-term scientific research and for appropriate public
interpretation and education. Information about the location,
characteristics and significance of the majority of archeological
resources is lacking. This lack of information seriously impairs
the ability of park managers, planners, interpreters, law
enforcement officers and other specialists to carry out their
responsibilities. The consequences of having insufficient reliable

=== Page 315 ===

information about archeological resources include: (1) Destruction
or unacceptable damage to significant archeological
sites/structures from development, operations, resources
management, visitor use, vandalism or natural/human disasters; (2)
loss of significant and scientifically valuable artifacts due to
development, operations, resources management, visitor use,
vandalism or natural/human disasters; and (3) loss of significant
scientific knowledge due to destruction or damage to archeological
properties.

ARCHEOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF CIVIL WAR DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

To protect the Federal capital against Confederate attack, a ring
of fortifications was constructed on the heights around Washington

=== Page 316 ===

in the early 1860s. By the end of the war in 1865, there were 68
enclosed forts and batteries with emplacements for 1120 guns.
Because the sites provide an elevated circle of greenery, some were
acquired in the 1920s for a Fort Circle Drive park development that
was never constructed. The National Capital Region maintains 17
Fort Circle sites in the District of Columbia, one in Maryland and
one in Virginia. These sites are within the boundaries of three
parks: ROCR, NACE, and GWMP.

Archeological survey and inventory of the Fort Circle Parks is
insufficient to ensure that archeological resources under NPS
stewardship are conserved, protected, preserved in situ and managed
for long-term scientific research and for appropriate public
interpretation and education. Information about the location,
characteristics and significance of the majority of archeological
resources is lacking. This lack of information seriously impairs
the ability of park managers, planners, interpreters, law
enforcement officers and other specialists to carry out their
responsibilities.

EVALUATION OF THE SHORELINE CHANGES OF POTOMAC AND ANACOSTIA RIVERS
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Since the establishment of the Federal City in the 1790s, there has
been a great deal of alteration of the natural landscape.
Infilling of marshlands and creation of artificial land in
particular have altered the shoreline. Such changes affect the
archeological potential of a great deal of land within the National
Capital Area. The identification of land areas which, for example,
could not have been occupied before they were created in the mid-
19th-century, will be a valuable planning tool for siting park
development needs and visitor services in several parks. Affected
land is within the boundaries of four parks: NACC, NACE, GWMP, and
ROCR.

DESCRIPTION OF RECOMMENDED PROJECT OR ACTIVITY: [for any of above
three types of Problems}

It is planned to conduct systematic scientific research to locate,
evaluate, and document archeological resources. The project
includes an overview and assessment of existing information on
prehistoric and historic resources; a field survey and Phase II
test excavations to locate, identify, evaluate, and document
archeological resources using the criteria of significance
established by the National Register of Historic Places; analysis
of the data; artifact processing, cataloging, and stabilization;
and report preparation; printing, and distribution. The documents
produced as a result of this project include an Archeological
Overview and Assessment and an Archeological Identification and
Evaluation Study. These documents, including an archeological base
map, will provide information needed by park managers, planners,

VI. PROJECTS IN PRIORITY ORDER

SYSTEMWIDE ARCHEOLOGICAL INVENTORY PROGRAM PRIORITIES

In the SAIP document (NPS 1992) Systemwide Program Priorities are
listed by their factor numbers 1-7, which are intended to be non-
hierarchical. These factors are given priorities in this plan and
are listed in that order below. An additional regionwide factor
for the National Capital Area has been added as the first priority
factor.

Ranking of
Priority

Factor

vi.

1.

Park units which are particularly visible for
political or strategic reasons within the National
Capital Area are assigned a high priority.

Schedules for archeological inventory projects are
coordinated with schedules for development or
revision of park planning documents, particularly
General Management Plans, Resource Management
Plans, Development Concept Plans, and interpretive
Prospectuses. (Factor 1)

Park areas lacking virtually any information about
the presence or absence of archeological resources
should be assigned a high priority for preparation
of an Archeological Overview and Assessment.
(Factor 6)

Park areas that have suffered from, or are likely
to be threatened by, the destructive effects of
natural processes or human activities are assigned
a high priority for archeological inventory.
(Factor 2)

Development zones and special use zones within a
park area should be assigned a high priority for
archeological inventory. (Factor 3) [this factor
seems to be a special case of factor 2.]

Archeological inventory projects that address
research questions, problems, topics, or priorities
of State, regional, or national importance should
be assigned a high priority. (Factor 5)

The priority of an archeological inventory project
should consider the potential for archeological
resources being present and the likelihood of being

PROJECT PRIORITIES 291


=== Page 322 ===

able to locate (or discover) archeological
resources. (Factor 7)

8. Historic zones within parks and entire park units
that, by statute, are automatically listed in the
National Register of Historic Places because of
their archeological or historic importance should
be assigned a high priority for archeological
inventory. (Factor 4)

Table VI.1 divides the SAIP projects for the National Capital Area
into four priority categories. Within each category, parks are
listed by the order in which they should be surveyed if funds for
survey are limited. This ranking is based upon the above priority
factors. It should be understood that these categories and
priorities are suggestions based on currently available information
as explained below. It is possible, indeed likely, that these
priorities will change as park needs and circumstances change.

Priority #1 Archeological Survey Projects

Survey projects in this category are in parks which combine several
of the Systemwide and high priorities as listed above. They are
highly visible, have major planning documents either being
implemented or scheduled, have little archeological information but
high research interest and high likelihood of data resulting from
archeological survey.

ANTI. ANTI is in the process of implementing its GMP. There is
very little archeological information for the park. Archeological
resources are threatened by looting. The park holds high research
interest for historical archeology in particular and there is a
strong likelihood of gathering useful data.

VI. PROJECT PRIORITIES 292


=== Page 323 ===

MANA. A new GMP for MANA will be written beginning in FY95,
providing a good opportunity to correlate some of the archeological
research with the planning process. While there is some high
quality archeological survey data for sections of the park, some
areas have not been surveyed and some others have not been surveyed
adequately. Archeological resources are threatened by looting. The
park holds high research interest for historical archeology in
particular and there is a strong likelihood of gathering useful
data.

Fort Circle Parks. There are Fort Circle Parks in NACE, ROCR, and
GWMP. A GMP is being planned for the Fort Circle Parks, providing
a good opportunity to correlate some of the archeological research
with the planning process. There is little archeological
information for these areas. Archeological resources are threatened
by looting. These parks hold high research interest for historical
archeology in particular and there is a strong likelihood of
gathering useful data.

CHOH. There are four DCPs called for in the GMP; each of these
will be underway soon if not already nearing completion. These DCPs
are for Cumberland, Hancock, Williamsport, and Brunswick. The
archeological survey work on the C&O Canal is divided here into
three sections. The first, from Georgetown to Point of Rocks,
covers 50 miles in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont. Brunswick is in
this easternmost section. The second, from Point of Rocks to
Hancock, stretches for 75 miles in the Blue Ridge and Great Valley.
Both Williamsport and Hancock are in this middle section. The
third, from Hancock to Cumberland, covers 60 miles in the Ridge and
Valley province. Cumberland is in this westernmost section.

There is some good archeological data for CHOH, particularly from
site excavations. However, there has been very little systematic
survey. Archeological resources are threatened by looting. This
park holds high research interest for both prehistoric and
historical archeology and there is a strong likelihood of gathering
useful data. The CHOH is especially interesting archeologically
because it passes through several physiographic regions and
therefore provides good comparative data for floodplain use.

MONO. A DCP was recently completed for the Bush Tract at MONO and
there is intended development for the planned move of the
Williamsport Training Center to this area of the park. Population
is increasing rapidly in Frederick County and, particularly with
recent land acquisitions, MONO is becoming a more visible part of
the area. The farms that make up and are adjacent to land owned in
fee have long been favorites places for artifact collectors.
Increased visitation, increased park visibility and looting combine
to threaten archeological resources. There is little archeological
information for the park. MONO holds high research interest for

VI. PROJECT PRIORITIES 293


=== Page 324 ===

both prehistoric and historical archeology and there is a strong
likelihood of gathering useful data.

ROCR. A GMP is scheduled for ROCR, providing a good opportunity
to correlate some of the archeological research with the planning
process. The work at Fort Circle parks will provide some
information within ROCR. Some areas of the park have good
archeological data, but there is relatively little archeological
information for the remainder of the park. ROCR holds high research
interest for both prehistoric and historical and there is a strong
likelihood of gathering useful data.

PRWI. The GMP for PRWI should be approved in FY95 and then
implementation will begin. Land transfers also are planned. There
is an Overview and Assessment for this large park, providing good
background historical research. There is a lack of field data,
however.

Shoreline Study of Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. The planning
information that this project will produce will benefit four
National Capital Area parks. It will allow an informed assessment
of erosional as well as developmental threats to cultural resources
along the shorelines and will provide important detailed
information on the development of the waterfront.

Priority #2 Archeological Survey Projects

The projects in this priority category are, for the most part, in
parks without major planning currently scheduled. The areas
covered have little archeological information but high research
potential.

CATO. There is some archeological information for the immediate
area but little for the park itself. The research potential is
relatively good, in spite of the eroded condition of the land,
which somewhat limits the likelihood of useful data for much of the
land. The presence of rockshelters in the park, however, is
promising for intact archeological deposits.

GWMP - GRFA. While this area has high research potential and the
likelihood of good data recovery, portions have been surveyed,
albeit not to current professional standards.

GWMP - Parkway south of Alexandria, including Mt Vernon Memorial
Parkway, Jones Point, and Fort Hunt. There is some development
planned for Dyke Marsh and Belle Haven. Portions of this part of
GWMP have had some archeological reconnaissance. While the status
of survey is inadequate and there is a likelihood of recovering
good data, there is more information than for many of the Priority
#1 project areas.

VI. PROJECT PRIORITIES 294


=== Page 325 ===

GWMP — Parkway north of Alexandria. Portions of this part of GWMP
have had some archeological reconnaissance and there is an Overview
and Assessment for the portion in Arlington County. While the
status of survey is inadequate and there is a likelihood of
recovering good data, there is more information than for many of
the Priority #1 project areas.

WOTR. There is a GMP in process for WOTR. The archeological
reconnaissance done for this park in 1978 called for a complete
survey, which has never been done. Therefore, there is some
information, although it is not complete enough to define the
research potential of this park.

Priority #3 Archeological Survey Projects

Priority #3 projects are for areas which tend to have some
archeological data, albeit insufficient for either management or
research purposes. Due to extensive damage to the land, some of
the areas are considered to have low potential to yield useful
data.

GWMP - ARHO. While this area has relatively high research
potential and the likelihood of good data recovery, it is under
very little threat.

NACE - FOWA, HAHA. There is some archeological information
available for both of these units. Much of the land within Harmony
Hall, however, has yet to be surveyed. The plateau above Fort
Washington is also in need of survey.

NACE - GREE, BWPKWY. An archeological reconnaissance was
completed for a large portion of the Baltimore-Washington parkway.
Although recent construction work has indicated that it was not
particularly complete, the information in it is superior to that
for many units. While Greenbelt Park has some research potential,
it is under very little threat.

NACE - Anacostia. In comparison to many park units, Anacostia has
relatively good information for planning provided by a recent
assessment. The development of Management Objectives for Anacostia
park and the transfer of some new lands to it from the District of
Columbia place this park within Priority Group #3 rather than #4.

Priority #4 Archeological Survey Projects

GWMP - Glen Echo, CBNHS. There is little potential for intact
archeological resources at Glen Echo. There has been some
exploratory work already at the Clara Barton House. The resurvey
of these units, therefore, is low priority.

VI. PROJECT PRIORITIES 295


=== Page 326 ===

NACE. These areas are included in this project: Capitol Hill
Parks, Frederick Douglass NHS, Kenilworth and Aquatic Gardens, Oxon
Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm, Oxon Run Parkway, and Suitland
Parkway. Except for the Frederick Douglass home, these areas have
received little archeological attention. However, some areas have
limited archeological potential and the areas are not under threat.

HAFE - Bolivar Heights and Elk Run, Short Hill, Armory Canal,
Armory Grounds, Camp Hill, Halls Rifle Works. There has been a
great deal of archeological work in the park, including two recent
surveys of large sections. Some portions of the park remain to be
surveyed. In comparison with other parks HAFE has had a great deal
ef archeological work done.

NACE - Piscataway. There has already been an archeological survey
of Piscataway park. Resurvey of land currently held in fee will be
necessary by the time projects in this category of priority are
undertaken. It is hoped that lands held in scenic easement will be
available for archeological survey as well.

NACC, WHSE,

The parks in NACC and the White House grounds are of very high
visibility, but for the most part do not have high archeological
potential due to the infilling of much of the land from swamp. The
Shoreline Study under Priority category #1 will provide much needed
information for the units within NACC,

VII. ESTIMATED COSTS FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS

For each archeological inventory project the estimated costs should
include the full range of anticipated expenses. Because costs vary
quite widely between in-house and contracted services, it is nearly
impossible to provide realistic estimates without knowing the
administrative structure of the project.

The SAIP document (NPS 1992:24) provides the following list of
types of expenses. Each project will have special needs. In some
cases, for example, required historical background research will be
extensive, while in others such research will already have been
carried out adequately. Some sites will require more costly field
methods. Deep testing on the Potomac floodplain, for example, is
more costly than metal detector survey on a Civil War battlefield.
Surveys and site investigations will require different sorts of
special studies. For example, a well-preserved prehistoric site
may provide the opportunity for blood residue analysis of stone
tools.

The broad categories which must be taken into account when planning
a budget are as follows:

1) personnel (e.g., permanent and temporary positions, contractors,
consultants, peer reviewers) ;

2) travel and per diem expenses;

3) equipment (e.g., computers, cameras, GIS, GPS, remote sensing
devices) purchases and leases, and subsequent maintenance and
repair;

4) supplies and materials;

5) special data acquisition (e.g., purchase of existing remote
sensed or digitized data);

6) special studies (e.g., pollen analysis, radiocarbon dating,
archeomagnetic studies, parasite, phytolith, macrofloral,
thermoluminescent studies, artifact stabilization) ;

7) office, laboratory, and storage space;

8) publication costs (e.g., scientific reports and books, non-
technical books and pamphlets) ;

9) attendance at professional meetings;

10) public outreach activities; and

11) any overhead costs,

Table VII.1 provides rough estimates for the cost of the SAIP
projects proposed in this plan. These estimates are based on the
long experience of the Regional Archeologist of the National
Capital Region, now the National Capital Area.

All estimated costs are in current year (FY95) dollars.
Costs per project year are in thousands of dollars.
