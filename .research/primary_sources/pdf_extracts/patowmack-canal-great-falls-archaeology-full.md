 On The Archaeology of Early
 Canals: Research on the
 Patowmack Canal in Great

 Falls, Virginia

 ABSTRACT

 The Patowmack Canal is an important artifact of early
 post-colonial development in the United States. Under
 construction in 1785 the canal system utilized the channel

 of the Potomac River in conjunction with five canals built
 to by-pass rapids and falls. This paper examines the
 historical context of this undertaking along with archaeo
 logical investigations at the Great Falls by-pass canal in
 Virginia. Archaeological excavations were employed to
 reveal the various technological elements of this first
 generation canal system. This technology is also shown to
 be a reflection of the institutional milieu which produced
 this artifact.

 Introduction

 For many years, historical archaeology was a
 discipline concerned, to a great degree, with the
 colonial past. Recently, however, many archaeol
 ogists have also turned toward study of the post
 colonial period. As research horizons have broad
 ened, archaeologists have been obliged to excavate
 and understand artifacts of early commercial and

 industrial development. This paper examines such
 an artifact, the Patowmack Canal, begun in 1785
 and completed in 1802.

 Construction of the Patowmack Canal was un

 dertaken by the Patowmack Company, chartered
 by the General Assemblies of both Maryland and
 Virginia, respectively, in 1784 and 1785. This
 infrastructure project was championed by George
 Washington, and it was he that served as the
 company's first president. According to the Acts
 and Resolutions of Virginia and Maryland, the
 project was to open and extend navigation on the
 Potomac River from the tidewater (Port of

 Georgetown) to the highest point practicable on the
 North Branch.

 This effort was the first extensive canal con

 struction attempted in the United States. Over the
 sometimes precipitous 218 mile-long Potomac
 River, safe navigation was to be provided where
 possible in the river channel itself through removal
 of bars and loose rubble, the blasting out of
 bedrock, and, in some cases, by constructing
 sluices or walled channels in shallow water. At

 certain locations, by-pass or skirting canals were
 necessary to overcome rapids or falls. From sur
 veys it was determined that there were five loca
 tions where such by-pass canals would be
 needed?House's Falls, Shenandoah Falls, Seneca
 Falls, Great Falls, and Little Falls (see Figure 1).
 At the latter two locations, Great and Little Falls,
 by-pass canals with locks were ultimately neces
 sary to overcome the drop of the river bed.

 Archaeological excavations were undertaken at
 the Great Falls by-pass canal which was completed
 by the Patowmack Company in 1802. This by-pass
 canal, the largest and most complex in the overall
 system, today contains, among its many features,
 some of the earliest surviving essentially intact
 canal locks. The remains of this by-pass canal are
 especially significant in that they represent the first
 generation of canal technology in this country.
 Extensive excavations were undertaken on the

 lower gate pocket of Lock 1 (this lock was com
 pleted by 1798) to recover the remains of the lock
 gates (Dent 1983). Earlier excavations undertaken
 by the National Park Service (Comer 1977; Ziek
 1979 and 1980) also provided additional informa
 tion on Lock 1 as well as on the canal prism and its
 various elements.

 The goals of this research are as follows. First,
 the major emphasis is on employing archaeology
 to rediscover and document early canal technol
 ogy. At present little is known about the technol
 ogy employed in the first generation of canals
 constructed in the United States. Written records

 are scarce. While some early European technical
 literature survives and was used to guide early
 canal builders, it is evident that conditions in this

 country were unique and often resulted in undoc
 umented experimentation and invention. Later ca

 Historical Context

 nal systems, such as the Chesapeake and Ohio Ca
 nal, Erie Canal, and others, have been archaeologi
 cally investigated but are artifacts of the second
 generation of canal building and cannot directly be
 compared to earlier efforts. The Great Falls by-pass
 canal of the Patowmack Company therefore repre

 sents an opportunity to archaeologically explore the
 genesis of canal technology in this country.

 Second, this research also examines the
 Patowmack Canal as an artifact of early commer
 cial and industrial development in post-revo
 lutionary times. The project was a precedent and
 many of its elements can be seen as a reflection of
 the institutional milieu within which the undertak

 ing was conceived and carried out. While the
 Patowmack Canal was a financial failure, it was a

 useful experiment (albeit unintended) in both a
 technological and developmental sense. By view
 ing the effort as a product of the times, one can
 begin to see how the many problems its builders
 faced and solved did ultimately create the proper
 environment for future successful transportation
 development in the United States.

 Canal construction for transportation purposes
 has been undertaken since ancient times. In En

 gland, the oldest known canal is an artifact of
 Roman times. Certainly, however, in England and
 on the continent, the period of greatest canal
 construction can be associated with the industrial

 revolution. Although industrial and commercial
 development in the United States somewhat lagged
 behind that of the Old World countries, canal

 building here had started before the end of the 18th
 century. Some canals were built east of the Appa
 lachians for the purpose of connecting various
 bodies of water. The South Hadley Falls Canal in
 Massachusetts and the Dismal Swamp Canal in
 Virginia were opened by 1794 (Hadfield
 1968:192). Both, however, were level water ca

 nals running from one body of water to another.
 Technologically, the greater challenge was to con
 struct canals with locks capable of allowing water
 craft to traverse elevated terrain. An ultimate goal
 of such a canal in the United States would be to

 cross the Appalachian Mountains thus linking the
 Atlantic Coast with the western interior.

 Various plans and schemes had been advanced,
 as early as 1749, for transforming the Potomac
 River into such a transportation artery. The
 Patowmack Company, however, was the first sus
 tained effort at building a permanent transportation
 network that would link the east coast of the

 United States with the trans-Appalachian western
 interior (see Bacon-Foster 1912; Littlefield 1979;
 Torres-Reyes 1970 for complete histories of this
 company). This project marked the beginning of a
 national redefinition. Stagnation was inevitable
 without expansion and instead of looking only
 toward reestablishing trade with England, the
 young post-revolutionary nation was set to unify
 itself and tap the riches of its own frontier.

 laden, or who wants land to cultivate, may repair thither and
 abound, as in the Land of Promise, with milk and honey:
 the ways are preparing, and the road will be made easy thro'
 the channels of the Potomac (cited in Metcalf 1982:112).

 While there is no need to cast doubt on such noble

 intentions, the venture also had other purposes that
 are a reflection of the institutional milieu within

 which this undertaking was conceived and carried
 out.

 The Patowmack Company was also a specula
 tive venture designed to produce profits for its
 investors. Funds generated by the gentry were
 employed in an effort to bind the Maryland and
 Virginia region to the markets and raw materials of
 the western interior. Washington, himself, suc
 cinctly revealed the contradiction between ideol
 ogy and reality when he wrote:

 The Patowmack Company was formed and pro

 moted by a cadre of individuals with political
 power and financial resources. Influential com
 pany officers, such as Washington and others,
 were successful in lobbying both the Maryland and
 Virginia legislatures for the necessary charter. This
 was no minor feat given local political rivalries and
 the lack of a strong federal government to support

 interstate projects. The company was to be funded
 by the issue of joint stock. The pay-as-you-go
 purchase plan, unfortunately, required only a min
 imal initial pledge for stock purchase. This ulti
 mately proved disastrous in the post-war economic
 climate when stock holders could often not make

 further installments (Littlefield 1985:4). As con
 struction costs doubled, the company was forced to

 turn to sponsoring lotteries and heavy borrowing.
 A critical reading of the surviving documentary
 record indicates two precepts were to guide this
 undertaking. There is little doubt that at least some
 of the forces behind the project, as witnessed by
 the passage below, saw the undertaking as part of
 a larger cause. Washington, in a letter to the
 Marquis de Lafayette, poetically stated:

 I wish to see the sons and daughters of the world in peace

 and busily employed in the more agreeable amusement of
 fulfilling the first and great commandment, Increase and
 Multiply: as an encouragement to which we have opened
 the fertile plains of the Ohio to the poor, the needy and the
 oppressed of the Earth; anyone therefore who is heavy

 We shall not only draw the produce of western settlers but

 the fur and peltry of the lakes also, to our ports (being the
 nearest and easiest of transportation) to the amazing in
 crease of our own exports, while we bind these people to a
 chain which will never be broken (cited in Fitzpatrick
 1938:188).

 The basic formula to accomplish this goal, of
 course, was to build a transportation system that
 would allow watercraft to pass safely over the
 Potomac River at a quicker pace and therefore at
 less cost than any other competing form of trans
 portation.

 The Potomac River was recognized as one of the
 shortest routes to the waters of the Ohio River from

 any part of the Atlantic Coast. It was also central to
 the original 13 states and adjacent to politically
 powerful Virginia (Littlefield 1979:6). Once orga
 nized the Patowmack Company set about opening
 up navigation of the Potomac River. As stated
 earlier, the plan was to clear the natural river
 channel and utilize it wherever possible. At five
 locations, however, by-pass canals would be nec
 essary to avoid rapids or falls (Figure 1). In most
 instances the company was able to complete its
 obligations without undue difficulty. The excep
 tion to this rule proved to be the construction of
 by-pass canals with locks at Little Falls and Great
 Falls. Little Falls was finally circumvented in 1795
 with the construction of wooden locks that over

 dictate a by-pass canal with at least several locks.
 Excavations of the by-pass prism had begun in
 1786. By 1794 work could proceed no further
 without setting the locks. With Lock 1 completed
 in 1798, the company became financially insol
 vent. When funding became available again in
 1800, work resumed and the remaining four locks
 were built in short order. All locks were ready for
 gate installation in December of 1801. And the
 entire transportation system was finally operating
 in February 1802.

 By the standards of the time, the project was a
 technological marvel. The Patowmack Canal al

 River. The elevation overcome by this system was
 over three times that of the much later Erie Canal.

 As early as 1929 local officials recognized the
 significance of this artifact. In 1969 the by-pass
 canal at Great Falls was declared a National

 Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. It is also a
 Virginia State Landmark and is included on the
 National Register of Historic Places. Most recently
 it has been declared a National Historic Landmark.
 The remainder of this article will focus on the most

 notable feature of the system, the Great Falls
 by-pass canal, and on the archaeological excava
 tions at that location.

 Great Falls By-Pass Canal

 As completed in 1802, after 17 years of labor,
 the Great Falls by-pass canal was 3600 feet long.
 From upstream entrance to downstream exit this

 untrained personnel with little or no formal knowl
 edge of hydrology or canal engineering.

 Unfortunately, the undertaking was never a
 financial success. A series of severe droughts
 shortly after its completion allowed the system to
 sometimes only operate about 45 days of the year.
 For this and other reasons, the entire transportation
 system remained officially in operation only until

 by-pass canal overcomes an elevation drop of 76 3A
 feet. The remains of this canal are perhaps the best
 surviving example of early canal technology. In
 this section of the paper a detailed description of its

 features, based on field surveys and archaeological
 excavations, will be presented. The reader may
 refer to Figure 2 for a map of the works.

 At the upstream end of the by-pass canal the first
 feature encountered was a wing-dam which once

 angled out from the entrance of the waterway to a
 low-lying island in the Potomac River. A major
 concern, given the frequent droughts in the area,
 was to insure a constant supply of water for the
 works. This wing-dam originally consisted of a
 timber crib filled with large stones. It forced some
 of the stream flow into the by-pass canal and
 allowed excess water to run over its top and escape
 downstream. Another function was to ease turbu

 lence around the entrance, thus allowing watercraft
 to maneuver into the by-pass canal.

 The actual by-pass canal prism was 12 feet wide
 at the bottom and 30 feet wide at the top (Comer

 1977:53). This prism was 6 feet deep, and a water
 depth of 4 feet was the norm. In most prisms
 standard practice was to coat the prism bed with a
 mixture of clay and sand, known as puddle, to
 preclude water percolation through the bottom.
 Trenches were usually also filled with this puddle
 in the canal banks. This technique was first per
 fected by the great English canal builder, James
 Brindley (Burton 1972:89). Archaeological exca

 vations, however, indicate that no puddle, either
 lining the bottom or in the form of puddle gutters,
 was present (Comer 1977:59). The builders appar
 ently realized that such features were not necessary
 given the fact that water-charged bedrock formed
 the prism base. This bedrock also further served to

 recharge the by-pass canal prism with groundwa
 ter. Archaeological excavations also indicate a
 gravel revetment was installed on the banks of the
 prism to minimize wave-action damage (Comer
 1977:20-21).

 Approximately 700 feet down the by-pass canal
 a small stream, Mine Run, was captured to provide
 an additional source of water for the system. Some

 210 feet further down the by-pass canal the first
 relief mechanism was encountered. This consisted

 of a spillway that allowed surplus water to exit the
 prism and flow back toward the Potomac River.
 The spillway, actually a low masonry dam built
 into the prism wall, was 25 feet wide.

 Slightly further down the by-pass canal a guard
 gate was placed. The purpose of this mechanism

 was to allow operators to stop the flow of water
 into most of the by-pass canal for maintenance
 purposes and to also restrict water flow in periods
 of flood. Concern for possible flood water damage
 was evident with construction of large masonry
 retaining walls built of dry-laid stone on both sides
 of the upper by-pass canal prism. This upstream
 end of the canal had to withstand the brunt of force

 industries as well as storehouses, domestic struc
 tures, inns, and Patowmack Canal Company of
 fices. The most extensive archaeological excava
 tions of this location were completed by Southside
 Historical Sites (Barnes 1978; Troup 1979a, 1979b
 and 1979c; Troup and Barnes 1979; Troup,
 Barnes, and Barka 1978 and 1979).

 The first lock was located a short distance below

 delivered by seasonal floods. Another spillway
 was placed approximately 550 feet downstream
 from the guard gate as an additional relief mecha
 nism.

 Further downstream, from the spillways and
 guard gates, two late 18th century industrial oper
 ations drew water from the by-pass canal prism. A
 flume was once present to feed a grist mill (later
 converted to a sawmill) erected by Samuel Briggs.
 Slightly further downstream an iron forge, oper
 ated by John Potts and William Wilson, also
 removed water to power a trip-hammer. Archaeo
 logical excavations indicate the masonry walls of
 the canal prism were narrowed in this area to
 restrict available water, thus maintaining an ac
 ceptable depth (Comer 1977:61). Such a practice
 helped to compensate for water drawn off from the

 prism by the mill and forge. Archaeological testing
 at both the mill and forge was undertaken by
 Southside Historical Sites (Troup, Barnes, and
 Barka 1978 and 1979).

 The next major feature of the by-pass canal was
 located at about its mid-point. Here a holding
 reservoir ponded water to supply the lift-locks
 below. The holding reservoir, based on excava
 tions (Comer 1977:58), was about 1175 feet long
 and 210 feet wide and had a mean water depth of
 a little over 9 feet. A spillway at its lower end
 allowed excess water to escape and also powered a
 sawmill. At the reservoirs extreme terminus a

 feeder gate let water travel to a lower reservoir.

 The nearby lower guard gate allowed water to flow
 directly to the first lock.

 The village of Matildaville was also located
 along the southern perimeter of the holding reser
 voir. General "Light Horse" Harry Lee speculated
 on this land, and the village was chartered in 1790.
 Although this settlement never met the expecta
 tions of its developer, it once contained several

 the lower guard gate of the holding reservoir. This
 lock was set by Leonard Harbaugh in 1797-98.
 Lock 1 was unique on the Great Falls by-pass canal
 given the dimensions of its chamber, 14 feet wide
 versus the standard 12 feet, and the fact that

 accommodations were made in the gate pocket for
 a guillotine type of sluice door. Its uniqueness was
 a reflection of a set of plans delivered by
 Harbaugh's predecessor, Christopher Myers, be
 fore his dismissal as well as of the experimental
 nature of canal building in this country at that point
 in time. More specific observations on Lock 1 will
 be offered in the next section of this article.

 Nominal specifications for all locks, based on field
 measurements, are given on Table 2.

 Lock 2 was reached by a passage through a short
 channel below Lock 1. The masonry walls of this
 lock are dressed Triassic sandstone, as are those of
 Locks 1 and 3, and reflect the standard width of 12

 feet. No allowances were made in the gate pocket
 for guillotine sluice doors and a letter written by an
 early visitor specifically points out that the newer
 butterfly type of door was installed on this and the
 lower three locks (cited in Metcalf 1982:116). In
 short, a definite evolution in canal technology is
 evident between Locks 1 and 2.

 Below Lock 2, the prism entered the tripartite

 combination of Locks 3,4, and 5. By linking these
 three locks the need for one set of gates (2) was
 eliminated. A disadvantage of such linked sys
 tems, however, was water loss, especially for
 watercraft travelling upstream. To compensate for

 this water loss, a lower holding reservoir, fed by
 water from the upper reservoir, but by-passing
 Locks 1 and 2, was constructed. Water from this

 lower holding reservoir was diverted directly into
 Lock 3, thus insuring an adequate water supply for
 the three-lock combination.

 Lock 3 also had a chamber that was wider at the

 This feature compensated for a 20 degree bend in

 probably the result of the constant realignment of

 is unique for this country.

 Locks 4 and 5 were the most spectacular on the
 by-pass canal system. Both were cut and blasted
 directly into natural bedrock. This latter activity
 involved the first extensive use of black powder for
 excavation purposes in the United States. Each of
 these two locks had a tremendous lift (see Table 2)
 and each was set some 47-65 feet into solid
 bedrock. Bedrock formed the walls, or cheeks, of

 the locks, with masonry added at the points where
 gate apparatus was needed.

 After exiting Lock 5, the last at the Great Falls
 by-pass canal, a watercraft would have overcome
 an elevation drop of 76 3A feet from the upstream
 entrance, thus avoiding the cataract within the
 gorge. The watercraft would be eased back into the
 Potomac River behind the protection of a small
 wing-dam built to lessen water turbulence. It
 would then travel downstream to the Little Falls

 works, pass through, and eventually arrive at the
 tidewater port of Georgetown (now part of the
 District of Columbia) or possibly move further
 down the Potomac River to Alexandria, Virginia.
 Most of these watercraft were broken up for their

 In 1979 the National Park Service made the
 decision to stabilize and desilt Locks 1 and 2 on the

 Great Falls by-pass canal (Ziek 1979). When
 sediment was removed from the lower gate pocket
 of Lock 1, the partial remains of the guard gates
 were encountered. An exploratory excavation to
 determine the extent and condition of the gate
 remains was undertaken shortly thereafter (Ziek
 1980). Preliminary findings indicated that the
 lower portions of the gates along with the miter-sill
 had survived. It was also determined that desilting
 had disturbed the site environment enough that the
 wooden gates and associated artifacts were in
 danger of decay and eventual destruction.

 With the support of the National Park Service,
 the University of Maryland at College Park, De
 partment of Anthropology, undertook the excava
 tion and recovery, under the direction of the
 author, of guard gate apparatus. Lock 1, com
 pleted in 1797-98, is the earliest known surviving
 example of such an engineering feature. Although
 the gate remains discovered were not completely
 intact, it was thought that the recovery of those
 portions remaining and the resulting analysis of

 these objects would still provide invaluable infor
 mation on early canal design, construction, and
 operation.

 Exploratory tests within Lock 1 indicated soil
 matrix extended to a depth of 3 to 4 feet. Plans
 called for excavation of a 40 x 14 foot area within

 the interior of Lock 1. Excavation was by natural
 stratigraphic layers, and all artifacts recovered
 were plotted in their exact position with elevations
 below site datum also provided. A gasoline pump
 and siphon hoses were utilized to keep the canal as
 dry as possible. As excavations proceeded a de
 tailed photographic documentation of the effort
 was undertaken. Soil samples were also collected
 and analyzed in order to understand depositional
 processes. Complete architectural drawings were
 also produced for the entire lock structure as well
 as gate remains.

 When excavations were complete, the remains
 of the guard gates and the miter sill which the gates
 butted up against were recovered. A plan view of
 the gates and miter sill in situ is included on Figure

 3, and Figure 4 illustrates elevations of the guard
 gate remains. A detailed discussion of these arti
 facts can be found in Dent (1983); all objects
 recovered are currently undergoing conservation.

 Each guard gate recovered is 9.4 feet wide from
 the hinge post (where it was secured to the lock
 walls) to the miter post (where it joined the
 opposite gate). Structurally, these gates were

 planks, cut in random widths, from yellow pine
 (Lamb 1980:1). Everything seems to have been
 coated with pitch to halt decay. John Sullivan
 (1824:39) indicates such coating techniques were
 adopted from the wood preservation experiments
 of the British Navy. The major horizontal and
 vertical members were pit-sawn and then joined
 with mortise-and-tenon joints. An exception to this
 method of dressing was the hinge post which
 retained part of the circular shape of the original
 log.

 All major horizontal timbers were tapered to

 After the gates were removed, the miter sill,
 which formed a stop for the guard gates, was

 recovered. This unit (Figure 5), also cut from
 white oak, was 15 feet wide at the downstream
 edge and culminated in a triangular apex upstream.

 with what appears to be tar paper. The separation
 of wood by sheathing was believed to inhibit
 fermentation and rot (Sullivan 1824:40). Major
 timbers were fastened by mortise-and-tenon joints
 and spiked together in three discrete layers. The
 entire assembly fit into notches cut in the lock
 walls and was also anchored into bedrock.

 Evidence suggests Lock 1 was planned and built
 circa 1797-98. Harlan Unrau (1976:5) notes it was

 probable that there were only 20 reference works
 known in the United States by 1819 that dealt, at
 least in part, with canal engineering. With Lock 1
 completed over two decades before this date, an
 even smaller corpus of literature was available to
 the builders of the Patowmack Canal. In addition

 to recovering artifacts of this early canal project, it
 is also possible to examine European technological
 transfer to the Patowmack Company project and
 acceptance or modification in this context.

 The earliest and only known cartographic repre
 sentation of design features associated with the
 Patowmack Canal was produced by Thomas

 Johnson, an investor and officer of the company,
 in 1785 (Figure 6). While Johnson's sketches were
 proposals, they illustrate guard gates and a miter
 sill of standard European design. Similar gates and
 miter sills are illustrated in the standard European
 reference works of the time written by Charles
 Vallancey (1763), John Phillips (1792), Robert
 Fulton (1796), and the compilers of the Encyclo
 pedia Britannica (1771).

 Excavations at Lock 1 indicate that Johnson's

 proposals, mirroring European technology, were
 followed closely in the design of the lock. The
 miter sill recovered was a facsimile of Johnson's

 plans and the gates were close copies. Guillotine
 sluice doors, which slide up and down instead of
 pivoting, were employed as evidenced by allow

 into the lock walls to allow watercraft to enter and

 exit the lock. The unique 14 feet width of lock one,

 width of locks two through five at Great Falls.

 Indications are that the guard gates recovered
 through these excavations are not the originals but
 were installed just prior to 1821. An 1819 com
 pany report states the original guard gates at Great
 Falls were deteriorating (Bacon-Foster 1912:216),
 and a letter written in 1821 implies all guard gates
 had been replaced (Bacon-Foster 1912:221). Re
 pairs on these guard gates were undertaken in
 1827-28 (Patowmack Company Annual Report of
 1828). Added support braces were present on the
 east gate and probably are an artifact of these
 repairs. Cut nails in the guard gates also post-date
 1790 and are a further indication that the gates
 recovered were 1820-21 replacements. Hardware
 present on the gates indicates the original guillo
 tine sluice doors had been replaced by butterfly
 doors which pivoted instead of lifted. This butter
 fly type of sluice door was easier to operate and,
 based on its presence on other locks at the Great
 Falls works, was available by the very early 19th
 century.

 Conclusion

 The research reported on through this article has

 been concerned with archaeological excavations at
 the Patowmack Company's Great Falls works and
 the institutional milieu under which the project was
 conceived and carried out. In an ideological sense
 this canal system has always been viewed as an
 important artifact of early post-colonial develop
 ment given its first-of-a-kind nature and George
 Washington's association with the project. This
 research, however, illustrates that its importance
 goes beyond such a limited perspective. The
 Patowmack Company was both a precedent and
 unintended laboratory for infrastructure develop
 ment in this country. A critical evaluation of its
 successes and failures is best approached from the
 standpoint of the development of early canal tech
 nology as well as early transportation development
 in the United States.

 In summary, excavations at Lock 1 allowed the

 recovery of unique artifacts and data on early canal
 construction and operation. With Lock 1 designed
 before 1797 it is evident that European technology
 influenced its construction. However, this lock

 assembly also fits into a continuum of experimen
 tation with available technology when viewed in
 relationship to other locks on the Patowmack
 Canal system. Lock widths were gradually de
 creased to fit the circumstances of water transpor
 tation in this country, and as new innovations,
 such as improved sluice doors became available,
 they were rapidly incorporated into the system.
 After the initial success with this lock, the
 Potowmack Company engineers seemed even
 more willing to experiment with new technology in

 the remaining four locks on the Great Falls works.
 While the guard gates recovered from Lock 1 were
 not the originals, they still remain the earliest
 known examples of canal guard gates. Their con
 struction date of 1820-21 indicates such objects in

 Archaeological excavations have provided a
 window through which the genesis and evolution
 of first generation canal technology may be
 viewed. While some European technology did
 transfer, there was also a large amount of experi
 mentation and innovation. Canal prisms were built
 without features that most engineers saw as neces
 sary, and locks were set with greater lifts than
 European engineers of the time thought possible.
 Lock designs were sometimes so unconventional
 that many feared they would not operate. The very
 idea of clearing a natural river channel and only
 by-passing major obstacles was, in itself, a redef
 inition of traditional European canal transporta
 tion.

 Some of this technological experimentation and
 innovation can be seen as a reflection of the
 institutional milieu within which its creators

 worked. Wallace (1982:149-154) correctly points
 out that entrepreneural environments create situa
 tions where speculative efforts are directed toward

 completing the task at hand rapidly and often in a
 non-traditional manner. Sheer natural obstacles,

 unique to this country, also dictated a different
 canal technology.

 Much of the canal technology which was em
 ployed on the Patowmack Company system was
 successful. The Great Falls by-pass canal, for
 example, was a technological triumph that caused
 visitors of the time to stand in awe at the effort it

 represented and the physical obstacles it overcame.
 Unfortunately, however, the use of the natural
 river channel in the system was a risk that proved
 disastrous. For much of the transportation system's
 life, it could only operate for about 45 days a year
 due to low water in the Potomac River's upper
 channel. This mistake would be corrected in later

 canal projects with the construction of still-water
 canals with separate dedicated channels.

 The organization of the Patowmack Company
 itself also held important lessons for future trans
 portation systems. Joint-stock undertakings, such
 as the Patowmack Company, could not carry out
 major internal improvements without substantial
 and reliable government aid. A strong federal
 government would also be needed to handle inter
 state politics. The obstacles encountered by the
 Patowmack Company did much to encourage a
 Federalist vision of a country united by a well
 integrated, government supported system of inter
 nal commerce and transportation (Littlefield
 1985:4). The Patowmack Company also illustrated
 that transportation systems would be most success
 ful when they were built to connect already exist
 ing markets. The Patowmack Company, unfortu
 nately, connected two regions before a strong
 demand for either region's products was in exis
 tence. This did much to limit revenue, through
 tolls, to the system (Littlefield 1985:3).

 In closing, the Patowmack Company and its
 transportation system represents one of the grand
 est experiments of the age. Although the lessons
 learned were harsh, ultimately turning construction
 into a 17 year ordeal, the undertaking was the
 beginning of ambitious infrastructure development

 in this country. The project also united two regions

 for the first time and did much to help develop the
 young country's self-image. While the Patowmack

 Company itself was not a total success, the vision
 of the project and its sponsors was ultimately
 fulfilled by later canal systems.
