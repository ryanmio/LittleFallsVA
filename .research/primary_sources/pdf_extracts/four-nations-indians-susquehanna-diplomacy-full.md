the “four nations of indians upon the 

susquehanna”

mid-atlantic murder, diplomacy, and political 
identity, 1717–1723

Paul Douglas Newman
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown

abstract: In the wake of the first murder of an Indian by two Pennsylvania colonists 
in  1722,  the  Delaware  (Lenape),  Shawnee,  Conoy  (Piscataway),  and  Conestoga 
(Susquehannock/Mingo)  Indians  engineered  a  confederated  diplomatic  and  politi-
cal identity to defend their homeland. They styled themselves the “Four Nations of 
Indians upon the Susquehanna” to counteract the “Covenant Chain” devised by the 
Iroquois and colonial governments. Anthropologists have identified “ethno-genesis” 
wherein peoples from multiple Indian cultures wracked by epidemics intertwined to 
form wholly new cultures and nations. This, however, is a story of “politico-genesis.” 
These four nations retained their individual languages and governing structures while 
living  in  multinational  or  adjacent  towns  and  joined  together  to  present  a  single 
diplomatic voice to the English government and the Iroquois League who sought to 
control them. This was an early and significant attempt at political and diplomatic 
confederation that Indian peoples would employ in centuries to follow.

the murder of sawantaeny, the land, and “politico-
genesis,” 1722

“My  Friends  have  killed  me!”  Sawantaeny,  the  Seneca  hunter  and  warrior, 
gurgled  his  last  words  through  the  blood  that  filled  his  throat  and  clotted 
the  bearskin  where  he  lay  dying.  It  was  late  January  1722  along  the  upper

reaches  of  the  Monocacy  River,  just  west  of  the  Susquehanna.  Moments 
before, Weenepeweeweytah, his Shawnee wife, had begged him not take his 
gun  from  the  cabin  but  Sawantaeny,  “in  liquor”  that  morning,  supposed 
that  Pennsylvania  traders  John  and  Edmund  Cartlidge  had  cheated  him. 
Determined to have his fair share of rum, the aggrieved Seneca hunter waved 
his  empty  liquor  pot  demanding  his  due.  When  Sawantaeny  approached 
John,  Cartlidge  smacked  the  pot  from  the  Seneca’s  hand  and  shoved  him 
to  the  ground.  An  upward  branch  from  a  fallen  tree  opened  a  gash  across 
Sawantaeny’s throat.1

The Cartlidges—men in the employ of Pennsylvania Provincial Secretary 
James  Logan,  who  ran  his  own  trading  and  land  speculation  operation—
were purchasing deerskins with blankets or “match coats,” “strouds” of linen 
or  wool,  flints,  lead,  powder,  knives,  foodstuffs,  and  metal  tools.  In  these 
deals, Sawantaeny, the Iroquois upriver, and the lower Susquehanna Indians 
became increasingly dependent on traders, their goods, and rum. Rum led 
Sawantaeny to bring out his gun. After John Cartlidge threw the Seneca to 
the ground, William Wilkins, the Cartlidges’ indentured servant, struggled 
with Sawantaeny for the gun until Edmund Cartlidge tore it from his hands. 
Edmund raised the weapon and brought the butt down first on Sawantaeny’s 
shoulder, crushing his clavicle, and then struck him over the head once, and 
again, and a third time. The gun broke in two and so did Sawantaeny’s skull. 
He  slumped  to  the  ground  but,  somehow,  managed  to  sit  upright.  Upon 
hearing  the  commotion,  John  Cartlidge  “stript  off  his  clothes,”  strode  up 
to the cabin, “kick’d the Indian on the side,” and punched him in the face. 
He then ordered two Shawnee boys, Acquanachke and Metheequeyta, aides 
to Ayaquachan, the Cartlidges’ Conoy guide, to carry Sawantaeny into the 
cabin. There the hunter voiced his last words to his sobbing wife, lingered 
on, and then died a day later.

By that time, Sawantaeny’s “Friends” had moved on, collecting more skins 
and furs, and distributing more goods and rum. He was right, though, they 
had been his “Friends.” This was the first interracial murder on Pennsylvania’s 
Susquehanna  borderland.  Moreover,  the  Cartlidges  were  not  “Loose  Idle” 
traders who sold only rum and earned Indian scorn. They were licensed mer-
chants and John was a Justice of the Peace for Chester County. They offered 
a variety of goods that Indians wanted and needed. Yet the Seneca’s friends 
had killed him indeed, beating him viciously even after they had disarmed 
him. More accurately they had murdered him. And his widow was the only 
one to mourn for Sawantaeny.2

Word of the murder traveled through Indian country quickly, back east 
to the Susquehanna towns and beyond, north to the Iroquois League of Five 
Nations,  which  included  the  Seneca.  Although  none  of  them  immediately 
sought  retribution  from  the  English. These  woods  were  a  dark,  confusing 
place.  In  Philadelphia  Governor  William  Keith  learned  of  the  death  from 
a butcher, Richard Langdon, who had overheard talk of the incident when 
at the Indian town of Conestogoe on the Susquehanna (south and west of 
present-day  Lancaster)  nearly  six  weeks  after  the  fact.  Keith  convened  his 
council, alerted the Assembly, and immediately dispatched Secretary Logan 
and Colonel John French to Conestogoe “with full powers to make inquiry” 
and “generally dispatch such message and take such other Measures . . . to 
secure the public Safety.”3

Sawantaeny  died  on  disputed  land.  Hunters  and  warriors  from  the 
Iroquois  League  had  been  using  Pennsylvania’s  Susquehanna  Valley  as  a 
“Warrior’s Path” to the Monocacy and Potomac rivers, and points south to 
raid  the  Carolina  Cherokees  and  Catawbas  for  more  than  a  decade.  The 
Haudenosaunee  League  was  a  political  confederation  of  “Five  Nations” 
Iroquois:  Sawantaeny’s  Senecas,  Cayugas,  Onondagas,  Oneidas,  and 
Mohawks from west to east, south of the Great Lakes of Erie and Ontario. 
Political confederation was a survival strategy during the “Beaver Wars” of the 
seventeenth century in which the Five Nations—sharing language, culture, 
and  an  ancestral  homeland—allied  together  against  the  French  and  their 
Native American allies and trading partners, including the Susquehannocks. 
In 1676 the Five Nations attacked the Susquehannocks who moved south to 
the Chesapeake’s western shore but never capitulated. Likewise, the Lenapes 
and Shawnees never acknowledged Iroquois conquest following similar raids 
intended to open direct trade with Maryland and Virginia. The League then 
dubiously  claimed  ownership  of  lands  south  to  the  Chesapeake  Bay  and 
Ohio River through claimed military conquests of the Lenapes, Shawnees, 
and the Susquehannocks. They then used those lands to supply pelts to trade 
with  the  English  for  needed  supplies  and  for  arms  to  defend  their  north 
and east against their French and Indian enemies. The English were happy 
to indulge the Iroquois fiction to have the beaver trade and a single real estate 
negotiator in the form of the League. The English bound themselves to the 
League, and the League then promised to force all of its conquered tributar-
ies to accept the terms of treaties brokered by the Iroquois and the English; 
that was the fictional “Covenant Chain” that claimed to bind Susquehanna 
Indians and others.4

the “four nations of indians”(cid:0)

By the time the Cartlidges murdered Sawantaeny in 1722, the Five Nations 
had added a sixth. The Tuscaroras were Iroquoians from the south who fled 
the Catawbas and Cherokees who would sell them into Carolinian slavery. 
These latter were the “Southern Indians” whom the Five Nations had used 
the  “Warrior’s  Path”  through  the  Susquehanna  to  raid  for  population-
replacing captives in their “Mourning Wars.” Though defeated in the 1711–13 
Tuscarora War, the Tuscaroras declared their independence from the Carolina 
slave trade by accepting an invitation from the Five Nations to move to the 
North Branch of the Susquehanna River and become the “Southern Door” 
defending  the  “Six  Nations.”  In  1722  the  colonies  and  the  Susquehanna 
Indians still referred to the League as the “Five Nations.”5

When  he  died,  the  Seneca  Sawantaeny  was  trading  on  land  claimed 
by  the  “Susquehanna  Indians”  comprised  of  four  nations:  the  Conestogas, 
Lenapes, Shawnees, and Conoys (the Piscataways formerly of Maryland). The 
Conestogas  were  Susquehannock  Iroquoian  speakers  who  had  returned  in 
1697 and claimed an ancestral right to the land. They named their rebuilt com-
munity on the river “Conestogoe Town.” During the Susquehannock absence, 
the Algonquin-speaking Lenapes moved into the Susquehanna Valley from the 
Delaware Valley. While the Lenapes watched the burgeoning English settle-
ments to their south on the Chesapeake and their northeast in New England, 
their Dutch and Swedish neighbors made only feeble attempts to settle while 
offering  valuable  trade. Though  in  1682  the  English  advance  meant  settlers 
were  coming  as  the  Lenapes  hemorrhaged  large  numbers  from  disease.  To 
retain their independence, they sold their lower Delaware Valley homeland to 
William Penn and removed to the Susquehanna Valley. The Lenapes claimed 
a right to the vacant Susquehanna lands through a “Chain of Friendship” or 
a “League of Friendship” made with William Penn in a 1682 treaty. They then 
welcomed  the  returning  Conestogas  in  1697,  as  well  as  Algonquin-speaking 
southern  allies  the  Conoys  and  Shawnees,  all  fleeing  English  settlement  in 
Maryland  and  Virginia.  Conestogas,  Shawnees,  and  Conoys  made  their 
covenant with Penn with the Great Treaty at Conestogoe in 1701, before an 
approving Lenape audience. The Five Nations could claim ownership of the 
valley and they did so by using their 1676 defeat of the Susquehannocks, but 
the Susquehanna Indians now had land transactions, written on parchment, 
some signed by William Penn, a powerful European ally.6

Yet in 1722, the Cayuga claimed that Penn had earlier promised to honor 
their  land  claims  in  the  lower  Susquehanna  Valley.  Penn  had  recognized 
the  Leagues’  ownership—not  the  Cayuga’s  individually—of  the  entire

Susquehanna Valley in the 1684 Albany Treaty that introduced Pennsylvania 
into  the  “Covenant  Chain”  between  the  League  and  the  English.  By  the 
end  of  the  next  decade  Penn  purchased  the  lower  valley  from  New  York’s 
Governor Dongan, who had purchased it from the League, but the Cayuga 
viewed these transactions more as leases than sales and now sought possession 
again.  Also  claiming  the  land  were  squatters  and  officials  from  the  colony 
of  Maryland.  Then  there  were  the  imagined  or  potential  claimants.  The 
French to the northwest, with their officials, traders, and Jesuit priests, eyed 
lucrative relationships with the Five Nations and the Susquehanna Indians. 
To counter them, Pennsylvania invited German settlers from the Schoharie 
Valley  in  New  York  to  the  Tulpehocken  area  in  the  Susquehanna  Valley 
in  1712,  followed  by  the  Scots  Irish.  Newcomers  squeezed  the  Conestogas, 
Lenapes, Shawnees, and Conoys who had established towns from south to 
north.  Conestogoe,  Shawnee Town,  Pequea,  Conoy Town,  Conodogwinet, 
and Paxton bustled on the lower Susquehanna, and the towns of Shamokin, 
Nescopeck, Wapwallen, and Wyoming hummed above the forks of the West 
and North branches (see fig. 1).7

Sawantaeny  likely  frequented  these  multi-ethnic  towns,  and  he  chose 
his wife from one of them. The Lenape—considered by all a “grandfather” 
people—spoke for the Susquehanna Indians in 1722 but Pennsylvania offi-
cials recognized Conestogoe town—an ancient ancestral place—as the seat 
of Susquehanna power. While one of the Four Nations dominated each of 
the towns, all towns had elements of each nation. They were multi–lingual-
national-cultural  communities.  Each  nation  retained  its  own  language, 
celebrated  its  own  cultural  traditions,  and  shared  political  leadership  con-
sensually  through  multinational  councils.  When  they  spoke  to  outsiders, 
though, they spoke with one voice. Through these towns and the strategy of 
confederation they succeeded in holding onto the valley for two decades after 
the Great Treaty with William Penn in 1701. They advocated for Provincial 
protections for one another’s territorial boundaries and attempted to dictate 
the terms of trade.

The  year  1722  was  pivotal  in  terms  of  power  brokerage,  in  which  the 
Susquehanna Indians, the Iroquois League, and the provincial governments 
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and New York all used the murder of 
Sawantaeny  on  contested  land  in  a  complex  diplomacy,  each  to  assert  its 
authority  over  the  Susquehanna  River  Valley.  After  the  Albany  Treaty  of 
1722—precipitated  by  the  murder  of  Sawantaeny—the  Iroquois  asserted 
the right to sell Susquehanna Valley land and the Pennsylvania government

asserted  the  right  to  colonize  it.  Between  1701  and  1722,  especially  since 
European  settlers  began  pressing  into  the  valley,  the  Susquehanna  Indians 
employed a novel political and diplomatic strategy to assert their independ-
ence and sovereignty over their land. They engaged in “politico-genesis.”

Historians  and  anthropologists  have  often  referred  to  the  phenomenon 
of  “ethno-genesis”  among  Eastern  Woodland  Indians  who,  when  faced  by 
the  decimation  of  virgin-soil  epidemics  and  warfare  with  and  inspired  by 
Europeans,  regathered  in  multi-ethnic,  multilingual  communities  to  form 
new ethnicities, cultures, languages, and identities. The “Southern Indians,” 
the  Cherokee  and  the  Catawba,  are  prime  examples.  The  Susquehanna

Indians’  story  is  rather  a  tale  of  “politico-genesis.”  Faced  with  the  threats 
to  their  sovereignty  posed  by  settlers,  unscrupulous  rum  dealers,  colonies, 
European  empires,  the  Five  Nations,  and  by  the  Southern  Indians,  these 
“four nations” assumed a shared political identity. While in their towns they 
retained their ethnic identities, to the outside world they called themselves 
the  “Four  Nations  of  Indians  upon  the  Susquehanna.”  In  diplomacy  they 
spoke  in  one  voice. They  asserted  sovereignty  over  their  land  and  political 
independence  for  their  confederation  as  practical  survival  mechanisms,  all 
while retaining their individual national identities, languages, and cultures.8
They likely learned and imitated this technique from none other than 
the  Iroquois.  Unlike  the  Haudenosaunee  League,  the  Four  Nations  was 
ethnically,  linguistically,  nationally,  and  geographically  diverse:  they  did 
not share an ancestral home. Rather than language, culture, or ancestry it 
was their adopted homeland that defined the Susquehanna Indians. They 
formed a political and diplomatic identity in their shared sovereignty over 
and through that land. The Susquehanna land was theirs; while some had 
been burying their ancestors there for generations, most had just begun to 
do so after abandoning previous homelands. Even to the Susquehannocks it 
represented a new promise for the future. They would confederate there to 
make a diplomatic and political stand for sovereignty in the Susquehanna 
Valley.

By  1722  Pennsylvania’s  proprietors  and  traders  tenuously  held  onto  the 
Susquehanna Indians. First, the natives provided the colony valuable upriver 
furs and trans-montane deerskins. They formed a buffer against the French 
and  their northwestern Indian allies. Susquehanna Indians also served as a 
western  check  to  their  own  settlers  who  otherwise  would  have  spread  too 
quickly to squat in the west, forsaking eastern development and labor needs. 
The Pennsylvania proprietary government sought a slow, orderly subjection 
of the Susquehanna Valley residents, Indian and colonial settlers, to preserve 
the  native  trade  while  keeping  the  peace  to  attract  and  sell  more  land  to 
colonists.9

Colonial  settlement  in  1722  directly  threatened  Susquehanna  Indian 
sovereignty  over  the  land  on  their  eastern  frontier,  and  their  survival. 
Settlers  squatted  on  hunting  grounds  and  their  domesticated  animals 
destroyed Indian crops. Pigs, sheep, and cattle pushed off the game that 
Indians  relied  upon  for  food  as  well  as  trade  for  needed  English  goods. 
In addition to the settlers and their beasts, there were the traders. While 
the  Indians  appreciated  honest  merchants  who  followed  Pennsylvania

law,  they  resented  unscrupulous  traders  who  plied  alcohol  excessively 
to  ensnare  them  in  debt  and  economic  (and  substance)  dependency. 
Sovereignty meant freedom to farm their own land and to use their land 
to hunt game for sustenance, and access to trade with honest traders for 
needed  English  goods. Therefore,  sovereignty  meant  freedom  from  set-
tlers and dishonest rum dealers.10

By  assuming  the  “Four  Nations”  identity  the  Susquehanna  Indians 
declared  their  equality  with—and  independence  from—the  Five  Nations 
Iroquois  and  the  colony  of  New  York  to  the  north,  Pennsylvania  to  the 
east,  and  Virginia  and  Maryland  to  the  south.  The  construction  of  the 
Four  Nations  identity  was  a  logical  and  potentially  successful  tactic  of 
confederation  for  self-governance  and  self-preservation.  Sawantaeny’s 
murder  in  1722  and  the  diplomatic  machinations  at  Onondaga,  Albany, 
Williamsburg,  Philadelphia,  and  Conestogoe  represented  the  apex  of  the 
Susquehanna Indians’ Four Nations diplomatic and political strategy. That 
strategy would fail as Pennsylvania, with the assistance of the Five Nations, 
began a gradual ethnic cleansing the Susquehanna Valley in the four dec-
ades after 1722. It did not fail because the strategy was flawed, or because 
the Native Americans were not shrewd in their diplomacy. To the contrary, 
the  Four  Nations’  diplomatic  effort  was  extraordinary.  It  failed  because 
of the strength of the opposing forces—both Indian and provincial—and 
the conviction of the swarming colonists. It failed because of the equally 
shrewd  Iroquois  League’s  perpetuation  of  the  “Covenant  Chain”  myth 
of  Five  Nation  suzerainty  over  the  Four  Nations  and  their  Susquehanna 
homeland.  The  Lenapes,  Shawnees,  and  Conestogas  (who  with  western 
Senecas would become “Mingos”) who migrated west would resurrect, the 
confederated identity time and again for decades in “Allegheny Country.” 
They did so by declaring their independence from empires, colonies, and 
the Iroquois League in the westward-expanding place that Europeans called 
Pennsylvania.11

But  in  the  winter  of  1722  this  history  had  not  yet  transpired,  this 
Indian  defensive  tactic  was  new,  and  Governor  Keith  sought  to  hold  the 
Susquehanna Indians close, not drive them away, while slowly developing the 
land between their towns. The events that led him to send Secretary Logan 
and Colonel French to Conestogoe to meet the crisis of Sawantaeny’s murder 
in such uninvited haste began with another murder when he first took office, 
five years earlier in 1717, on the south side of the Potomac River, along the 
Warrior’s Path in Virginia.

the murder of owecheela’s son, 1717

In July 1717, and not long after his arrival in Philadelphia as the new governor 
of the colony, William Keith trekked through the woods to meet for the first 
time  with  the  Susquehanna  Indians  at  Conestogoe.  Keith  represented  the 
land  and  trade  interests  of  the  proprietor,  William  Penn,  and  he  instantly 
clashed  with  Provincial  Secretary  Logan  who  had  been  using  his  position 
to  serve  his  own  interests.  Logan’s  opponents  in  the  Assembly  suggested 
Keith make the trip, and Keith sought to use his position to compete with 
Logan for Native American trade and their lands. The Indians had sent for 
Keith, their direct connection to their friend, William Penn, and when he 
arrived, Keith asked them “what new matter had befall’n them, which had 
rendered them uneasy.” After some time, they answered that they wanted to 
know “What Christians were settled Back in the Woods behind Virginia & 
Carolina?” About two months before, Delaware Chief Owecheela, his three 
sons,  and  four  other  Susquehanna  Indians  had  been  hunting  south  of  the 
Potomac River in Virginia, when they encountered a “Large Company . . . 
about Thirty Christians, armed horsemen, & about as many Indians.” Some 
days  later,  while  hunting  separately  in  the  same  area,  one  of  Owecheela’s 
sons  heard  gunfire  and,  traveling  toward  the  sound,  “found  his  Brother 
shot  with  two  Arrows  in  his  side,  &  his  Head  Cut  off,  &  Carried  away.” 
The  Susquehanna  Indians  resented  the  murder,  but  also  worried  that  the 
Catawbas of the Carolinas, and western white settlers were moving north to 
hunt and settle in the Susquehanna Valley west of the river.12

Keith  well  understood  the  “new  matter”  even  before  the  Conestogoe 
chief  had  spoken.  He  introduced  to  them  a  Captain  Christopher  Smith, 
sent to Pennsylvania by Governor Spotswood of Virginia. Smith accused the 
Susquehanna Indians, particularly the Shawnees, of accompanying a Seneca 
war party on an attack against Catawba Indians at Virginia’s Fort Christianna, 
and of carrying away captives. Owecheela’s son had been killed by Catawbas 
in pursuit of retreating Seneca and Shawnee raiders in Virginia. The Shawnees 
admitted that six of their young men had taken part in the raid, but that they 
had no Catawba prisoners, save for a young boy taken “several years ago, when 
he was but a Little lad.” They further said that “he had now forgot his Native 
Language & spoke theirs” and they refused to return him. When Smith asked 
the boy through an interpreter if he was willing to return, the boy would give 
no answer. The Shawnees adopted him into their community and he likely 
identified himself as a Shawnee son and brother. The Seneca had persuaded

Shawnee warriors from the Susquehanna towns to join them on the Warrior’s 
Path  downriver  and  down  the  Blue  Ridge  to  attack  the  Southern  Indians. 
Interracial war had not come to the Susquehanna Valley or Pennsylvania in 
1717, but it was nearing.13

Governors  Keith  and  Spotswood  wanted  peace  on  their  frontiers,  and 
Keith  reminded  the  Susquehanna  Indians  of  “the  League  of  Friendship” 
created  by  their  “Great  Good  friend  &  Brother  William  Penn”  between 
the  English  and  them.  He  continued  the  metaphor  of  friendship  for  their 
diplomacy when he reminded them that “all the several Governments, from 
New England to South Carolina . . . are all subject to the Great King . . .  
which  means  all  the  Indian  nations  who  are  in  League  &  friendship  with 
any English Government must also be friends to each other.” Keith—new to 
Indian diplomacy—neglected to bring gifts for the Indians to demonstrate 
his good will and bind his egalitarian words. Nevertheless, the next summer 
the  Susquehanna  Indians  came  to  Philadelphia  for  the  Lenape Tagotelessa 
to  introduce  himself  as  the  new  “Chief  of  the  Conestogas”  with  the  name 
“Civility.” Civility had come to complain of abuses by settlers and traders at 
the native towns but prefaced his complaints by stating that he “with some 
of the young men had this Last spring some Inclination to Go out to war 
towards the Southward, but being put in mind that it would not be agreeable 
to this government . . . they Desisted.” After demonstrating his control of his 
warriors, and his commitment to Keith’s desire for peace, Civility complained 
that despite the colony’s promises, rum “is still carried in great Quantities . . . 
by Loose persons who have no fixed settlements.” Shecokkeneen, a Conestoga 
Chief  from  the  upriver  town  of  Paxton  (present-day  Harrisburg)  added 
that  his  people  “had  been  lately  so  generally  debauched  with  rum,  carried 
amongst them by strangers, that they now want all manner of Clothing & 
necessaries  to  go  a  hunting.”  Plus,  they  desired  that  only  traders  who  fur-
nished them “with all other necessaries” be allowed to bring them rum. They 
also complained of encroaching settlers and threatened to move out of the 
Susquehanna Valley farther away from the English.14

The  strange  traders  and  encroaching  settlers,  they  hinted,  came  from 
Maryland, Pennsylvania’s southern neighbor with a rival claim to the south-
ern Susquehanna River Valley. This “would be a means of carrying their peltry 
thither” if Governor Keith did not act soon. Keith promised to do all in his 
power to stem the flow of rum by “Loose Idle fellows” and to counteract the 
Susquehanna  Indians’  “willingness  to  retire  from  Conestogoe.”  He  offered 
that  fences  and  “Lines  should  be  Run  round  the  other  Indians Towns”  as

they had done for Conestogoe earlier “to secure them the more Effectually 
from Incroachments.” The chiefs of the Conestogas, Conoys, Shawnees, and 
Lenapes  agreed,  and  to  bind  their  words  they  presented  as  gifts  forty-nine 
deer skins and two bear skins. Keith reciprocated this time with powder, lead, 
tobacco,  and  clothing  valued  20  percent  higher  than  the  Indian  offering. 
Later that year, Logan undermined Keith by moving Mennonite immigrants 
from the Palatinate into the region to bolster his own growing business, set-
tling them just a few miles from Conestogoe in 1717. These Palatines joined 
Swiss  Brethren  who  had  been  settling  Pennsylvania’s  Susquehanna  frontier 
since  1712.  Presents  to  Susquehanna  Indians  did  not  guarantee  an  end  to 
white settlement, and they would not stop Five Nation warriors either.15

In  the  spring  of  1719  the  Iroquois  Five  Nations  once  more  attacked  the 
Catawbas  and  Virginia  Indians  at  Fort  Christianna  and  brought  captives 
back  with  them  as  they  traveled  home  up  the  Susquehanna.  On  May  20 
they stopped at Conoy Town, just above Conestogoe, and called for Chester 
County Justice of the Peace John Cartlidge—Sawantaeny’s killer three years 
later—and told him to inform the governor that “they had made a clear path 
to pass & repass to & from the Southward . . . and that they expected to have 
free  recourse  for  their  People  amongst  the  English  Plantations,  whilst  they 
were making war.” Not long after, a letter arrived in Philadelphia from the 
Conestogas  announcing  that  Southern  Indians  had  attacked  some  of  their 
hunters near the head of the Potomac River, saying “They have killed several 
of our people.”16

Governor  Keith  responded  via  a  letter  delivered  by  Colonel  French  on 
June 28, in which he warned them against being persuaded to go to war by 
the  Five  Nations.  He  also  condemned  the  Iroquois  for  torturing  to  death 
one of their Catawba captives, further warning the Susquehanna Indians not 
to  abide  such  a  “shameful  and  base  a  thing”  in  their  neighborhood  again. 
Civility  replied  that  he  was  glad  that  his  “young  People  were  at  home”  to 
hear these words, and that they would “agree to Obey the Governor’s Words 
and  Message.”  The  tenuous  peace  was  holding,  but  for  how  long?  The 
Susquehanna Indians felt squeezed on three sides: from the more powerful 
Iroquois  to  the  north;  the  Catawbas  and  Virginia  Indians  to  the  south; 
from  Virginia  frontiersmen;  “loose”  Maryland  traders;  and  Maryland  and 
Pennsylvania squatters from the south and east. To the northwest were the 
French  who  anticipated  drawing  Susquehanna  Indians  into  their  orbit  of 
trade. Living independently on the river that the Shawnees and Conoys had 
called home for two decades, the Lenapes for four, and the Conestogas for

cially if the chiefs lost control of their young men.17

the deaths of two shawnee warriors, 1720

In  June  of  the  following  year,  there  was  a  “Dispute  arising  among  some” 
young Shawnee men at Conestogoe about “Who was the best man.” To “end 
it they resolved to make the Trial by going out to War.” They “could not be 
restrained,” the Shawnee chief told James Logan at a meeting in Conestogoe 
on June 27, 1720, “but took the opportunity of accompanying some of the 
five Nations that were going” south to war. Catawba warriors killed two of 
the Shawnee young men on the raid into Virginia. Logan reprimanded the 
Susquehanna Indians for violating their agreement of the previous summer, 
to  which  Civility  replied  that  “this  they  thought  was  somewhat  too  hard 
upon them, if they must be confined as Prisoners at home, and could not go 
to meet their Enemies that came against them.” Civility then went further, 
to remind Logan and Pennsylvania that the Susquehanna Indians were their 
equals:

When  Governor  Penn  first  held  Councils  with  them,  he  promised 
them  so  much  Love  and  Friendship,  that  he  would  not  call  them 
Brothers, because Brothers might differ, nor Children because these 
might offend and require Correction, but he would reckon them as 
one Body, one Blood, one Heart, and one Head. One generation may 
die,  and  another  may  die,  but  the  League  of  Friendship  continues 
strong. . . . And this is not said on behalf of themselves, the Mingoes 
(Conestogas) only, but on behalf of all the Indians on the River, and 
they gave another Bundle of deerskins.

Civility thus reminded Logan of the “League of Friendship” they made with 
the recently deceased William Penn and made clear that his message repre-
sented something new.18

With  that  gift  “on  behalf  of  all  the  Indians  on  the  River,”  Civility 
announced  the  presence  of  a  new  confederation,  wherein  the  Four  Nations 
on the Susquehanna would henceforth speak with one voice, principally his. 
Logan  then  scolded,  “You  People  of  Conestogoe”  brought  the  Shawnee  to 
Philadelphia  “about  twenty  years  ago  .  .  .  and  promised  the  Governor  that

they would answer for the Shawnees that they should live peaceably.” Civility 
ignored  this  attempt  to  divide  and  only  asked  Logan  to  intercede  on  their 
behalf  collectively  with  the  governor  of  Virginia. Together  they  planned  to 
send  a  belt  of  wampum  to Williamsburg. Then  Civility  pulled  Logan  aside 
privately to express his concern that “some of the five Nations, especially the 
Cayugas, had . . . expressed a Dissatisfaction at the large Settlements made by 
the English on the Susquehanna, and that they seemed to claim a Property 
or  Right  to  those  Lands.”  He  then  urged  the  secretary  to  use  the  power  of 
his government to “better prevent all misunderstanding.” The Iroquois claim 
helps  to  explain  the  confederation  of  the  Susquehanna  Indians,  but  so  too 
does  the  need  to  present  a  united  front  to  the  Pennsylvanians  to  use  them 
diplomatically  to  challenge  the  Cayuga  claimants,  forestall  retribution  from 
the Virginia government, and seek relief from encroaching Pennsylvania and 
Maryland  settlers.  Combined  with  threats  of  removal  to  the  west  and  into 
the French orbit, confederating into a single voice represented a skillful dip-
lomatic Four Nations’ response to pressures against their homeland and their 
independence.19

On July 19 Civility and other Susquehanna chiefs arrived at Philadelphia to 
meet with Governor Keith. Not surprisingly, the Eurocentric Keith asserted 
that the French were behind the Cayuga claim and the Susquehanna Indians’ 
warfare to the south, rather than understand both actions as Indian diplo-
macy  of  self-preservation.  However,  Keith  did  not  speak  down  to  Civility, 
but  used  the  metaphor  of  friendship  and  Civility’s  own  words  in  response 
to  Logan  the  year  before.  Keith  relied  on  the  “League  of  Friendship”  and 
the metaphor of friendship to achieve his diplomatic goals, echoing Civility 
when he said, “We are one People and not to be separated in interest” by the 
Five Nations or anyone else. He then forbade them from abetting the Five 
Nations when they traveled through the Susquehanna towns. Civility spoke 
through interpreter John Cartlidge and voiced his fear that if they did so “it 
will doubtless occasion the Death of us, . . . the Senecas . . . will be enraged 
against  us  when  they  know  that  we  are  willing  to  be  at  Peace  with  those 
Nations that they resolve to maintain War against.” Keith then committed to 
meet with the governors of Virginia and Maryland and to hold a council with 
the Iroquois at Philadelphia the next year. Keith and Civility further agreed 
to send belts of wampum to the governments and the Indians of Virginia and 
Maryland to curb future incursions from the south.20

In  early  spring  1721,  Governor  Keith  set  out  for  Williamsburg  to  make 
plans for the treaties Pennsylvania and Virginia intended to make with the

Five Nations in the summer. On the way, he met with Samuel Robins return-
ing  from  the  south  with  wampum  belts  from  “the  Indians  of  Virginia”  as 
assurance that they “will not for the future pass over Potomac River to the 
Eastward  or  Northward,  or  the  high  Ridge  of  Mountains  extending  along 
the  back  of  Virginia,”  provided  that  the  Susquehanna  Indians  adhered  to 
that border as well. In the summer Keith, Spotswood, and the Five Nations 
would use this boundary settlement fastened by wampum belts between the 
Susquehanna and Virginia Indians to broker a peace along the English back-
country and the Five Nations’ frontier.21

At the end of June, Governor Keith received word that representatives of 
the Five Nations led by Ghesaont, a Seneca, had arrived in Pennsylvania, and 
despite  being  “invited  to  Philadelphia,  had  positively  refused  to  come  any 
nearer  than  Conestogoe.”  Ghesaont  intended  to  negotiate  from  a  position 
of power on turf over which the Five Nations claimed authority. Governor 
Keith relented and with several of his council departed from Philadelphia on 
July 3 and arrived at Civility’s cabin in Conestogoe on the fifth, for the first 
of  five  days  of  speeches,  gifts,  and  negotiations  between  the  three  powers. 
Keith opened the council by addressing the hosts, the Susquehanna Indians, 
in a new way. He called the Susquehanna Indians, “Brothers and Children,” 
as he led into a discussion of boundaries, announcing that he and the gov-
ernor of Virginia approved of the border proposed by the Virginia Indians, 
and advised the Susquehanna Indians to observe it. He turned briefly to the 
metaphor of friendship, but then he took on the role of the wiser, protective, 
paternalistic father, guiding them toward peace over war, worrying, “I cannot 
suffer you to be hurt no more than I would my own children.” Just a year 
before Civility had praised William Penn to Keith, reminding the governor 
that the proprietor would “not call them Brothers, because Brothers might 
differ, nor Children because these might offend and require Correction, but 
he would reckon them as one Body, one Blood, one Heart, and one Head.” 
Now, speaking in front of the Iroquois, Keith shifted from the metaphor of 
friendship  and  equality  to  that  of  family  and  paternalistic  hierarchy. Then 
he turned to the Iroquois and Gheasont and addressed them as “Friends and 
Brothers,” and used the egalitarian metaphor of friendship to persuade them 
to adhere to the peace.

Ghesaont would not have the terms of debate dictated to him, however, and 
his speech addressed the “rust” that Pennsylvania had allowed to tarnish the 
“Chain of Friendship.” The liquid that oxidized the chain was rum. Ghesaont 
opened his speech with a story that made the case. “Traders carrying Goods

and  Liquors  up  the  Susquehanna  river  sometimes  meet  with  [our]  young 
People going out to war, and treat them unkindly . . . and call them Dogs . . .  
the young men answered, that if they were Dogs then they might act as such; 
Whereupon, they seized a Keg of Liquor and ran away with it.” If his people 
were guilty of abusing white traders and settlers in Pennsylvania, the cause was 
rum. If they had to go to war against southern Indians, it was due to the insuf-
ficient supply of necessary trade goods offered at Albany and the oversupply 
of rum through Pennsylvania. In short, Ghesaont argued that rum headed up 
the Susquehanna was responsible for Iroquois warriors headed down.22

In the end, the Five Nations agreed to the boundary in exchange for the 
Pennsylvania  promise  to  try  to  better  control  the  liquor  trade  and  offers 
of  fair  dealing  at  Philadelphia  should  the  Iroquois  wish  to  travel  that  far. 
In  the  face  of  the  militarily  superior  Senecas  and  the  Cayuga  claimants  to 
their land, Civility and the Susquehanna Indians remained silent while Keith 
and the Five Nations came to an understanding. With that, Ghesaont headed 
south  to  Williamsburg  to  similarly  exchange  the  boundary  agreement  and 
promise of peace for the opportunity to trade that might force New York and 
Pennsylvania agents to offer even better terms. Through a series of individual 
treaties in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the English believed they 
had  finally  brokered  a  frontier  peace,  while  the  Iroquois  leveraged  better 
prices  for  needed  goods  by  dividing  their  English  suppliers  and  custom-
ers. Native and European empires had caught the Susquehanna Indians in 
the middle, cutting them off from hunting grounds west of the mountains 
and  south  of  the  Potomac  River,  just  as  game  was  becoming  scarce. This 
coalesced at a time when Anglo-French relations began to sour once more, 
and  as  Maryland  traders,  settlers,  and  government  officials  pressed  their 
claims to lands that stretched to the 40th parallel, north of Philadelphia and 
Conestogoe.23

the murder of sawantaeny, continued . . .

From the perspective of Philadelphia, the fragile peace of 1721 rested on the 
thin ice of the lower Susquehanna River Valley as the winter of 1722 com-
menced. The killing of Sawantaeny, a Seneca hunter on Susquehanna land 
along the Monocacy Path to the Potomac, by traders hauling rum seemed a 
threat to plunge the backcountry into war if Pennsylvania did not act swiftly. 
And so, Governor Keith rushed Logan—the killer’s employer—and French

to Conestogoe to administer justice and begin the Indian ritual of “covering 
the dead” and “wiping away tears.” The Susquehanna Indians certainly were 
not crying over the death of Sawantaeny, an Iroquois interloper in their eyes, 
and neither were the Five Nations, who knew by the location of the mur-
der that Sawantaeny was likely hunting across the Potomac. And Governor 
Keith knew it when he sent Logan and French to Conestogoe with instruc-
tions to obtain a Susquehanna messenger to travel to Onondaga to call the 
Five Nations to Philadelphia to receive presents and witness justice to atone 
for  the  death  of  their  brother  Sawantaeny.  Keith  saw  an  opportunity  not 
only to clean the Covenant Chain with the Five Nations to ensure the 1721 
peace, but to invest authority in the Iroquois over the Susquehanna Valley in 
exchange for his own plans of land development as well as the colony’s. The 
Five  Nations  recognized  an  opportunity  as  well  to  use  their  Susquehanna 
suzerainty to leverage their own bargain.24

When  the  Cartlidges  learned  that  the  news  of  Sawantaeny’s  death  had 
reached Philadelphia, they called upon Civility to convene a council to inves-
tigate and “bury” the matter. Civility saw in this an opportunity to blame the 
Seneca Indian’s death upon himself and to accept apologies and condolences 
from the English on behalf of the Five Nations and thus diplomatically cut 
them out of the matter. He did precisely this on March 6 and proclaimed 
that “if the Xtians were Sattisfied the Indians were Soe too” and there should 
be  “noe  more  noise  About  it.”  Governor  Keith  had  other  ideas  about  the 
“noise.” The Cartlidge brothers murdered Sawantaeny on the Four Nations’ 
land. That land guaranteed them their independence and formed the basis of 
their multinational confederation to retain sovereignty over it in the face of 
the Five Nations’ claims, encroaching settlers, and dishonest traders. Penn’s 
treaties of 1682 and 1701 invested them with written authority over the land. 
Civility’s strategy made sense.25

Logan and French set out from Philadelphia on March 7. They reached 
John  Cartlidge’s  cabin  near  Conestogoe  and  arrested  him  two  days  later 
and collected his brother twenty-four hours after that. Since John Cartlidge 
was  the  regular  interpreter  employed  by  the  colony  at  Conestogoe,  Logan 
sent for Peter Bazaillon who lived thirty-six miles upriver. Bazaillon arrived 
on  March  13  and  the  conference  proceeded  the  following  morning.  Logan 
began  by  expressing  their  sorrow  to  Civility  and  to  Savannah,  the  chief  of 
the Shawnees and cousin to Weenepeweeweytah—Sawantaeny’s widow—for 
the  loss  of  Sawantaeny,  the  first  frontier  murder  in  Pennsylvania  “for  near 
Forty years past.” Over the next eight hours they examined eight witnesses

including  six  Indians,  and  the  Cartlidges’  two  white  indentured  servants. 
They did not view Sawantaeny’s body, which was dead for six weeks and bur-
ied perhaps three days’ travel hence beneath the cabin floor on the spot where 
he died. At the end of the day, Logan showed the Susquehanna Indians some 
condolence gifts for the Senecas—two stroud coats and a belt of wampum—
and they chose Satcheetchoo, a Cayuga, and Civility to carry the goods and 
to deliver a message to the Seneca. While Civility declared matter closed, he 
agreed to the delivery, perhaps because in this way the Susquehanna Indians 
could prove their strength and independence by acting as the powerbrokers 
of peace.26

Earlier in the day Logan had learned that the Iroquois had sent down a 
“large Belt of Wampum, with the figure of a Rundlet [a small rum keg] and 
a Hatchet on it” to the Indians settled upward on the Susquehanna, signaling 
to them that they were to stave any barrels of liquor heading upriver. Logan 
worded his message carefully:

William Penn made a firm Peace and League with the Indians in these 
parts near forty years ago, which League has often been renewed and 
never broken, but an unhappy Accident has lately befallen us. One of 
our Brethren and your People has lost his Life by some of our People; 
rum was the first cause of it; He was warm and brought his Gun in 
Anger against them. They were afraid of his Gun took it from him, 
wounded him and he died. . . . We are now taking the offenders to 
Philadelphia To answer for their Fault. We send these Strouds to cover 
our  Dead  Brother,  and  this  Belt  to  wipe  away Tears;  And  when  we 
know your mind, you shall have all further reasonable satisfaction for 
your Loss.

He  closed  by  inviting  them  to  Philadelphia  to  receive  further  restitution. 
Logan offered no gifts to the Susquehanna Indians, on whose land the killing 
took place, an ominous intentional omission that Civility well understood.27
The following day, Satcheetchoo and Civility left for Seneca country, and 
Logan and French  took John and Edmund  Cartlidge back to Philadelphia 
to  charge  them  with  murder.  Logan  recounted  that  John’s  “Wife  grieved 
almost to Distraction, and would force herself and her child with him, but 
was  at  length  prevailed  with  to  stay.  .  .  . The  woman’s  sorrows  being  loud 
the Indians went in to comfort her, and so we departed.” The Susquehanna 
Indians  were  more  sympathetic  to  the  tears  of  the  wife  of  their  friend,

neighbor,  supplier,  and  interpreter  John  Cartlidge  than  to  Sawantaeny’s 
widow, even though she was the cousin of one of their chiefs. She was, after 
all, the widow of a Seneca.28

Six weeks later, Satcheetchoo and Civility arrived in Philadelphia with a 
response  from  the  Senecas  and  a  return  belt  of  wampum.  Governor  Keith 
welcomed Civility by saying that he and “his Council are here to receive the 
Words of their great friends and Allies the five Nations, And we are glad that 
our dear Brother Capt. Civility is also here to give us a faithful Interpretation, 
that We may clearly see into the Hearts and Breasts of our good Friends (the 
Iroquois).”  Keith  had  made  the  Iroquois  his  friends,  and  Civility  (and  the 
Four Nations) his brother.29

Civility reported the Iroquois had received the gifts “but do not receive 
them  as  any  Satisfaction  for  the  Loss  of  their  Brother.”  They  were  will-
ing  to  accept  satisfaction  “but  would  not  come  to  [Philadelphia]  on  this 
occasion  .  .  .  for  as  the  offense  was  committed  by  the  English,  it  is  the 
Governor’s Duty to go up to them . . . immediately, even this day without 
the Loss of any time.” Keith then charged Satcheetchoo to carry an answer 
back to the Senecas in which he stated his intention of traveling with the 
governor of Virginia to Albany to meet with the governor of New York in 
the  summer  and  would  meet  with  the  Five  Nations  then  and  there—in 
Albany, not Onondaga. He also assured them that “We . . . shall continue 
to  pursue  the  same  measures  with  the  offenders  as  if  an  Englishman  had 
lost  his  Life,”  and  he  described  the  conditions  for  murder  and  justifiable 
homicide by self-defense. At this Civility and his Susquehanna attendants 
recoiled  and  pleaded  for  their  release.  Keith  then  answered  by  addressing 
the Four  Nations Indians  as “Friends  and Brothers of Conestogoe.” With 
the Iroquois out of earshot, and needing Four Nations’ compliance, Keith 
abandoned  the  “Brothers  and  Children”  appellation  and  promoted  them 
back to “Friends” first and “Brothers” second. He did so twice in his speech 
to explain that he had no choice but to prosecute the Cartlidges, that the 
law  bound  him  to  do  so.  In  March  the  Cartlidges  had  appeared  before  a 
Philadelphia judge and made bail, though John’s name was “struck from the 
Commission of the Peace for the County of Chester.” On May 4, the day 
that Satcheetchoo and Civility arrived in Philadelphia, the council ordered 
the  Sheriff  to  incarcerate  the  Cartlidges  and  “prosecuted  according  to  the 
Law.” They petitioned for a trial on July 2, but the government tabled the 
petition  pending treaty  negotiations  between Pennsylvania, Virginia, New 
York, and the Five Nations set for August in Albany.30

Also on July 2, a letter arrived in Philadelphia to the provincial council 
from  Governor  Keith,  who  was  at  Conestogoe. The  Susquehanna  Indians 
had  summoned  him  there  to  complain  of  Maryland  surveyors  running 
lines in preparations for settlers on land directly southwest of the river and 
their towns, the land on which Sawantaeny had died. Keith proposed run-
ning lines himself and marking the land as a proprietary manor named for 
Springet Penn, and he directed “a Company of Militia from New Castle to 
march” to the region to counter the “proceedings of Mary Land.” “I cannot 
think of any other effectual method for preserving the Peace,” Keith warned, 
and he reported the happiness with which the Susquehanna Indians regarded 
these measures to forestall white settlement west of the river. For Keith the 
Albany Treaty  Council,  and  thus  the  killing  of  Sawantaeny,  was  taking  on 
a  new  meaning  and  significance.  A  reaffirmation  of  the  1684  Iroquois  ces-
sion  of  claims  to  the  Susquehanna  River Valley  would  further  substantiate 
Pennsylvania’s  claim  of  land  to  the  point  where  that  river  emptied  into 
the  Chesapeake  Bay  at  the  39th  parallel,  far  below  Maryland’s  claim.  Back 
in  Philadelphia  the  Cartlidges  sat  in  jail,  as  much  diplomatic  prisoners  as 
defendants  awaiting  trial.  At  the  end  of  July  Satcheetchoo  and  Civility 
returned again from Iroquois country, announcing that the Senecas would be 
pleased to meet them at Albany in August, but that they desire that Edmund 
and John Cartlidge “may not be put to death for it . . . one life is enough to 
be lost, there should not two die. . . . John Cartlidge had been a long time 
Bound, and they desire he may be bound no longer.”31

the destruction of william penn’s chain of friendship, 1722

On August 13, 1722, Governor Keith, four of his council, and other attendants 
from Philadelphia arrived in New York. They delivered to Governor Burnet 
a  letter  stating  their  intentions  to  accompany  him  to  Albany  to  renew  the 
Covenant  Chain  with  the  Five  Nations  after  “the  unhappy  accident  of  an 
Indian  being  lately  killed  in  the  Woods  by  some  of  our  Traders.”  They 
meant  to  prevent  the  Iroquois  League  “from  going  to  War  and  making  a 
Path through our Settlements upon the River Susquehanna.” Burnet agreed 
that  the  Five  Nations’  hostilities  with  Southern  Indians  must  be  stopped, 
especially as they transgressed through Pennsylvania where “the Conestogoe 
Indians were formerly a part of the five Nations called Mingoes, and speak 
the same Language to this Day; That they actually pay Tribute now to the

five Nations, and either from natural affection or Fear are ever under their 
Influence and Power.” This was a classic overstatement of Iroquois authority 
under  the  Covenant  Chain  of  tributary  relationships  binding  lesser  Indian 
nations  to  the  Iroquois  League  and  then  to  the  English  colonies,  and  that 
suited Governor Keith well.32

At  Albany  on  September  7,  Keith  brightened  the  Covenant  Chain 
with  £100  worth  of  presents.  He  pledged  to  prosecute  the  accused  by  the 
standards  of  English  law  in  exchange  for  the  Iroquois  promise  of  peace 
with their Indian and Christian neighbors to the south, and to abide by the 
boundaries  of  the  Potomac  and  “the  high  Ridge  of  Mountains.” The  Five 
Nations affirmed that peace and the boundary, and they forgave the killing 
of Sawantaeny, asking that “the men who did it may be released from Prison 
and set at Liberty, to go whither they please, and we shall Esteem that as a 
mark  of  Regard  and  friendship  for  the  five  Nations,  and  as  a  farther  con-
firmation of this Treaty.” Keith then assented to this request, contradicting 
his  denial  to  Civility  and  the  Four  Nations  in  which  he  claimed  that  the 
king’s law forbade him to do. Sawantaeny’s killers would go free on Iroquois 
authority, not the Susquehanna Indians’, when he returned to Philadelphia, 
law or no law.33

Then,  the  Five  Nations  made  another  overture  after  further  discussion 
with  Keith  not  recorded  in  the  Council  Minutes. The  unrecorded  sidebar 
was  purposeful.  Back  on  the  record,  the  collusion  became  clear,  as  the 
Iroquois then offered, “We here now freely surrender to you all those Lands 
about Conestogoe which the five Nations have claimed, and it is our desire 
that the same may be settled with Christians.” They gave this in exchange 
for  Pennsylvania’s  welcoming  of  Five  Nations’  traders  at  Philadelphia. 
No  one  from  the  Four  Nations  was  there  to  object.  Historians  have  long 
marked  Pennsylvania’s  1736  Treaty  with  the  Iroquois  and  the  resulting 
Walking Purchase of 1737 as the beginning of Proprietary and Iroquois use 
of the “Covenant Chain” to dispossess “Pennsylvania Indians.” The Treaty of 
Albany, fourteen years earlier, set the stage for the ethnic cleansing of Penn’s 
colony. This provision, which Keith happily accepted, marked the beginning 
of the end for Conestoga, Delaware, Shawnee, and Conoy settlements along 
the Susquehanna, as later Pennsylvania governors and Iroquois League chiefs 
would  combine  to  clear  the  valley  of  Indians  over  the  decades  to  come.  It 
also gave Keith another legal document to use in the Penn family’s boundary 
dispute  with  the  colony  of  Maryland,  whose  governor  was  conveniently 
uninvited  to  the  proceedings  at  Albany.  Keith  discarded  Penn’s  “Chain  of

Friendship” with the Susquehanna Indians in favor of the Covenant Chain 
with the Iroquois.34

While the 1722 Treaty of Albany initiated the slow death of Indian settle-
ment on the Susquehanna, it also represented the maturation of the confed-
erate identity of the Four Nations, born at the Conestogoe Treaty of 1720. 
Back in Philadelphia in October 1722, Governor Spotswood asked Keith for 
permission  to  travel  to  Conestogoe  to  treat  directly  with  the  Susquehanna 
Indians, to secure their agreement to the Potomac boundary, and to inform 
them of the Five Nations treaty with Virginia to return all runaway slaves to 
the province. Spotswood had word that the Shawnees on the Susquehanna 
were  harboring  more  than  twenty  runaway  African  slaves  from  Virginia. 
Governor  Keith  approved  of  Spotswood’s  intended  message,  and  of  the 
Virginia  ploy  of  turning  Susquehanna  Indians  into  slave  catchers  not  just 
for  Virginia  runaways  but  those  from  Pennsylvania  as  well.  The  Quaker-
dominated  Pennsylvania  Assembly,  however,  denied  Spotswood’s  request, 
but  Keith  promised  to  carry  those  messages  for  him  to  Conestogoe.  Keith 
had just bought the subjection of the Susquehanna Indians at Albany, and 
he would not forfeit the right so easily, not only to Spotswood’s chagrin, but 
also to the outrage of the Susquehanna Indians.35

On  October  11  Keith  sent  Spotswood’s  message  to  the  Indians  at 
Conestogoe,  along  with  a  copy  of  the  Albany Treaty  for  an  interpreter  to 
read, sparking outrage there. The treaty prescribed penalties for trespass of 
the boundaries. If the Southern Indians would trespass, the Northern Indians 
“may  put  them  to  Death,”  but  if  the  Northern  Indians  would  cross  the 
boundary “either the Southern Indians may put them to Death,” or Virginia 
could sell them into Caribbean slavery. Civility made the response sent back 
to the governor. We have “dread upon us,” he began, because of the prospect 
of enslavement or death for following game, and because “we being here had 
not the opportunity to know what was acted” at Albany. “We were in hopes 
there should have been free Liberty to Pass & Repass,” Civility continued, 
and  concluded by saying that “in the Spring  our Chiefs will pay a visit to 
your Excellency . . . at Philadelphia” where they would make their own treaty 
with Keith and Pennsylvania. Then the Shawnee chief Savannah answered to 
the issue of the runaway slaves and promised that “as soon in the Spring as 
the Bark will run, We will lose no time . . . taking them . . . for they are now 
abroad a Hunting.”36

When  spring  came  there  was  no  word  from  the  Shawnee  about  the 
Virginia slaves. Instead, James Mitchell, the new Commissioner for the Peace

of Chester County reported in April that Ocowellos, the “King of the Upper 
Shawnees,”  had  been  making  visits  to  the  French,  and  he  and  his  people 
were preparing for another visit “shortly intended to the Governor of Canada 
whom they think fit to call their Father.” Alarmed, Keith and the provincial 
council instructed Mitchell to warn the Shawnees that “William Penn’s peo-
ple in this Country, are by Treaties united to all the Indians as in one Body” 
and must not engage the French. Confronted with the threat of defection to 
the French, Pennsylvania officials returned to the egalitarian language of “one 
Body” from Penn’s “Chain” or “League of Friendship.” “If these Indians are 
united to us,” the council continued, but shifted metaphors, “we shall desire 
their Company and that they may live with us as Brethren in Peace & Love 
as all our other Brethren have hitherto done and ever must do with us.” And 
they  gave  Mitchell  “five  gallons  of  rum  to  cheer  their  hearts”  and  a  single 
match  coat  to  confirm  their  words.  Gifts,  however,  could  no  longer  cheer 
Susquehanna Indians’ hearts.37

On May 18 a delegation of Conestogas, Delawares, Shawnees, and Conoys 
from the lower towns arrived at Philadelphia, as promised in the fall. This 
time Whiwhinjac,  a  Conoy  chief,  addressed  the  governor.  Civility  suffered 
a  demotion  to  the  role  of  interpreting  Conoy  to  Delaware  as  the  Conoy 
chief assumed the voice of all the Susquehanna Indians. It had become clear 
that Civility, along with the Delawares and Conestogas, had failed and that 
Pennsylvania had dropped the Chain of Friendship. It was significant that a 
chief of a refugee nation, taken in by the Conestogas and Lenape, now rose to 
speak for the whole confederation. These nations were a collection of equals 
who looked to place the strongest voice at their head.

Thus, there was a new and more muscular tone in Whiwhinjac’s answer 
to the Albany Treaty. Whiwhinjac kept to Civility’s diplomatic strategy of 
asserting the Susquehanna Indians’ sovereignty over the land to negate the 
Albany Treaty,  but  he  spoke  more  forcefully  and  frankly  “in  the  name  of 
all the four Nations of Indians upon the Susquehanna.” First, he reminded 
the governor and council that they and William Penn had agreed that the 
colonists  and  Indians  would  not  be  brothers  and  sisters,  or  parents  and 
offspring, but would be “as one Flesh & one Blood under one Head,” as 
Civility had reminded them almost five years earlier. They were equals, the 
Indians and Pennsylvanians, Whiwhinjac contended, and he used the kill-
ing of Sawantaeny to drive home that point. He recognized that the Treaty 
of  Albany  was  more  than  just  a  peace  with  the  Five  Nations  but  served 
to  “bury  the  Blood  of  an  Indian  that  had  been  spilt  by  the  English”  on

Susquehanna Indians’ land. On behalf of the Four Nations of Indians upon 
the  Susquehanna,  Whiwhinjac  then  expressed  the  “desire  that  the  same 
Blood may not only be buried but wash’d away as it were by a swift running 
Stream of Water . . . and . . . desire the Governor to believe that as they are 
one flesh with the English, they look upon themselves to be equally con-
cerned with them in accidents of that Nature.” Keith should have strength-
ened and brightened the chain with them, as well as the Senecas, since each 
had made separate and equal covenants. “And,” he continued, “if it should 
happen  at  any  time  that  either  of  them  did  forget  the  strict  League  of 
Friendship made between them, the Party who faithfully kept and remem-
bered the Covenant should take the other, who had forgot, gently as it were 
by the shoulder and put him in mind of it again.” Whiwhinjac’s assertion 
was that the Chain of Friendship crafted with Penn in 1701 stretched from 
Conestogoe Town to Philadelphia across Four Nations’ land and was in no 
way attached to Onondaga, and he was about to use his role as an equal to 
remind Keith and Pennsylvanians of this fact.38

Foremost, Keith and the provincial government had “forgotten” the chain 
with Conestogoe when they negotiated the Albany Treaty by investing the 
Five  Nations  with  authority  over  the  Four  Nations,  but  there  were  other 
complaints.  Whiwhinjac  referred  to  the  Pennsylvania  “Settlers  &  young 
men near Conestogoe & their other Towns” and asked Keith that they “may 
be  directed  to  treat  [the  Four  Nations]  with  Kindness  and  Respect.” The 
young men of Conoy Town complained of the settlers’ cattle and pigs which 
roamed  freely  and  destroyed  Indian  crops.  Whiwhinjac  wanted  “that  the 
English may not be suffered to straighten or pinch the Conoys or Shawnees 
to make them remove further off . . . for they have heard some words to this 
purpose.” Here he combined the complaints about obnoxious settlers, whom 
the Pennsylvania government had repeatedly promised to restrain, with the 
Albany Treaty cession of the “Lands about Conestogoe” by the Five Nations 
to be “settled” by Pennsylvania “with Christians.” He threatened removal of 
Shawnee  and Conoy  trade  to the French  orbit while professing Conestoga 
and Lenape rights to remain in the Susquehanna Valley homeland: effectively 
extending their national boundary to the west while maintaining the Four 
Nations confederation. Finally, he clarified the Four Nations’ independence 
from  the  Iroquois  and  equality  with  Pennsylvania  in  a  closing  sentence. 
“The  Shawnees,  Conoys,  Conestogoes  &  Delawares,  shall  never  forget  the 
words  of  William  Penn,  but  since  that Treaty  was  made  between  Him  & 
Them,  [the Four Nations] do not find that  [Pennsylvanians] have been so

careful to come as often to renew it . . . at Conestogoe, as [we] have been to 
come to . . . Philadelphia.” He presented 200 deerskins to bind his words, an 
unusually large number to display the earnestness of their convictions, their 
independence from the Five Nations, and that they were “one flesh” with the 
Pennsylvanians, their equals.39

After  a  recess,  Governor  Keith  made  his  response  in  the  afternoon,  and 
began  with  one  carefully  selected  word  that  set  the  tone  for  Pennsylvania–
Susquehanna  Indian  relations  for  the  next  three  decades:  “Brethren.”  Keith 
would  have  none  of  Whiwhinjac’s  egalitarian  “one  flesh”  metaphor,  and 
instead  chose  the  paternalistic  “brotherhood”  in  which  a  pecking  order  of 
power  relations  exists.  William  Penn  “is  gone,”  began  Keith,  and  it  is  “the 
Orders & Command of the Great King George my Master, That the English 
&  Indians  should  live  together  as  Brethren  in  one  Family.”  He  continued 
and scolded that “old and wise men” must “overcome & convince the weaker 
heads of the young & foolish.” Keith was not merely urging Indian chiefs to 
control their younger warriors but also making the case that there was a power 
relationship between the English, the wiser, older brothers, and the Indians, 
the younger and more foolish. He acknowledged that by the “Chain of Love 
and Friendship” between Penn and their ancestors that “Philadelphia is joined 
to Conestogoe,” but chastised that they should “be exceedingly careful to keep 
that End of the Chain towards your own Settlements always bright and clear.”
Keith  proceeded  to  dismiss  Whiwhinjac’s  complaints  about  the  settlers’ 
animals by reproaching the Conoy “young people” who “with their Dogs & 
Arrows . . . Hunt & Kill [the settlers’] Creatures.” He then promised to “take 
care that no English Settlements shall hereafter be made too near your Towns 
to disturb you, so that the Shawnees & Conoys may remain in Peace where 
they are now, for we . . . do not desire to see them remove further from us.” 
In  this  speech,  the  egalitarian  metaphor  of  friendship  did  not  exist;  in  its 
place now was a firmly patriarchal, familial metaphor geared toward power 
diplomacy. The governor bound his words with twelve gallons of rum, 300 
pounds of flour, pipes, tobacco, fifteen match coats, fifteen blankets, shoes, 
buckles, stockings, a barrel of powder and 150 pounds of lead. He intended 
the significant amount and variety of goods to bind the still-important Four 
Nations to the Pennsylvania frontier, to serve as a symbol to the Susquehanna 
Indians of his colony’s power to supply them with the necessaries of life, and 
to signal to them their dependence on and subjection to Pennsylvania and 
English authority as opposed to any other colony or the French. They were 
not “one flesh.”40

But before the Treaty Council concluded, Civility broke from his role as 
interpreter and interrupted that they “looked upon it as a great Hardship for 
them to be confined from Hunting on the other side [of the] Potomac, for 
that in their neighboring Woods was but little Game.” Their ability to trade 
for their necessities now rested on the supply of whitetail deer that they had 
hunted for forty years in the Susquehanna Valley and now needed to follow 
west of the “high Ridge of Mountains” and south of the Potomac. They had 
no choice. Keith coldly reminded him that “the five Nations by their Treaty 
with  the  Governor  of Virginia  [the  Albany  Purchase]  had  agreed  not  only 
to  forbear  themselves,  but  also  to  restrain  the  Susquehanna  Indians  from 
Hunting there.” Civility retorted that he, Whiwhinjac, and the rest would 
then proceed to Annapolis to seek a better deal with the Maryland govern-
ment,  which  was  pressing  its  claims  to  southern  Pennsylvania.  Keith  lied 
that “the people of Maryland & Pennsylvania were very good Friends,” and 
sternly reminded Civility that the Susquehanna Indians “were Inhabitants of 
Pennsylvania,  they  were  immediately  subjects  of  that  Government.”  With 
that,  the  Four  Nations  of  Indians  upon  Susquehanna  gradually  departed 
westward after 1723, establishing a new homeland in the valleys that drained 
into the Allegheny River. They became “Allegheny Indians,” demonstrating 
that they were subject only unto themselves.41

Between  1724  and  1728  many  Delawares,  Shawnees,  Conestogas,  and 
Conoys  began  leaving  their  Susquehanna  towns  ahead  of  white  settlement 
to  form  new  towns  on  the  Juniata,  Conemaugh,  Stonycreek,  Loyalhanna, 
Allegheny, Monongahela, Youghiogheny, Beaver, and Ohio rivers. The splin-
tered  Seneca,  likely  with  descendants  of  Erie  and  Monongahela  captives, 
joined the Conestogas as “Mingos” and formed eleven principal towns with the 
Lenape, Shawnee, Conoy, and Conestoga: Kishocoquilla’s Town, Conemaugh, 
Quemahoning, Keckenpaulin’s Town, Kittanning, Chartier’s Town, Sewickley 
Town,  Logstown,  Sacunk,  Kuskusky,  and  Shenango.  Here  they  would  recre-
ate  a  multinational  political  identity,  still  seeking  their  independence  from 
Iroquois,  provincial,  and  European  claims.  In  a  series  of  agreements  in  the 
1730s and 1740s, the Iroquois and Pennsylvania provincial government agreed 
that  the  Covenant  Chain  placed  the  title  to  Pennsylvania  lands  from  the 
Susquehanna to the Ohio and beyond in Iroquois hands, with rights to sell to 
the Pennsylvanians.42

In response, the Susquehanna transplants to the Allegheny and Ohio val-
leys transferred their allegiance to France during Braddock’s campaign at the 
outset of the French and Indian War. They made war on Pennsylvania and its

settlers from the Susquehanna to the Delaware Valleys for three years. In 1755, 
when they opened their first War of Independence against Pennsylvania, they 
announced  to  their  first  colonial  victims  where  Penn’s  Creek  emptied  into 
the  Susquehanna,  “We  are  Allegheny  Indians,  your  enemies.  You  all  must 
die.” When the Delaware chief, and remaining North Branch Susquehanna 
Valley resident, Teedyuscung brokered the 1758 Treaty of Easton ending the 
war between the Pennsylvanians and the Indians from the Delaware to the 
Miami River, former “Four Nations” peoples again declared their independ-
ence in 1759. Tingooqua, “the Catfish,” arrived in Philadelphia that year from 
Kuskusky, the “Allegheny Indians’” principal town on the Beaver River. He 
brought  four  strings  of  wampum  to  seal Teedyuscung’s  treaty  on  behalf  of 
the Delawares, Shawnees, Mingos, and Conoys living in the eleven towns. 
He  said,  “Brother,”  adopting  the  metaphor  of  Penn’s  descendants  but  not 
accepting their superiority,

We make eleven Nations on the West of Allegheny who have heard 
what you and Teedyuscung have concluded at the Treaty of Easton, 
and as we all heartily agree to it . . . we have opened a Road to where 
Teedyuscung Lives. . . . We have found it a very good Road, and all 
our Nations will use this Road for the time to come. We say noth-
ing  of  the  Six  Nations.  We  do  not  reckon  them  among  the  Eleven 
Nations.  We  leave  you  to  treat  with  them  yourselves.  We  make  no 
Road for them. This is your own affair. We only tell you we do not 
include them in anything We say. I have done.43

A few years later, in 1763 they again bound together to fight another war 
for  independence  against  Pennsylvanians. They  would  fail  once  more  and 
began moving west again to the Muskingum and Scioto valleys, and beyond. 
Back in the lower Susquehanna Valley, bloodthirsty Scots Irish settlers call-
ing themselves “the Paxton Boys,” whom the Allegheny Indian raids targeted 
in both wars, rode into Conestogoe Town on December 14 and slaughtered 
the six unarmed inhabitants they found there. Two days after Christmas they 
rode into Lancaster to murder the fourteen remaining Conestogas, complet-
ing  a  genocide.  Out  west,  the  “Eleven  Nations”  fractured.  The  Shawnees 
fought  another  war  in  the  next  decade  against  Virginia  and  Pennsylvania 
residents  in  the  Allegheny  country  and  again  lost  ground. The  Delawares 
refused to join them and instead pursued the right to form their own colony 
from  the  British,  just  as  the  American  Revolution  became  a  shooting  war.

After  the  Revolution  they  became  the  “Miami  Confederacy,”  and  again  in 
the early nineteenth century under Tecumseh, descendants of “Four Nations” 
Indians  once  more  attempted  pan-Indianism  as  a  mode  of  land  defense. 
The strategy continued throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 
incurring losses and winning victories. It survives on native lands to this day 
where  multinationals  still  cooperate  to  protect  their  sovereignty  over  their 
adopted homelands.44

burying sawantaeny

Back  on  Monocacy  Creek  in  1722,  Weenepeweeweytah  lay  alone  with  her 
husband’s  corpse  on  the  dirt  floor  of  the  hunting  cabin,  full  of  grief  and 
worry.  She  needed  help  to  bury  him  in  the  frozen  ground,  so  she  set  out 
northeast  on  the  Warrior’s  Path.  While  she  was  away,  Kannannowach, 
a  Cayuga  hunter,  stopped  at  the  cabin  and  found  Sawantaeny,  and  he 
with  two  Conestoga  Indians,  the  wife  of  Passalty  and  another  called  “the 
Hermaphrodite” went “to bury him lest the Beasts or Fowls should eat him.” 
They  estimated  that  Sawantaeny  had  been  dead  for  a  week,  “for  the  Body 
then Stunk.” “They found three wounds in his Head, They washed away the 
Blood and the Brains appeared.” After cleaning his body, they wrapped him 
in his bearskin and buried him in the floor of the cabin where the soil had 
not frozen. Weenepeweeweytah arrived back shortly afterward, still with no 
help and not sure what she would do, only to discover that she would not be 
able to look upon her husband for a last time, and so she wept.45

Although there was a great deal of talk about metaphorical tears and broken 
hearts from the  Pennsylvanians and the Five Nations, Weenepeweeweytah, 
the Shawnee widow from Conestogoe, was the only one who really cried for 
the Seneca Sawantaeny. Pennsylvania and the Five Nations used his death to 
craft  diplomacy  to  serve  their  own  ends  regarding  the  Susquehanna Valley 
ground in which he lay buried. The Susquehanna Indians similarly attempted 
to use the killing of Sawantaeny to solidify their claim to their homeland by 
harkening back to the precedent of treaty making with William Penn, and 
by creating the new confederated national identity of “the Four Nations of 
Indians upon the Susquehanna,” a political identity anchored in place. It was 
not enough. Within the decade most Indians would trade the Susquehanna 
Valley for new towns on the Allegheny where they would sustain their “Four 
Nations” identity for as long as possible, while the Iroquois dealt away their

5.  The Tuscaroras had joined the Confederacy in the previous decade, but the Five 
Nations name still stuck, used by Pennsylvanians, the Five Nations Indians, and 
the Indians on the Susquehanna. This article will use the term “Five Nations” 
or  “the  League”  for  the  Iroquois  Confederacy.  Their  story  is  in  Jennings, 
Ambiguous Iroquois Empire; and Daniel K. Richter, The Ordeal of the Longhouse: 
The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization (Chapel 
Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992); and Richter, Native Americans’ 
Pennsylvania,  Pennsylvania  History  Studies  8  (University  Park:  Pennsylvania 
Historical Association, 2005). On the Iroquois League of Five Nations’ south-
ward diplomacy and warfare from the “Grand Settlement of 1701” to 1723, see 
Daniel  P.  Barr,  Unconquered: The  Iroquois  League  at War  in  Colonial  America 
(Westport,  CT:  Praeger,  2006),  95–113;  Jennings,  Ambiguous  Iroquois  Empire,

Transfiguration:  The  Susquehannock  Indians  in  the  Seventeenth  Century” 
Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 112 (February 15, 1968): 15–53. 
The Lenape called them “Minquas,” meaning Iroquoian speakers in their lan-
guage, and so some Indians and Europeans called them “Mingoes.” The return-
ing Susquehannocks referred to themselves as Conestogoes or Conestogas from 
1717 to 1723. For clarity, this article will refer to the town as Conestogoe and 
the people as Conestogas. On the Lenape see Jean Soderlund, Lenape Country: 
Delaware  Valley  Society  before  William  Penn  (Philadelphia:  University  of 
Pennsylvania Press, 2015). Sometime in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth 
century they began to adopt the name Europeans called them, Delawares, but 
in the 1717–23 era, as today, both Lenape and Delaware are employed by people 
of that nation, so both names are employed here. On Penn and the Indians, 
see Richter, Native Americans’ Pennsylvania, 41–44; Merrell, Into the American 
Woods, 13; Joseph E. Illick, Colonial Pennsylvania: A History (New York: Charles 
Scribner’s Sons, 1976), 22–30; C. A. Weslager, The Delaware Indians: A History

at  Shackamaxon,  or  other  deals,  see  James  O’Neil  Spady,  “Colonialism  and 
the Discursive Antecedents of Penn’s Treaty with the Indians,” in Friends and 
Enemies  in  Penn’s Woods,  ed.  Pencak  and  Richter,  18–40.  Jennings’s  quote  is 
from Ambiguous Iroquois Empire, 241. On the filling of Pennsylvania with refu-

raids upon Virginia Indians beginning with the 1712 Tuscarora War, through 
the 1715 Yamasee War and into 1719. He seeks Schuyler’s assistance in restrain-
ing  the  Iroquois  attacks  on  Indians  allied  with  Virginia.  See  also  Richter,

Indians  likely  meant  the  Blue  Ridge  that  begins  as  the  Blue  Mountain  in 
Pennsylvania  north  of  the  Lehigh  River  at  the  Delaware,  and  arcs  south-
westward,  exiting  the  colony  west  of  present-day  Gettysburg.  The  summits 
of  the  Blue  Mountain  in  Pennsylvania  and  Maryland  range  only  between 
1,000–2,000 feet in elevation and contain many low passes. The Susquehanna 
Indians and the Pennsylvania and Virginia governments interpreted the “high 
Ridge” as the Allegheny Mountain—the highest and steepest in Pennsylvania 
and  western  Maryland  with  summits  over  3,000  feet  and  higher  still  in 
Virginia. The Allegheny Ridge lies sixty miles west of the Blue Ridge, with the 
Shenandoah River, known then as the South Branch of the Potomac, draining

the great valley in between. Ten nations of Virginia Indians, mostly removed 
from  the  Chesapeake  and  the  piedmont  in  the  seventeenth  century,  lived, 
farmed, and hunted in the Shenandoah Valley, so it is unlikely that they would 
have  set  a  boundary  between  themselves  and  the  Susquehanna  Indians  that 
ceded their own homeland.

24.  White, Middle Ground, 75–82 discusses the condolence ritual of offering com-
pensation in goods as restitution for murder to “cover the dead” of a lost family 
member, and to “dry the tears” of a nation or tribe when the murder crossed 
political boundaries. Merrell, Into the American Woods, 153–56, discusses these 
condolence rituals in Pennsylvania.
