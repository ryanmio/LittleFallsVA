s Rebellion

Indian

Country

James D. Rice

Bacons Rebellion, a bitter civil war that convulsed the key English colony of Virginia
in 1676, has long been considered one of the most significant events in American his-
tory. It is a fixture of high school and university courses, textbooks, and scholarly writ-
ing. Although the rebellion was condemned as treason by colonial-era writers, after the
American Revolution it came to be regarded as an important step in the rise of freedom
and democracy and thus as an integral part of the nations creation story. This line of
interpretation drew a stark contrast between the reactionary forces led by Virginias royal
governor Sir William Berkeley, the "archenemy of colonial democracy," and the frontier
planters led by Nathaniel Bacon, the "patriot, who gave his life in the cause of American
liberty" in a valiant attempt to get out from "under the heel of the mother country." This
portrait of Bacon as a freedom-loving protorevolutionary came under heavy fire after
World War II, however, when Wesley Frank Craven and Wilcomb Washburn demon-
strated that it was incompatible with the evidence and with any reasonable definition of
democracy. Bacon explicitly denied having any democratic ("leveling") tendencies; be-
sides, the Baconites' main grievance was that Governor Berkeley "refused to authorize the
slaughter and dispossession" of Virginias Indian neighbors. Would a truly "democratic
champion of the oppressed," Washburn asked, "limit his benevolence to whites only?"1

Cravens and Washburn's interventions forced a major reconsideration of Bacons Re-
bellion beginning in the 1950s. Since then, two lines of investigation have predominated.
One approach has been to identify the major fault lines within Virginia society prior to
and during the rebellion. Did they lie between different kinds of elite tobacco planters,

as Bernard Bailyn argued? Or did strong county governments create a class of local elites
whose independent power made it possible to defy the governor, as Warren Billings sug-
gested? A second approach has been to work toward more sweeping statements about the
rebellions place in American history. Such writings have gravitated toward analyses of
race, slavery, and the conquest of Native America. Michael Oberg, for instance, treats the
rebellion as part of a long-running conflict between "frontiersmen" seeking the eradica-
tion of Indians and "metropolitans" favoring a more nuanced approach.2

The most influential interpretation of Bacons Rebellion today, Edmund S. Morgans
American Slavery, American Freedom (1975), combines those two approaches. Morgan ar-
gues that the conflict brought out "the grievances ofVirginias impoverished freemen" and
forced Virginians to find a way to resolve their deep-seated differences without another
destructive civil war. The rebellion, an "instinctive attempt to subdue class conflict by rac-
ism," pointed the way toward a new settlement where white Virginians enjoyed greater
liberty precisely because African Americans enjoyed less of it. In the wake of the rebellion
"Virginias ruling class" replaced most white indentured servants with slaves, "proclaimed
that all white men were superior to black," and offered their "social (but white) inferi-
ors" better economic opportunities and more political power. Whiteness also conferred
numerous legal and social advantages, binding whites together in their shared liberties.
For Morgan, then, 1676 was the pivotal moment in a long process during which "slavery
and freedom made their way to Englands first American colony and grew there together,
the one supporting the other" through a combination of systemic oppression and white
populism.3

Yet for all the attention that Bacons Rebellion has garnered over the past two gen-
erations, the modern debate over its origins and significance has yielded little consensus
among historians. Attempts to find the common characteristics that united the rebels or

the loyalists have yielded inconclusive results, and even Morgans thesis has begun to show
some signs of wear (particularly regarding the timing and causes of Virginias transition
to slavery).4

On one key point however, scholars have achieved a consensus: Bacons Rebellion
was set off by a disagreement over how best to handle a conflict between Indians and
colonists in the Potomac Valley. But beyond providing "the spark . . . leading to Ba-
cons Rebellion," what part did Indians play in the conflict? To what extent were Indi-
ans truly actors in the rebellion-
people whose motives and actions shaped the course
of events?5

The implicit answer offered by historians of colonial America is "not much." In most
accounts, Indians, having inadvertently triggered an earthquake along an unstable and
highly dangerous fault line within Virginia society, then stand off to the side while the
colonists fight it out among themselves. Occasionally a group of Indians drops into the
story, serves as a foil for Bacons men, suffers at their hands, and drops out again. What
Native Americans wanted, and how the relationships between different Indian nations
shaped events, are not really part of the story; thus we learn little about any one group
except its name and perhaps its location.6

Historians of Native America, for their part, have never fully brought their expertise to
bear upon Bacons Rebellion. Some writers, it is true, situate the rebellion in the context
of white conquest, but that is not at all the same thing as giving full weight to specific
Indian peoples' choices and actions. The few writers who do adopt a Native American-
centered approach take an Iroquois-centric approach, noting the rebellions significance
for the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy but not for the rest of Native America.

Bacons Rebellion in Indian Country

729

Scholars of the Southeast have generally missed the significance of the rebellion altogeth-
er.7

In short, the burgeoning literature on Native American history and the long-running
conversation about Bacons Rebellion have not yet been adequately joined. What if they
were joined, though? Rather than simply asking whether Indians played a "role" in the
rebellion or had "agency," it is important to think in terms of "problems," or "tensions,"
and of their resolutions. This approach makes possible a more open-ended inquiry: What
issues were at play during the rebellion, and how were they laid to rest? Is it possible that
issues formulated and contested among Indians, as well as among colonists, had some-
thing to do with the causes of the rebellion, with the ways it was fought, and with its
long-term consequences?

Dozens of Indian nations and several colonies were caught up, each in its own distinc-
tive way, in the events surrounding Bacons Rebellion. Although a full accounting of this
complex situation is beyond the scope of this essay, we can at least begin to get a sense
of how a continental perspective might alter our understanding of the rebellion, and of
early America, by looking to the closely intertwined fates of Indian nations in three dif-
ferent regions. First, a focus on the Chesapeake Bay colonies' northern flank, with par-
ticular attention to the Susquehanna Valley and the Potomac Valley groups, does much
to explain the origins of the rebellion. Second, adding an examination of how the rebel-
lion played out among the "neighbor Indians" living within Virginia and Maryland aids
in understanding the conduct of the rebellion (and thus in appreciating what it was truly
about). Third, expanding the framework still further to include the southern Piedmont
and mountains, with particular attention to the nations involved in the Indian slave trade
in the Southeast- while still keeping one eye on the Five Nations and other northern-
ers- reveals much about the consequences and lasting legacies of the rebellion.

Reframed to encompass Indian country, Bacons Rebellion emerges yet again as a criti-
cal event in American history, albeit for different reasons than those previously advanced.
From this perspective the rebellion appears to have been a manifestation of a much broad-
er transformation, even a fundamental restructuring, of patterns of war, exchange, society,
and diplomacy throughout eastern North America. It was rooted in troubles emanating
primarily from within Indian country, and only secondarily from within Virginia. The
- over primacy àmong the numerous Indian nations of the East and, simul-
real struggles
- were not re-
taneously, over whether Indians or colonists would be the dominant power
solved by the deaths of Bacon in 1676 and Berkeley in 1677. On the contrary, the issues
in play during Bacon s Rebellion were not settled until the end of the seventeenth century,

when Baconite Indian policies finally prevailed and European economic expansion into
the continental interior fueled an escalating cycle of wars, slave trading, epidemics, and
migrations. Paradoxically, this cycle caused many Native Americans to disappear com-
pletely from the map while a small number of Indian nations actually derived strength
from these developments.

The story of Bacon s Rebellion, as it has commonly been told, begins in the summer of
1675 with a petty trading dispute between the Potomac Valley merchant-planter Thomas
Mathew and a group of Doeg Indians. This dispute occurred during a rough patch in the
colony's history, when many Virginians were frustrated and looking for someone to blame:
in recent years they had experienced a spike in taxes due to the expense of the Anglo-Dutch
Wars of 1672-1674, while economic conditions, particularly for landless men and small
planters (many of whom were former indentured servants), were in rapid decline.

The conflict between Mathew and the Doegs led to a series of retaliatory killings, cul-
minating in September 1675 with the accidental murder of fourteen Susquehannock
Indians by Virginia militia officers who mistook the Susquehannocks for Doegs. From
there matters escalated into a general war with the Susquehannocks. The following spring,
a difference of opinion among colonists about how best to conduct the Susquehannock
War escalated into a civil war between forces led by the elderly William Berkeley, gover-
nor of Virginia since 1641, and a young rebel, the recently arrived James River planter
Nathaniel Bacon.

Governor Berkeley wanted to maintain existing alliances with "neighbor Indians"
while conducting the Susquehannock War. Bacon and his followers, conversely, blamed
Indians for many of their problems and thought that Berkeleys policies coddled Indians
at the expense of English colonists; they regarded the Susquehannock War as an opportu-
nity to resolve all of their problems with Indians at one stroke. Against Berkeleys express
orders, Bacon attacked a group of neighbor Indians. Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel and
forced him to submit during a provincial assembly in June 1676. Bacon escaped, then
reappeared in Jamestown, Virginias capital, at the head of a volunteer army and forced
Berkeley to give him a military commission to attack Indians. In July the rebels forced
Berkeley to flee to the Eastern Shore, across the Chesapeake Bay from mainland Vir-
ginia. Jamestown repeatedly changed hands in the summer of 1676 and was burned to
the ground by retreating rebel troops in September. Bacon died in October from an un-
specified disease. His followers fought on until mid-January, when the last of them were
captured or simply went home. The story typically ends with the arrival of a regiment of
British regulars, accompanied by three royal commissioners sent to investigate the mat-
ter, which culminated in Governor Berkeleys disgrace and removal to London. Berkeley
died there in July 1677 without ever having the opportunity to tell his side of the story
to King Charles II.8

That, however, is not the story Indians would have told. Consider for example how a
Susquehannock Indian, speaking of the events leading up to Bacons Rebellion, would

have explained its origins. A populous Iroquoian nation based primarily on the Susque-
hanna River in modern-day Pennsylvania, the Susquehannocks figure prominently in
the records of colonial governments and of French Jesuit missionaries living among the
Five Nations Iroquois, the Susquehannocks' neighbors to the north. As even the most
conventional narratives of Bacons Rebellion suggest, the Susquehannocks were very in-
volved in the beginnings of the rebellion. It is therefore useful to ask: Would the social,
racial, or political divisions among Virginians that dominate modern historical scholar-
ship seem so important in a Susquehannock account? Or would a Susquehannock inter-
locutor have emphasized other events and other divisions?

A Susquehannock account of the origins of Bacons Rebellion would start not with the
English but rather with the Piscataways (located on the Potomac River near the Mary-
land settlements) and the Five Nations. The story would also begin in another century,
because by 1675 the Susquehannocks had been intermittently at war with the Five Na-
tions and the Piscataways for at least a century. The origins of this long conflict seem to
lie in the convergence of several historical forces, including, most crucially, the creation
of the Great League of the Iroquois in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the end
of chronic internecine feuding among the Five Nations. With peace established within
the Great League of the Iroquois, Five Nations warriors redirected their efforts outward.
The Susquehannocks, then occupying lands just to the south of the Five Nations, bore

the brunt of many of these attacks. Consequently the Susquehannocks gradually consoli-
dated and shifted their settlements southward, first to the middle and lower reaches of the
Susquehanna River, then to the upper Potomac basin in about 1575, and finally, in about
1610, back to the lower Susquehanna River near modern-day Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
There the Susquehannocks fell afoul of the Piscataways and other northern Chesapeake
groups, with whom they frequently clashed and developed a deep-seated enmity. In short,
the tension between the Susquefhannocks and all but one of the groups that would later
be their opponents during Bacons Rebellion originated closer to 1575 than to 1675.9

Far from imposing their will upon the Susquehannocks and other Indian nations in
the northern Chesapeake, the newly established English colonies of Virginia (founded in
1607) and Maryland (founded in 1634) were forced to choose sides so they could find a
secure place within the Indians' well-established diplomatic configuration. Virginia sided
with the Susquehannocks, and Maryland fell into the Piscataway orbit. The emergence in
the 1620s of a northern Chesapeake Bay fur-trading connection with Virginia secretary of
state William Claiborne was a critically important development for the Susquehannocks.
Claiborne s trading post at Kent Island, in the upper Chesapeake Bay near modern-day
Annapolis, Maryland, thrived as a result of the Susquehannock alliance. When the ter-
ritory granted to the new colony of Maryland turned out to encompass Kent Island, the
Susquehannocks joined Claiborne in resisting its absorption into Maryland. An addi-
tional irritation for Claiborne was that George Calvert (First Lord Baltimore), the head
of the powerful Calvert family and the lord proprietor of Maryland, was a Catholic, as
were many of his colonists. Like many Englishmen, Claiborne associated Catholicism
with tyrannical and arbitrary rule, with weak elective bodies, and with Englands great
rival, France. The Susquehannocks, whose Five Nations enemies conspicuously harbored
French Jesuit missionaries, may also have regarded Maryland s Catholics with suspicion,
since Maryland too had Jesuit missionaries. During the 1630s and 1640s the Susquehan-
nocks repeatedly attacked Maryland colonists, including the Jesuits among them. They
also, of course, attacked their longtime Piscataway enemies and other Potomac Valley
groups that had allied with Maryland for mutual defense against the Susquehannocks.10
That changed in the early 1650s. Claiborne, having backed what was at the time the
winning side in the English Civil Wars (1642-1660), secured a commission to reduce
Virginia and Maryland to Parliaments authority. Arriving in Maryland in March 1652,
Claiborne's little navy quickly overwhelmed the small colony. Though the Susquehan-
nocks did not participate in the assault, they accepted Claiborne's invitation to enter into
a peace treaty with newly conquered Maryland, and by extension with the Piscataways
and other native allies of Maryland. Although the colony reverted to the Calvert family in
1657, the treaty between the Susquehannocks and Maryland remained in force.11

The 1652 treaty with Maryland did not truly make the Susquehannocks friends with
the Piscataways or with Maryland colonists, but it did give all parties a much-needed

respite. It provided the Susquehannocks security on their southern flank, which enabled
them to focus on their Five Nations enemies to the north. Thanks in part to their alli-
ances with Virginia and Maryland, they scored a number of victories against the Five Na-
tions throughout the 1660s and into early 1670s. Nevertheless, the conflict was bleeding
them to death. The Susquehannocks, reduced to perhaps three hundred warriors by the
early 1670s, needed to cultivate alliances more than ever. They hosted a visit from the
tayac (the Piscataways' hereditary chief), convinced Marylands government to provide
them with arms and ammunition, and developed relationships with Indian nations on
the southern Piedmont.12

By 1673 the war had turned decisively against the Susquehannocks. French Jesuit mis-
sionaries among the Five Nations reported that the Iroquois had "utterly defeated" the
Susquehannocks, "their ancient and most redoubtable foes." Maryland officials, who de-
spite the 1652 treaty had never warmed to or fully trusted their former Susquehannock
enemies, nevertheless invited the entire Susquehannock nation to move to Maryland. The
Susquehannocks soon took up residence at an abandoned village at the mouth of Piscat-
away Creek, directly across the Potomac River from a newly patented property that would
later become George Washingtons Mount Vernon. On Piscataway Creek the Susquehan-
nocks uneasily shared space on a reservation that had recently been created for the Pisca-
taways and the tayaes tributary nations.13

The Susquehannocks' move to the Potomac cut through the thin veil of amity between
them and the peoples of the Potomac, including colonists of Maryland, and re-exposed
the deeper history of conflict between those groups. Even as the Susquehannocks were
negotiating for possession of the town site at the mouth of Piscataway Creek, rumors
spread among the colonists "of the many murthers and outrages comitted ...
by the
Susquehanna Indians." Though false, these tales revealed how matters stood between the
Susquehannocks and their southern neighbors. Even more revealingly, shortly after agree-
ing to seat the Susquehannocks along the Potomac, the Maryland Assembly proposed

raising fiftythousand pounds of tobacco for peace negotiations with the Five Nations-
or, if need be, for war against the Susquehannocks. Nothing came of that plan, but clearly
the Susquehannocks could not trust their new neighbors. They could, however, count on
being harassed by frontier planters and by the Piscataways and other Potomac nations,
old enemies who had neither invited the Susquehannocks to live among them nor truly
accepted them as allies.14

It was at this juncture, in the summer of 1675, that the herdsman Robert Hen, some
twenty miles down the Potomac from the Susquehannocks, was slain by Doeg Indians in
retaliation for an earlier clash over a debt owed to the Doegs by Hen s master, the Virginia
planter Thomas Mathew. The following day a cabin full of unsuspecting Susquehannock
hunters awoke to a surprise attack by Virginia militiamen, who killed fourteen of their
number in reprisal for Hens killing. (It was a case of mistaken identity: the Doegs who
had killed Hen were in another cabin, only a few hundred yards away.) The Susquehan-
nocks now faced a serious dilemma: How were they to respond to these murders without
entering into a cycle of violence that might lead to their expulsion from their new tenu-
ously held home in the Potomac Valley and the loss of their critically important alliances
with Virginia and Maryland?15

The Susquehannocks chose, in essence, to return to an earlier era by revitalizing their
long-term alliance with Virginia. They limited themselves to killing two Virginians and
destroying some crops and livestock (because some response to the unprovoked murder
of the fourteen hunters was needed), but followed up with a peace overture to Virginia.
Their message to Governor Berkeley expressed grief that the Virginians had been "so eager
in there groundless quarill" but assured him that they were "content to renew, and con-
firme the ancient League of amety" with Virginia. The suggestion was neither unreason-
able nor unrealistic. Berkeley was nöt eager for a destructive and expensive war. (Mary-
land governor Charles Calvert, too, seemed more concerned about the threat to peaceable
Indian relations than about the retaliatory killings of several of his colonists.)16

Contrary to Susquehannock expectations, however, Virginia chose war. The situa-
tion had changed since the heyday of the Susquehannock-Virginia alliance in the 1620s,
1630s, and 1640s. The Susquehannocks needed Virginia as much as ever, but in the blunt
assessment of many colonists there was nothing to be gained by continuing the relation-
ship. Thanks to a combination of militia officers' creative interpretations of instructions
and political pressure from planters, by late September 1675 one thousand armed colo-
nists from Virginia and Maryland had descended upon the Susquehannock fort on Pis-
cataway Creek. Consistent with the long-term roots of the conflict, the militiamen were
aided by men from nearby Indian nations for whom this was just the latest in a series of
battles against the Susquehannocks.17

On the first full day of the siege the colonists seized and murdered five or six of the
Susquehannocks' leading men who had left the fort under a flag of truce. This time the

Susquehannocks' response was not so restrained. After a siege of six weeks in which many
more colonists than Indians were killed, the entire Susquehannock community escaped.
Most headed south to a refuge near the Virginia-North Carolina boundary. From there
they launched a series of retaliatory attacks, forcing frontier planters to cluster in pali-
saded compounds or to retreat to more thickly settled parts of the colony. The most vig-
orous colonial response, a march against the Susquehannocks' hideout on the Roanoke
River,led by the James River planter Nathaniel Bacon, was in defiance of the orders of
Governor Berkeley. It soon led to the conflict within Virginia that bore Bacons name.18
What, then, from a Susquehannock point of view, were the causes of Bacons Rebel-
lion? From this angle of vision, differences among Virginians do not loom large. The
long-term struggles against the Piscataways and the Five Nations come to the fore, and
actors and relationships that do not normally figure in accounts of the rebellion seem
much more important. Events in the northern Chesapeake mattered more than events
along Virginias James and York Rivers, where most colonists lived. From where the
Susquehannocks were standing, Bacon and his followers did not register as insurgents

against an unpopular governor-Bacon and Berkeley both sought to destroy the Susque-
hannocks, betraying the colony's longtime ally at the worst possible moment. Thus Ba-
cons march against the Susquehannocks' stronghold in the southern Piedmont in the
spring of 1676 did not appear as a critical moment in his struggle against Governor
Berkeley, but as yet another episode in what even many colonists called the Susquehan-
nock War.

Yet as the Occaneechees, Pamunkeys, and other neighbor Indians could attest, there
was a major difference between the governor and the rebel. Berkeley wanted to fight only
Susquehannocks, while the Baconites wished to rid Virginia of all Indians. The Susque-
hannock War was crucial to bringing out this riftamong the colonists, for it mobilized
anti-Indian sentiment throughout Virginia in a way that the localized conflict with the
Doegs never could. None of the numerous clashes between neighbor Indians and colo-
nists in recent decades had polarized colonists as the Susquehannock War did.19

What, then, was so special about the Susquehannocks? Simply put, they were the only
Indian nation within the Chesapeake region that could generate sufficient fear and pan-
ic throughout the colony for Bacon to turn the Susquehannock War into a general war
against the Indians. The Susquehannocks were more numerous than most of the neigh-
bor Indians, and their warriors were seasoned veterans of their long-term conflicts with
the Five Nations and with southern nations such as the Piscataways. Their settlements
lay beyond the reach of the colonists, and they were able to strike almost anywhere in
Virginia or Maryland except the Eastern Shore. Above all, the Susquehannocks' deeply
felt sense of betrayal at the hands of their Virginia allies, and their sense of desperation
and isolation given their recent misfortunes, inspired them to launch more deadly at-
tacks in more places than the colonists had experienced since the Anglo-Powhatan War
of 1644- a conflict that the vast majority of colonists knew only as a historical event.
Susquehannock raids extended from the falls of the James River in the south, where
Bacon and other planters had members of their households killed by Susquehannock
warriors, to Maryland in the north. In the face of such a formidable enemy colonists
retreated from the more exposed plantations, built fortifications for local defense, and
speculated about potential collaborations between their closest Indian neighbors and
the Susquehannocks. These conditions were uniquely conducive to an appeal such as
Bacon's.20

Bacon's Rebellion, then, was the product of both an accident- the Virginians' inad-
vertent attack on the sleeping Susquehannock hunters- and of a long regional history of
intra-Indian war and diplomacy that made the Susquehannocks the most desperate and
formidable enemy that Virginians had faced in over thirty years. That regional history was
primarily structured not by social or political divisions among the English, but rather by
the Susquehannocks' relationships with the Five Nations and the Piscataways. Unfortu-
nately for the Susquehannocks, the Piscataways and the Five Nations Iroquois remem-
bered that history well, and they sensed opportunity in the Susquehannocks' falling-out

with their longtime Virginia allies. They, rather than Bacons "volunteers," remained the
Susquehannocks' greatest military threat.

Indians were also central actors in the conduct of Bacons Rebellion, which was neither
two-sided (the governor vs. the rebel), nor three-sided (the governor vs. the rebel vs. the
Indians), but rather a multisided conflict in which most of the "sides" lay within Indian
country. On Virginias northern flank the rebellion played out within the same enduring
Native American diplomatic framework that Virginians and Marylanders had encoun-
tered when their colonies were first established. On the colony's southern flank, however,
the Baconites found themselves operating within a newer and even more complex Native
American diplomatic constellation.

The southern Piedmont had become a strategically important region for the Virginia
colony in recent years, largely in response to changes in patterns of war, diplomacy, and
exchange among Indian nations there. The fulcrum of Virginias Indian trade had shifted
after 1650 from the northern Chesapeake Bay to the falls of the Appomattox and James
Rivers, which was the best launching point for trading on the southern Piedmont. South-

ern deerskins and Indian slaves (captives taken in wars between Indian nations) replaced
northern beaver pelts as the traders' most desired commodities. In the 1670s the number
of Virginians competing for this southern trade was rising sharply.21

Southern Indians and Virginians who were interested in trading with one another had
to reckon with the Occaneechees, whose well-fortified town on an island at a shallow ford
across the Roanoke River was an important way station on the main north-south trad-
ing path across the Piedmont. Only with difficulty were southern Indians able to bypass
the Occaneechees to trade directly with the Virginians. Indeed, other Native Americans
in the region learned to speak the Occaneechees' language so that they could join in the
Virginia trade. The Occaneechees used their position to obtain English guns and ammu-
nition, which further strengthened their hand.22

Other Indian nations nevertheless competed with the Occaneechees, giving Virginia
traders alternative sources of slaves, pelts, and skins: the Tuscaroras, for example, who
lived to the southeast of the Occaneechees near the Carolina coast, and the much-feared
Richahecrians or "Westos," migrants from the north who since the 1660s had been raid-
ing Indian and Spanish mission towns as far south as Florida and as far west as the Ap-
palachian Mountains. The Westos found the slave trade so lucrative that after a brief stay
at the falls of the James River during the 1650s they decided to move closer to their vic-
tims. They took up new lands four hundred miles to the south on the Savannah River but
maintained their connections with Virginia traders.23

In the winter of 1675-1676 the Occaneechees gained a new neighbor and poten-
tial trading rival: the Susquehannocks, who, after their November escape from the siege
of their fort on the Potomac River, settled on the Roanoke River just above the Occa-
neechees' island. The Susquehannocks' presence on the southern Piedmont was awkward
and unsettling from the outset. Although the precise nature of the conflicts was never
spelled out in the English records, word soon spread that the Susquehannocks had run
afoul of "the other lesser nations of the Indians and so made them their Enimies."24

The Susquehannocks were well aware of their precarious situation and their dire need
for friends. In the winter of 1675-1676 they approached Edmund Andros, governor of
New York and New Jersey, about returning to the north. A few Susquehannocks came
and planted corn in the Delaware Valley that spring. Mostly, though, the Susquehannocks
sought Indian allies in the south. And where better to begin than with their closest and
most powerful neighbors, the Occaneechees? The Susquehannocks' overtures failed utter-
ly,however. Faced with a choice between their English trading partners and the Susque-

hannock newcomers, the Occaneechees sent messengers to tell the English where they
might find the Susquehannocks.25

As the Susquehannocks surely realized, many colonists in the winter and spring of
1676 were calling for an indiscriminate war of extermination against Indians. In March
the anti-Indian forces found their leader in Bacon, who accepted the leadership of a band
of "volunteers" gathering on the upper James River. Bacon represented their position in
an increasingly heated exchange of letters with Berkeley. The governor warned Bacon
that he was in mutiny and ordered him to come to Jamestown. Bacon insisted that he
desired "ever to be esteemed by your Honor as a loyall subject," but made excuses for
staying away. The frontiers needed guarding, and the Indians living within the Virginia
settlements especially bore watching. After all, asked the Baconites, "Are not the Indians
all of a Colour"? Berkeley laid plans for arresting the rebellious Bacon. Thus the Occa-
neechees' message revealing the location of the Susquehannock refugees was, for Bacon
and his followers, very timely. On May 2 Bacon struck out on an unauthorized expedi-
tion at the head of over one hundred "volunteers" to find and destroy the Susquehan-
nocks.26

Some days later the Occaneechees greeted Bacon at the north bank of the Roanoke
River opposite their town. Posseclay, the Occaneechees chief, gave the Virginians a warm
welcome and, after the Virginians had refreshed themselves, he revealed that the Susque-
hannocks had two forts nearby. One, five miles distant, was inhabited by at least thirty
warriors plus women and children, along with a smaller number of Manakin and Annal-
ectin warriors (from nearby Piedmont nations) whom the Susquehannocks had pressured
into joining them. Another fort, ten miles away, contained "a very considerable number
of men besides woeman and children." Bacon was eager to attack, but Posseclay insisted
that "your men are weary, and want sleep, and [are] not fittfor service." The Virginians,
Posseclay said, should "stay and Rest heer, and wee will Goe and take the Fort for you and
bring you an account of it."27

The Occaneechees plotted with the Manakin and Annalectin warriors within one of
the forts to turn against the Susquehannocks. Leaving behind the "weary and faint" Vir-
ginians, the Occaneechees attacked several days later. At their signal the Manakins and
Annalectins turned against their Susquehannock hosts, killing many of the towns 150 in-
habitants. Returning "with triumph" to the Virginians encampment, the Occaneechees
displayed the scalp of the Susquehannocks' "King" and brought seven Susquehannock
prisoners as a gift to Bacon, then tortured and killed them at his request. They also carried

home a small mountain of captured beaver pelts, which they stowed away.in their own
fort.28

To the Occaneechees' surprise, their feat was not enough. Bacon pestered the Oc-
caneechees to turn over the beaver pelts taken from the Susquehannock fort. Posseclay
insisted that his men had done all of the work and therefore should have all of the plun-
der. The wrangling wore on for hours until finally, after midnight, shots rang out and the
battle began. By the next afternoon over one hundred Occaneechees lay dead, and their
town was in ruins. The survivors hid in the woods until the Virginians left, then retreated
southward to a new settlement near what is now Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Bacons
volunteers rode in the opposite direction, northward to Virginia. Once there Bacon tout-
ed the destruction of the Occaneechees' town as "a greater victory from a sharper conflict
than ever yett has been known in these parts of the world."29

At this point it becomes useful, for comparisons sake, to step outside of the Native Ameri-
can framework to review the highlights of the intra-Virginian civil war that followed Bacons
return from the Occaneechees' island. As a number of historians have narrated, Bacon arrived
home just in time to participate in the elections for a new assembly, called for by Berkeley dur-
ing Bacons absence and scheduled to open in early June. Over the next few months Bacon was
elected as a burgess for Henrico County, arrested upon his arrival at Jamestown for the open-
ing of the June provincial assembly, pardoned after tendering humble apologies, escaped from
Jamestown, and returned in late June at the head of several hundred men to compel Berkeley
to grant him a military commission. In July Bacon forced Berkeley and his supporters to flee
to the Eastern Shore. The rebels briefly lost control of the capital in early September, expelled
Berkeleys men from Jamestown a second time on September 19, then burned the capital city
to the ground as the loyalists evacuated again to the Eastern Shore. Bacon died on October
26, most likely of typhus compounded by dysentery. A grinding partisan war ensued, with the
loyalists only completing their victory in mid-January 1677.30

Often glossed over in this narrative is that the rebels spent far more time in the field
against Indians than they did against Berkeleys forces. Bacon insisted all along that his
targets were Indians, and his actions generally bore that out. The "volunteers," he prom-
ised, would not bear arms against the governor unless he attacked Bacons forces from the
rear while they were out fighting Indians. This struck the right note with many Virgin-
ians, most of whom agreed not to hinder Bacon in this task. True to his word, after forc-
ing a commission from Berkeley to go out against the Indians at the end of June, Bacon
left Berkeley still in control of the government at Jamestown. Bacon assembled a volun-
teer army at the falls of the James River, hoping to go out again in search of the Susque-
hannocks. Only after Berkeley tried to raise forces against the rebels did Bacon turn back

to Jamestown, driving the governor out of the capital in late July and establishing a pro-
visional government in his absence.31

Bacon began to fight Indians in earnest after Berkeley retreated to the Eastern Shore
in July 1676. Deciding that the Susquehannocks and the Occaneechees were beyond his
army s reach in the vast southern interior, Bacon turned against the Pamunkeys and other
nations within the Virginia settlements. Even this proved more difficult than he antici-
pated when the Pamunkeys retreated into the thick woods and swamps north of the York
River and for many weeks could not be found by Bacon s increasingly tired and exasper-
ated troops. Most of his men had already gone home by the time Bacon finally stumbled
upon the Pamunkeys' camp in early September, taking numerous prisoners and forcing
their hereditary chief, Cockacoeske, to surrender a few days later.32

Having at last achieved some success against the Pamunkeys, Bacon returned to his
headquarters (Governor Berkeleys splendid Green Spring Plantation, near Jamestown)
and sent all but a few of his men home to recuperate. It was then that Berkeley returned
from the Eastern Shore and recaptured Jamestown without firing a shot. Bacon hastily
recalled his men and laid siege to the capital, expelling the loyalists after some intense
maneuvering and fighting. The siege lasted eleven days, a mere fraction of the time that
Virginians had already spent afield against the Susquehannocks, Occaneechees, Pamun-
keys, and the many other neighbor Indians who were being persecuted by their neighbors
in local areas throughout Virginia. Revealingly, as soon as Bacon finished mopping up
the loyalist resistance in the wake of Governor Berkeleys return to the Eastern Shore in
mid-September Bacon once again gathered his volunteers and went into the woods and
swamps in search of Indians. True to the central goal of the rebels to the end, Bacon died
in late October while campaigning against Indians, not against loyalists.33

Even the foregoing account, however, fails to capture the extent to which Native Amer-
icans, rather than Virginians, determined the conduct of Bacons Rebellion. The Pamun-
keys and other neighbor Indians ran Bacons men ragged by drawing them into thick
woods and wetlands where they exhausted their energy and supplies and rarely encoun-
tered Indians. Thus did Virginias Indian allies largely preserved themselves despite Ba-
cons best efforts to annihilate them. In the process they profoundly shaped the civil war
within Virginia by ensuring that the rebels were not at their best when they turned to
fight the loyalists.34

Moreover, the enduring diplomatic alignment among indigenous nations in the north-
ern Chesapeake also determined the conduct of Bacons Indian war. Although the Virgin-
ians (rebels and loyalists alike) had rejected the Susquehannock alliance, almost everyone
else (notably Maryland, the Piscataways and their tributaries, the Five Nations, and the
Susquehannocks) followed a script straight out of the sixteenth century (or, for Mary-
land, from the 1630s). While Bacons followers refused to distinguish between Indian

nations, Native Americans experienced no such difficulties. They clearly distinguished
their friends from their enemies.

Thus the Susquehannock War continued unabated throughout Bacon s Rebellion, car-
ried on by Indians-
particularly the Five Nations, the Piscataways, and the Piscataways'
tributaries- whose rocky relations with the Susquehannocks considerably predated 1675.
The Five Nations, aware that some Susquehannocks had taken refuge along the Delaware
River and that others were returning to the Susquehanna Valley in the wake of their defeat
by the Occaneechees in the spring of 1676, repeatedly threatened the Susquehannocks
with annihilation and captivity that summer, while also making serious diplomatic over-
tures using New York governor Edmund Andros as their intermediary. Both approaches,
it seems, were part of a larger design to at long last destroy the Susquehannocks as an in-
dependent nation and absorb its population into their own.35

The Piscataways' and the Marylanders' approach was less subtle than that of the Five
Nations, but no less true to form. Maryland stuck by its Piscataway allies, shielding them
from unprovoked attacks by Baconites and supporting the Piscataways as they seized the
opportunity to attack the Susquehannocks. Although the details of the fighting between
the Piscataways and the Susquehannocks were not recorded by colonial observers, by
May 1676 the Piscataways had already so earned the gratitude of Marylands government
that the assembly voted to reward their efforts with 130 barrels of corn, sixty pounds of
powder, two hundred pounds of shot, and over one hundred matchcoats (bolts of high-
quality trading cloth). The Mattawomans, a tributary nation to the Piscataways, earned
additional rewards. When Maryland considered opening peace talks with the Susquehan-
nocks in the spring of 1677 the Piscataways protested, making it clear that they would
rather "march with the English to the new Fort [the Susquehannocks] have built, or oth-
erwise to pursue the Susquehanoughs" as they retreated to the north.36

By then, however, officials in Virginia and Maryland wanted peace. The last of the
rebel forces disbanded on January 18, and later that month the first ships carrying
British troops arrived along with royal commissioners appointed to sort out the mess
caused by the rebellion. Disgraced, Berkeley was recalled to England. In May 1677
the royal commissioners negotiated the Treaty of Middle Plantation, in which the Pa-
munkeys and other Indian nations within Virginia agreed to accept Charles II as their
sovereign and to fight alongside Virginians against "forreigne" Indians whenever they
were asked. In return, the commissioners, confessing that the conflict had begun with
their own peoples' "violent Intrusions" against Indians, confirmed Native American
possession of their lands and their customary fishing, gathering, and hunting rights.

Bacons Rebellion in Indian Country

743

Although the Treaty of Middle Plantation acknowledged natives' distinctive status and
even their usefulness to Virginia, it was a major step in the colonys conquest of the na-
tions within.37

A second 1677 treaty, negotiated by Maryland, New York, and the Five Nations at
Albany shortly after the Treaty of Middle Plantation, introduced major changes to the
historic diplomatic configuration of the northern Chesapeake. An initial modification of
this system, the severing of the Susquehannock-Virginia alliance, had been accomplished
in 1675. Now, by the Albany Treaty of 1677, the Susquehannocks were allowed to return
north as dependents of the Iroquois; thus two of the regions major antagonists were fi-
nally reconciled. Yet the transformation was not complete. The Albany Treaty also estab-
lished peace (on paper at least) among the English colonies, the Five Nations, and their
respective Indian allies, including the Iroquois, the Susquehannocks, and the Piscataways.
If all had followed the terms of the treaty in the long term, the diplomatic framework that
had structured relations in the region since the sixteenth century would have been com-
pletely dismantled. Of course, that did not happen.38

Neither Bacons death in October 1676, nor the two Indian treaties of 1677, nor Berke-
leys death in July 1677 could resolve the issues that had sparked Bacon s Rebellion. The
dilemmas that lay at the heart of the conflict remained: for the "neighbor Indians," how
to survive; for the Occaneechees, how to hold their own amid the southern Piedmont s
intra-Indian wars, Indian slavery, migrations, and consolidations, which were intensify-
ing with the rapid expansion of the European economy into Indian country; and for
the Iroquois and their new Susquehannock clients, how to hold their own against other
northern nations, continue their raids against the Piscataways and other southern na-
tions without also becoming enmeshed in a war with the English, and maintain peace
with the English without losing their autonomy. Among colonial elites the challenge
was to relieve the pressures caused by planters' frustrations with the state of the colo-
- heavy war-related taxes, many Virginians' perceived political powerlessness, labor
ny
shortages, and other political and economic problems- without resorting to another
expensive and divisive Indian war that might lead to still more strife within Virginia
society.

The resolutions to these conflicts, as they unfolded over the next quarter century, came
almost entirely at the expense of Indians. Bacon's Rebellion marked the beginning of a
sharp decline in the ability of most Indian nations on the Eastern Seaboard to significant-
ly shape events, including not only among neighbor Indians such as the Pamunkeys and
Piscataways but also more among distant nations such as the Occaneechees and Westos.
At the end of the seventeenth century the balance shifted when Native American power
and autonomy rapidly (though far from entirely) eroded.

The forces that would eventually bring about this transition had already been set in
motion by the end of 1677: first, a rapid expansion of the Indian slave trade in the South-
east; second, a tacit, though temporary, postrebellion compromise among Virginians over
Indian policy; and third, the initial stirrings of a sense among colonists that a vast, even

cosmic, conspiracy between Indians and Catholics was underway. These forces culminat-
ed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689, which cleared the way for a more lasting
postrebellion settlement. Although some Indian nations continued to significantly shape
events and even to thrive in the wake of Bacon s Rebellion, it was increasingly common
for English fantasies about Indian power, rather than actual Indians, to drive events. With
a few important exceptions, by the early eighteenth century Indian power and autonomy
in the region was reduced to a fraction of what it had been in 1675. Native Americans,
options, even for relatively successful nations, became correspondingly fewer and less pal-
atable.

Virginias involvement in the Indian slave trade accelerated as a consequence of Bacons
Rebellion. In the 1650s and 1660s the Virginia Assembly had placed restrictions on the
enslavement of Indians, though these were often evaded. During Bacons Rebellion, how-
ever, numerous Occaneechees, Pamunkeys, and other Indians were seized and sold into
servitude. Provincial officials seized upon these wartime circumstances to legitimize the
expansion of Indian slavery, first in a 1676 statute and then in a provision of the Treaty of
Middle Plantation. After the rebellion, the void left by the Occaneechees abandonment
of their choice location astride the main trading path into the southern Piedmont meant
that Virginians could trade more freely with other groups.39

Fortuitously for the Virginia traders, the removal of impediments to the Indian slave
trade came at a moment whea an accelerating cycle of warfare, epidemics, and rivalries
between European powers was producing a sharp increase in the number of Indian cap-
tives available for sale into slavery within Virginia and the West Indies. By the turn of the
eighteenth century Indian slave raids for English markets had spread from the Carolinas
to Florida and the Mississippi River; all told, thirty thousand to fiftythousand southern
Indians were enslaved by the British between 1670 and 1715. Entire peoples disappeared
or were absorbed into more successful nations and confederacies, such as the Creeks, Ca-
tawbas, Cherokees, and Yamasees. Gaping holes in the map opened up as places once in-
habited by numerous small nations became buffer zones between a more limited number
of large nations.40

This late seventeenth-century expansion in the Indian slave trade coincided with a
period when planters were struggling to find a reliable source of unfree labor to sustain
the colonys tobacco economy. The quantity and quality of white indentured servants
available to planters had greatly declined since the 1650s, thanks to improved economic
conditions in England and increased opportunities for English migrants in other colo-

nies. The demand for enslaved Africans far outstripped the supply, a situation that would
change only at the very end of the 1690s. Thus Indian slaves provided a critical bridge
between a seventeenth-century labor system dominated by white indentured servants
and an eighteenth-century society founded upon the labor of enslaved Africans. Between
1670 and 1700 on the upper James River 40 percent of the slaves were Indians. Enslaved
children in particular were disproportionately Indians, as was revealed when a 1680 stat-
ute required county courts to record the ages of young slaves to determine whether their
owners had to pay the tax on those over the age of twelve. In Henrico County, the
center of the Indian slave trade, the court recorded thirty-three Indian children and
no "Negros." In other counties, between one-half and one-third of those recorded were
Indians.41

What about the neighbor Indians, whose status had been the key point of contention
between Baconites and loyalists? Virginias postrebellion governors resolved this tension
through a tacit compromise. On the one hand, they allowed colonists to stir up as much
trouble as they liked among distant southern nations and to profit from the increased
flow of Indian slaves that ensued. On the other hand, they returned to the prerebellion
status quo in which neighbor Indians were to be treated as allies, a less expensive way of
proceeding that still permitted them to be slowly ground down and dispossessed of their
lands and political power through the tried and true weapons of free-ranging colonial
livestock, epidemic diseases, unpredictable bursts of personal violence against Indians,
surveyors' instruments, and the court system.42

Baconites endured but did not fully accept this compromise. Rather than again di-
rectly confronting their provincial governments over the issue, however, Bacons heirs
bided their time and, critically, linked their campaign to annihilate the neighbor Indians
to the great crisis in English religious and dynastic affairs that dominated the nations
political life during the 1670s and 1680s. Bacons Rebellion coincided with a movement
during the 1670s to prevent Charles Us openly Catholic brother James, Duke of York,
from succeeding him as king. Widespread popular unrest in England took an increasingly
rabid anti-Catholic tone, and many people looked to the most appealing of Charles Us
illegitimate sons, the Duke of Monmouth, to claim the throne when Charles died. Thus
as the Baconites battled against the royal governor Berkeley in 1676 they took comfort
from rumors that they "need not fear the king, nor any force out of England ...
for the
king was dead and the people together by the ears & the Duke of York and the Duke of
Monmouth fighting."43

Late in 1676, while the royal commissioners were still under sail from England and
loyalist forces were just beginning to score major victories over the rebels, an anonymous
colonist penned a "Complaint from Heaven with a Huy and crye and a petition out of
Virginia and Maryland." Addressing himself to the king, Parliament, and the lord mayor
and alderman of London, the author wrote that Bacons death marked only the end of the
first act of "the late tragedy." The complaint expressed the sentiments of planters in north-
ern Virginia and Maryland who believed that even Bacons analysis of their troubles had

not gone far enough. Like Bacon, they rejected the distinction between Indian allies and
Indian enemies, but they further argued that Berkeley had been the dupe of a far more
sinister figure: Lord Baltimore, the proprietor of Maryland, a powerful Catholic with
close ties to Charles II and his brother James. Lord Baltimore, it was said, had arranged
a deadly alliance between Indians and "papists." He was secretly in league with the Iro-
quois, the neighbor Indians, powerful English Catholics, the French and their American
colonists, the Jesuits, and the Pope, the writer charged. All were part of a great conspiracy
to destroy English Protestantism.44

Rumors of this far-flung conspiracy gained traction throughout the late 1670s and
the 1680s, fueled in part by the one remaining continuity in the Chesapeake diplomatic
system that had otherwise been swept away by Bacons Rebellion and the two treaties of
1677: the Susquehannock War, now well into its second century and still showing no
signs of abating. Guided by the Susquehannocks who now lived among them, Five Na-
tions war parties targeted the Susquehannocks' oldest southern enemies, the Piscataways
and other "neighbor Indians" in Virginia and Maryland, and (more selectively) some col-
onists as well. In the late 1670s they attacked English households in Bacons old neighbor-
hood at the falls of the James River, and well into the 1680s they struck at both colonists
and neighbor Indians. As late as 1697 a Susquehannock war leader named Monges, who
"still had tears in his Eyes" when he thought of his peoples betrayal by their allies back in
the fall of 1675, conspired with a dissident Piscataway faction to foment a war between
the Piscataways, Virginia, and Maryland, thus tricking the Susquehannocks' enemies into
exacting revenge against themselves. Each Iroquois-Susquehannock raid, multiplied in
effect through the power of rumor, seemed to confirm the existence of the grand Indian-
Catholic conspiracy.45

Also fueling the panic was the rising power of Louis XIV within Europe, accompanied
by French colonial expansion into the interior of North America during the 1670s and
1680s. Conspiracy-minded colonists had no difficulty connecting the dots between the
growth of French power, the presence of French Jesuit missionaries among the Five Na-
tions, and Susquehannock-Iroquois raids on the Chesapeake frontier. They also had no
difficulty in believing that the neighbor Indians, including even the Piscataways, were se-
cretly plotting with the Iroquois and the French.46

The final and most frightening links in the plot, however, were made between Lon-
don and Versailles, between James II and Louis XIV. Many English Protestants, primed
by the long-running political struggle to exclude the Catholic James from the throne
during the 1670s and still thrilling to the Popish Plot of 1678-1681, expected a crisis
when Charles II died and James became king. James did not disappoint. After assum-
ing the throne in 1685 James took measures to lessen the persecution of Catholics in

England and continued his predecessor s drift away from an alliance with the Protes-
tant Dutch and toward Louis XIV and France. Conspiracy-minded English Protestants
on either side of the Atlantic went on high alert for signs that the cosmic struggle was
about to reach its climax. Wild rumors flourished especially in northern Virginia and
Maryland during the 1680s. Many believed that neighbor Indians and Catholic colo-
nists were merely biding their time before joining forces with the French, the Iroquois,
and England's Catholic fifth column. Frequent panics and near-uprisings punctuated
the decade.47

The breakthrough in resolving those tensions came in early 1689, when word arrived
of William of Oranges successful invasion of England and James Us flight to France.
It was a fraught moment throughout the colonies. How would the Glorious Revolu-
tion play out in the colonies, where the same sort of antipopery that drove the Glori-
ous Revolution in England made large segments of the populace suspicious of their
provincial governments? New York and the New England colonies, for example, had
their own uprisings in the name of the new, reliably Protestant king and queen, Wil-
liam and Mary.48

The governments of Virginia and Maryland were both highly vulnerable to rebellion
in 1689. Maryland, of course, was a proprietary colony ruled by Catholics, and the ruling
Calvert family was strongly associated with James II. A long-established, heavily Protes-
tant antiproprietary faction stood ready to take advantage of the overthrow of James II.
Virginias government was also suspect in the minds of many inhabitants. Having long
maintained amicable relations with the Catholics who ruled Maryland, Virginias rulers
too were suspected of treason, especially by neo-Baconites. The periodic panics over a
supposed Catholic-Indian conspiracy were nearly as disruptive in Virginia as they were
in Maryland and, indeed, often originated there rather than in Maryland. Even along the
James River, well to the south, it is evident from the phrasing of the scattered references
to Catholic-Indian conspiracy theories that the writers were referring to a commonly un-
derstood set of ideas.49

Virginia only narrowly avoided an uprising. As Daniel Richter has argued, "Virginia
seems to have refrained from the uprisings only because [Lord Howard of] Effingham
[James Us appointed governor] happened to have sailed for England shortly before word
of the revolution arrived." Thanks to Effingham's absence, the Virginia Council was free
to act decisively to forestall a rebellion in the name of William, Mary, and Protestantism.
Convinced that certain people were about to "Stirr up and Carry on a Rebellion," the
council hastened to proclaim William and Mary as the new monarchs. It also suppressed
dissent within Virginia by forcing seven "Notorious Actors in those Rebellious and Out-
ragious Actings" to put up very large bonds for their good behavior.50

Although the councils quick response forestalled an uprising in Virginia, it did not
prevent Virginians from promoting a neo-Baconite revolt in adjoining Maryland. Fu-
eled by rumors coming out of Virginia of an imminent Catholic-Indian attack, tacitly
encouraged by certain county elites in northern Virginia, and confident of support from
"our neighbour Collony of Virginia" due to their "friendship, vicinity, great loyalty, and
sameness of religion," Protestant Marylanders rose up in the name of William and Mary
to eject the proprietary government of the Catholic Lord Baltimore. Maryland became a
royal colony with reliably Protestant governors.51

The Glorious Revolution marked the triumph of Baconite Indian policies. The key fig-
ure in implementing those policies was Francis Nicholson, a former lieutenant governor
of New York, whom William and Mary appointed as the long-term lieutenant governor
of Virginia (1690-1692 and 1698-1704) and Maryland (1694-1698). Nicholson pre-
sided over the dispossession of one Indian nation after another. Almost every nation of
neighbor Indians lost land through illegal sales and through white settlers squatting on
their lands. The Pamunkeys, still in possession of a substantial reservation in the 1680s,
lost so much territory in the 1690s that not enough remained to support the population.
Some Piscaťaways gave up on Virginia and Maryland altogether, allying themselves with
the Five Nations and William Penn. Although much of the nation remained along the
Potomac, the Piscataways' hereditary chief and many others soon relocated to a new town
on the Susquehanna River. Their eventual acceptance of Iroquois protection in the early
eighteenth century marked the end, at last, of the Native American diplomatic system
that had given birth to Bacons Rebellion.52

By the first decade of the eighteenth century the major tensions underlying Bacons
Rebellion, both in Indian country and within colonial society, had subsided to the point
that it is possible to discern a new order, a new settlement, falling into place. The neigh-
bor Indians who remained were reduced to tiny reservations or completely dispossessed
(though they persist to this day as communities). In the north two major treaties made in
1701, one at Albany and the other at Montreal, established a new, stablç diplomatic sys-
tem centered on the Five Nations and their closest allies (New France, New York, and the
multiethnic Indian communities of the Susquehanna Valley); this Great Peace put an end
to the Susquehannock War. The cycle of war, captivity, and migrations in the south con-
tinued to work in favor of Virginias Indian traders, though increasingly their trade was
in deerskins: Virginians had less use for Indian slaves in the eighteenth century as major
changes in the Atlantic slave trade were for the first time making available large numbers
of the enslaved Africans that Virginians had long preferred.53

Bacons Rebellion in Indian Country

749

Historians seeking to understand Bacons Rebellion by focusing on Virginias planters,
servants, and enslaved Africans have taught us much about the workings of colonial
society and have confirmed the event s status as a landmark in American history. Yet
inward-looking studies of Virginia society in the era of Bacons Rebellion are inherently
- not only in terms of who is included in the story but also in terms of their
incomplete
explanatory power. Even the label "Bacons Rebellion" has inhibited understanding of
the conflict by framing it too narrowly, much as the label "Mexican-American War" has
obscured the centrality of Native Americans to that conflict. It is therefore time to fully
integrate Indians into tellings of Bacons Rebellion, and not merely as the people who
sparked an internecine struggle among English colonists.54

Viewing Bacons Rebellion from even a few strategically selected perspectives within
Indian country forces a reconsideration of its causes, conduct, and ultimate signifi-
cance. From the vantage point of the northern Chesapeake Bay, where this story began,
it looks as if the causes of the rebellion had less to do with internal divisions among
Virginians than with the Susquehannocks' long-term struggles against the Five Nations
and the Piscataways. These conflicts stretched back deep into the sixteenth century and
forward into the 1690s. As a result of this intra-Indian history the Susquehannocks
were uniquely positioned to frighten Bacons followers into a war against all Indians-
and against all who, like Governor Berkeley, stood between the rebels and Virginias
Indian allies.

The Susquehannocks' relations with other Indian nations also shaped the conduct and
the aftermath of Bacons Rebellion, beginning with their defeat at the hands of the Oc-
caneechees, continuing with their harassment by the Piscataways and other Indians, and
culminating in their eventual absorption into the Five Nations. From the standpoint of
the neighbor Indians who remained within the limits of the English settlements, Bacons
Rebellion marked a sharp downturn in their already shaky condition as independent na-
tions, partly because Bacon viewed their extermination as his primary task and partly be-
cause Baconite Indian policies prevailed after the Glorious Revolution. Viewed from the
southern Piedmont, the rebellion created a much-expanded market for the Indian slaves
being generated by that region s spiraling cycle of warfare and captivity in the last quarter
of the seventeenth century.55

Ironically, some Indian nations held their own or even gained strength as the issues at
play during the rebellion were slowly worked out during the 1680s and 1690s. On the
southern Piedmont the Catawbas, among others, held on by taking in people from newly
dispersed nations. Certain Shawnee bands profitted, for the time being, from the mael-
strom of wars and slave raids that characterized the era. (Among their victims were the
Westos, who had been successful slavers during the 1660s and 1670s.) The Creek Con-
federacy grew significantly by adding entire towns of newcomers seeking safety in num-
bers. To the north, too, the aftermath of the rebellion had varied effects. The Susquehan-
nocks, Piscataways, and other groups were subordinated to and in some respects absorbed
into the Five Nations, but as a consequence of this (together with the treaties of 1677 and

Mexican War(New Haven, 2009).

1701) the Five Nations, faced with serious crises of their own during the late seventeenth
century, gained a new lease on life.56

In the long run colonists in the Chesapeake Bay region benefitted either way, capital-
izing on the successes of some Indian nations by buying Indian slaves from the victors
in the intra-Indian wars that were expanding throughout the South. On their northern
flank Virginians and Marylanders enjoyed a peace dividend thanks to their post- 1677 al-
liance, however shaky, with the Five Nations. The ultimate result was less conflict with the
Susquehannocks and Iroquois, especially after the 1690s. After the turn of the eighteenth
century, the Five Nations' role in the final demise of the indigenous diplomatic system
that had structured relationships in the northern Chesapeake since the sixteenth century,
together with the rise of the Five Nations to diplomatic primacy in the northern Chesa-
peake, were of critical importance to Virginians and Marylanders: for the first time they
could seriously contemplate the expansion of colonial settlements into the vast interior
above the fall line.57

The story of Bacons Rebellion, then, covers far more territory and a much longer time
span than we have been led to believe. The origins of and the working solutions to the
problems exposed by Bacons Rebellion were forged as much in Indian country as they
were within the heart of Virginia. Even then, of course, those solutions did not bring
about stability or closure. Human affairs simply do not work that way. Instead, the reso-
lution of the long-term conflicts that found expression during Bacons Rebellion raised
another set of issues: in the north, the role of Pennsylvania, the Five Nations, and their
dependents along the Susquehanna River in the grand struggle that was emerging be-
tween the French and the English for control of eastern North America; and in the south,
thè constantly building pressure caused by what the anthropologist Robbie Ethridge has
characterized as a vicious cycle "of debt, slaving, militarization, and warfare." These crises
and their resolutions would mark other new departures, other critical turning points, in
American history.58
