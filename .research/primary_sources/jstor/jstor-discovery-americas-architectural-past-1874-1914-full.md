 The Discovery of America's

 Architectural Past , 18/4-1914

 T «Lhe

 «Lhe discovery and celebration of America's

 architectural past began well before 1874.
 True, Thomas Jefferson in 1781 and Louisa
 Tuthill in 1848 had uncomplimentary
 things to say about the country's old build-
 ings, and from London in 1873 came James
 Fergusson's widely read opinion that be-
 fore 1814 "there was hardly one single
 building erected in North America . . .
 worthy of being mentioned as an example
 of Architectural Art."1 Yet as early as the
 1790S the Reverend William Bentley, an an-
 tiquarian cited by Abbott Lowell Cum-
 mings as "New England's first architec-
 tural historian/' described seventeenth-
 century buildings in diary entries.2 Wash-
 ington Irving wrote amusingly about the
 quaint architecture of the Hudson Valley
 Dutch, but took it seriously enough to re-
 build one of their old stone houses for his

 own use in 183s.3 Architects Benjamin La-
 trobe, William Strickland, and John Hub-
 bard Sturgis recorded the appearance of
 vanishing landmarks,4 while Arthur Gil-
 man, Thomas Tefft, and Richard Upjohn
 in the mid-nineteenth century wrote ad-
 miringly of designs from a century earlier.5
 The 1870s were marked by celebrations
 of the centennial of independence and a
 new zeal for recording old buildings, espe-
 cially as sources for the rising colonial re-
 vival. In 1874 students of Professor William
 Robert Ware at the Massachusetts Insti-

 Georgian church towers in Boston. Two
 were published in the Architectural Sketch
 Book (1875; fig. 1). By 1874 William Edward
 Barry, a draftsman in the Boston office of
 Peabody and Stearns, had published Pen
 Sketches of Old Houses (fig. 2). 6 Also in
 1874 a photo of Bishop Berkeley's house
 (1728) near Newport, Rhode Island, ap-
 peared in the New-York Sketch Book , ed-
 ited by Charles McKim. It showed the pic-
 turesque rear roof of the Berkeley house,
 but McKim' s taste was broad enough so
 that he later published the Georgian en-
 trance of the Ford house (Washington's
 headquarters; fig. 3) in Morristown, New
 Jersey, drawn by Bassett Jones, and the for-
 mal classicism of New York City Hall,
 "the most admirable public building in the
 city." McKim argued for the "architectural
 merit" of these buildings in the face of
 those who considered them "ugly." McKim
 himself was then a colonial revivalist (e.g.,
 in his Blake house of 1875), but he did not
 believe it was enough to gather graphic
 documentation of colonial buildings. He
 insisted it was time that architects "write
 about them as Architecture," in contrast
 to popular magazines such as Harper's
 where colonial buildings were illustrated
 simply as a quaint background for "some
 story or other."7

 In 1876 architects and architectural stu-

 dents were invited to submit "careful

 tute of Technology measured and drew late

 drawings" for publication in a new journal,

 the American Architect and Building
 News. These drawings, including plans and
 details, would surpass in value the "pic-
 turesque views published in books and
 magazines." It was observed that "the ar-
 chitecture of the Colonies" stemmed from

 England and the "narrow formalities of the
 Georgian period." The writer on the one
 hand condemned this colonial work as
 "feeble, lifeless, monotonous," while on
 the other proposing that its "ancestry was
 good. . . . the precepts of Vignola and Pal-
 ladio had been translated, illustrated, and
 codified, by Wren and Chambers" and ap-
 plied by "skilful mechanics" to American
 buildings.8

 Boston architect Robert S. Peabody was
 impressed by the English revival of the
 "Queen Anne" on an 1876 visit9 and soon

 came to advocate that Americans revive
 the colonial, which he thought equivalent
 to the Queen Anne, as "our legitimate field
 for imitation" and "our only native source
 of . . . inspiration." His taste ran to the
 "picturesque pile" of the Fairbanks house
 in Dedham, but more to "Georgian
 houses" like the Vassall-Longfellow house
 in Cambridge, which provided "the richest
 and finest models." He thought classical
 details had been "the common language of
 every carpenter, and treated freely . . . with
 no superstitious reverence for Palladio or
 Scamozzi, those bugbears of later years."
 Peabody' s sketches of "old houses at Lenox
 and Little Harbor" (fig. 4), which accom-
 panied his essay, confirmed his dual enthu-
 siasms for picturesque compositions and
 Georgian details, as did Peabody and

 Milton, Massachusetts (1877-1878). 10

 By 1878 Peabody's research led him to
 downplay the freedom of Georgian classi-
 cism. "The use of classical detail was uni-

 versally agreed to, and the orders were nat-
 urally used by every carpenter/' He
 discovered "a large copy of Batty Langley's
 classical work in an old loft in New Hamp-
 shire," which he took as firm evidence that
 colonial builders habitually referred to
 English handbooks for classical details.
 Further, he concluded that Asher Benja-
 min's American Builder's Companion had
 been influential in the detailing of early
 nineteenth-century houses east öf the
 Connecticut River. Therefore he advised
 his fellow colonial revivalists to study
 these books as well as make their own

 sketches of old work.11 Peabody's assump-
 tion that the colonial era in American ar-

 chitecture continued into the early nine-
 teenth century was widely accepted at least
 through 1914.12

 In July 1877 Peabody and Arthur Little, a
 draftsman in Peabody's office, studied co-
 lonial houses in Portsmouth, New Hamp-
 shire. Little's New England sketches of
 that summer were published in 1878 as
 Early New England Interiors (fig. 5), prob-
 ably the first in the long line of books il-
 lustrating colonial buildings explicitly in-
 tended as a reference for designers and with
 a minimum of text. Little's career as de-

 signer of colonial revival houses began in
 1879 with Cliffs, a house in Manchester,
 Massachusetts.13 A reviewer found Little's

 drawings heavy-handed and lacking detail,
 but acknowledged the patriotic appeal of
 native models and suggested that the study
 of colonial architecture through measured
 drawings become a required part of archi-
 tectural training.14

 More than twenty years earlier, in 1854,
 George Champlin Mason, Sr., an artist and
 journalist in Newport, had published a
 tourist guide to the area where his family
 had long been prominent. Buildings were
 of interest for the historical events and per-
 sonages connected with them, but the de-
 signs of some eighteenth-century build-
 ings also met with his approval. In 1858 he
 began practicing architecture in Newport
 (his 1874 addition to Peter Harrison's Red-

 wood Library has been called "sensitively
 conceived") while continuing to write lo-
 cal history with an architectural emphasis.
 Proclaiming himself "fond of antiquarian
 research," Mason discovered documents to
 help establish a chronology of eighteenth-
 century Newport houses. He also com-
 pared design elements such as wainscoting
 details as an aid to dating these houses.
 Peter Harrison was praised for his "fidelity
 to the rules of classic architecture," and
 his work represented "a noble protest
 against the shams and affectations too
 prevalent in modern work."15

 George Champlin Mason, Jr., followed

 his father into an architectural career

 joined with the study of Newport's archi-
 tectural history. According to David Chase,
 the younger Mason became a specialist in
 colonial restorations in the early 1870s,
 while at the same time referring to the
 colonial tradition in new work. In 1879 he
 published the "definitive analysis" of the
 controversial Old Stone Mill in Newport,
 which led to his appointment as chairman
 of an American Institute of Architects

 committee to study the "Practice of Amer-
 ican Architects and Builders during the

 Colonial Period and First Fifty Years of In-
 dependence/'

 His report, published in 1881 in the
 American Architect , admitted that the im-
 petus for the study was the attempt to find
 American sources equivalent to the Eng-
 lish Queen Anne. But he was emphatic
 that his architectural history was not to be
 "merely . . . find[ing] quaint details to
 copy in modern work and then unblush-
 ingly christen those works Queen Anne or
 Georgian." His illustrations were too small
 and rough to be useful to the copyist. In-
 stead, he hoped to find "the principles that
 shaped and guided" early architecture by
 uncovering ancient documents and prob-
 ing the old buildings themselves. He
 analyzed building contracts and bills,
 construction techniques, even mortar in-
 gredients. The roles of particular builders
 and architects, the origins of the gambrel
 roof, and the general question of stylistic
 development were all explored. Seven-
 teenth-century houses belonged to the first
 period of American colonial architecture
 and were "ruder erections" than their
 eighteenth-century successors, whose
 classicism he favored. Eighteenth-century
 houses were categorized as second (c. 1700-

 1725) or third (c. 1730- ?) period- differenti-
 ated by materials, construction methods,
 roof types, and elegance of classical orna-
 ment. Like Peabody and Little, Mason ad-
 mired early nineteenth-century architec-
 ture, and he concluded his report with a
 description of Benjamin's American Build-
 er's Companion (advertised in Newport in
 1807). 16 As A. J. Bloor pointed out, Mason's
 report was narrowly focused on Newport,
 but Mason considered his essay only pre-
 liminary and suggestive for further work
 by others.17

 Mason's quest for documents and prin-
 ciples had no appeal for Frank E. Wallis,
 who, as a young Boston draftsman, about
 1875 followed Little as a sketcher and wan-
 derer "in the pleasant land of Colonial ar-
 chitecture." While acknowledging Little's
 influence, Wallis was more thorough in
 spending seven or eight years measuring
 and drawing old New England buildings af-
 ter office hours and on holidays. William
 Rotch Ware, editor of the American Archi-
 tect , at first refused to publish Wallis'
 measured drawings; he had been accus-
 tomed to printing picturesque sketches.
 But after William Robert Ware (then at Co-
 lumbia) admired them and apparently used
 them as models for his students' summer
 work, William Rotch Ware bowed to his
 uncle's opinion and published them in the
 American Architect in 1886. Subsequently
 Wallis made two trips to the South to
 gather additional material. These efforts
 resulted in his Old Colonial Architecture

 and Furniture (1887; fig. 6), sixty plates re-
 producing Wallis' drawings, interior and
 exterior details (some drawn to scale), as
 well as perspective sketches. The subjects
 ranged from Massachusetts to Virginia;
 most were eighteenth-century houses. Fol-
 lowing Peabody, Wallis' short introduction
 assured "the student of Architecture" that
 American architecture from 1750 to 1800
 was founded in "the classic of Palladio and

 Vignola."18

 Wallis' book has been called "the first

 collection of measured drawings to appear
 in book form in this country, and as such
 it attracted much attention."19 It was val-
 ued as a source for colonial revivalists (of
 which Wallis was one). He claimed that
 when he "measured, sketched, and studied

 the old houses/' he was not calculating the
 profit from wide distribution of his plates,
 but experiencing "a strong stirring of emo-
 tion, being one generation removed from
 this type" of house. "I have lived in a home

 and with a grandmother and her daughter

 house and the House of Seven Gables, pre-
 sented fifty photographic plates, but no
 text, and the captions included no dates.
 The plates reflected Chandler's preference
 as a colonial revivalist for eighteenth- and
 early nineteenth- century houses: the sev-
 enteenth century was unrepresented and
 only two public buildings were recorded.26

 In the 1890s several variants on Wallis'
 publications appeared.21 James M. Corner
 and Eric Ellis Soderholtz, photographers,
 pioneered the publication of "photo-
 graphic documentation of colonial archi-
 tecture in book form." In compiling Ex-
 amples of Domestic Colonial Architecture
 in New England (1891) they frankly admit-
 ted their "primary object . . . was not to
 accumulate historical data." Instead their
 plates were meant to be useful to archi-
 tects "in stimulating closer study [of colo-
 nial houses] in their adaptation to modern
 domestic work." Since seventeenth-cen-

 tury houses of the "Colonial Period"
 lacked "refinement in the way of elaborate
 detail," and those from the "Provincial Pe-
 riod" (c. 1700-1776) were only modestly en-
 riched, the compilers emphasized "the
 better class of domestic edifices" from the
 later eighteenth century or "Federal Pe-
 riod" (c. 1776-1800).22

 Charles McKim commended the compil-
 ers for the choice of material and its pres-
 entation. "It is in constant daily use in our
 office, and ... we consider no Architec-
 tural Library complete without it."23 (An-
 other fan of photographs as design sources
 was Joy Wheeler Dow, who recommended
 photographic study as easier than traveling
 to see the originals, and "pictures are ot-
 tener productive of inspiration than . . .
 actual acquaintance with the subjects."24)
 Corner and Soderholtz were criticized in

 the American Architect for omitting color
 plates, but such rarely appeared in archi-
 tectural publications . Lithographically
 tinted illustrations of "Colonial Building
 in New Jersey," appearing in the Architec-
 tural Record in 1894, were the exceptions.25
 Like Corner and Soderholtz' s volume,
 Joseph Everett Chandler's Colonial Archi-
 tecture of Maryland , Pennsylvania , and
 Virginia (1892) was scarcely "history."
 Chandler, a young Boston architect later
 known as the restorer of the Paul Revere

 Where Chandler ventured south as an

 outsider, T. Henry Randall wrote "Colo-
 nial Annapolis" for the Architectural Rec-
 ord (1892) as a member of the Annapolis
 aristocracy who went on to practice archi-
 tecture in New York. Randall noted re-

 gional distinctions that carried over from
 the character of individuals to their archi-

 tecture: New England was marked by pu-
 ritanical "simplicity and frugality," while
 the South of the "Cavalier" had "the
 stamp of refinement [and] elegance . . .
 borrowed from the old homes of England."
 Later in the Architectural Record , G. A. T.
 Middleton took up these prototypes in his
 "English 'Georgian' Architecture: The
 Source of the American 'Colonial' Style."27
 A broader historical overview was at-

 tempted by Montgomery Schuyler, cred-
 ited by Frank Roos with writing "the first
 history of Colonial architecture."28 It ap-
 peared in 1893 in the Architectural Record.
 By "colonial" Schuyler meant only En-
 glish-influenced eighteenth- and nine-
 teenth-century architecture before the
 Greek revival. Seventeenth-century struc-
 tures, as well as Dutch and Swedish houses
 in New York and Pennsylvania, were
 "building," not architecture. Nevertheless,
 perhaps because of his Dutch ancestry,
 Schuyler did treat Dutch building in the
 Hudson Valley. Generally, he was con-
 cerned with chronology (the dates of the
 first brick kilns and sawmills; could St.
 Luke's, Newport Parish, be so early as
 1632?), authorship (St. Michael's, Charles-
 ton, was attributed to James Gibbs), the
 quality of workmanship (high in the case
 of Independence Hall) and materials (wood
 should not be employed externally), the
 correct use of the orders (the fragmented
 entablatures inside Christ Church, Phila-
 delphia, were criticized), the quality of
 compositions (high in the case of the Uni-
 versity of Virginia), the rise of the archi-
 tectural profession (Bulfinch was "the first

 educated American" to become a profes-
 sional architect), and the claims of Phila-
 delphia and Boston for "superiority in the
 polite arts" (Philadelphia won). Schuyler's
 bibliography included local histories,
 eighteenth-century regional descriptions,
 Jefferson's Writings , and Chandler's Colo-
 nial Architecture.19

 Soon after the appearance of Schuyler's

 essay, a jejune survey by O. Z. Cervin,

 appearance in the daily papers of accounts
 of the destruction by fire of this or that
 ancient building endowed with historic or
 architectural interest."

 The Georgian Period served mainly as a

 bundle of sources for designers. Ware sup-
 posed that if his "comprehensive work"
 had existed twenty years earlier, architects
 would not have produced, out of igno-
 rance, so many "caricatures" of " 'Old Co-
 lonial' work." Yet twenty years earlier the
 camera and "ever-wandering amateur pho-
 tographer," so necessary for the project,
 were scarcely in evidence.32

 the United States," originally a post-grad-
 uate thesis for the Architectural Depart-
 ment at Columbia College, was published
 in the American Architect. Cervin an-
 nounced that colonial Philadelphia had no
 notable architecture because it had been
 ruled by "world-eschewing zealots," and
 "Williamsburg . . . never became impor-
 tant - it stands today, with a church and a
 court-house, almost the identical country
 town it was a hundred years ago." Thomas
 Jefferson "did many queer things."30
 The editors of the American Architect

 Reviews of The Georgian Period were
 generally favorable. A laudatory review of
 the first three parts in the Nation sug-
 gested the inclusion of an appendix docu-
 menting the "less academic . . . simple
 clapboarded houses, with overhanging sec-
 ond-story pendants." Ware later added such
 seventeenth-century New England exam-
 ples, noting their inferiority in "architec-
 tural character" to houses of "the Geor-

 did not demand much substance in the

 historical essays they printed. Claude
 Bragdon forthrightly announced that his
 article on colonial Salem was the fruit of

 one evening's "cramming at the Boston
 Public Library" and his drawings were
 based on six hours spent in Salem with his
 "note-books, rules, and pencils, and a ko-
 dak camera." Bragdon's essay on the Gen-
 esee Valley rambled on about fox hunting,
 he acknowledged, because there was "so
 little to be said" about its architecture that

 gian period," but finding them still "vastly
 interesting and picturesque."33 In 1915
 Richard Franz Bach surveyed the bibliog-
 raphy on colonial architecture and con-
 cluded that The Georgian Period was "the
 best general work ... for the detailed study
 of Colonial architecture," and as late as
 1923 it was said that "no book of its char-
 acter . . . has exercised a more profound,
 a more enduring or more wholesome
 influence."34

 could not be found in his drawings.31

 Between 1898 and 1902 William Rotch
 Ware, editor of the American Architect ,
 published The Georgian Period, a haphaz-
 ard compilation of material extending into
 the Greek revival, much of which had al-
 ready appeared in the American Architect.
 The Georgian Period was composed of
 twelve parts with some 450 plates includ-
 ing measured drawings, perspective
 sketches (fig. 7), and Heliotype photos,
 along with more than 500 smaller illustra-
 tions scattered amid the short articles by
 authors such as Cervin and Bragdon. Ware
 attributed the undertaking to "the formi-
 dable attempt to bring about the destruc-
 tion of the 'Bulfinch Front' of the Massa-

 chusetts State House . . . and the constant

 Superficiality did not mark the work of

 Norman Isham, an architect who ap-
 proached the history of early Rhode Island
 and Connecticut houses as a problem to be
 probed "scientifically." His Early Rhode Is-
 land Houses (1895) and Early Connecticut
 Houses (1900, • fig. 8), 35 both coauthored by
 Albert F. Brown, presented a collection of
 "scientific data" with a thoroughness pre-
 viously unknown in American architec-
 tural studies. They examined the houses
 described, prepared measured plans, sec-
 tions, and elevations, searched probate in-
 ventories to discover room names and uses.

 Consequently their work, they believed,
 would surpass in usefulness "the vague de-
 scriptions of too many of our town histo-
 ries."36 By surveying the oldest houses,
 they went against the tendency to concen-

 tagon House in Washington by William
 Thornton was among the buildings Brown
 published in the American Architect , and
 William Bushong proposes that Brown was
 thereby stimulated to study other works
 by Thornton, notably the United States
 Capitol.40

 In 1896 Brown began a series of articles
 on "The History of the United States Cap-
 itol," which resulted in his monumental
 two-volume opus with 322 folio plates,
 based on ten years of gathering written and
 drawn documentation from public and pri-
 vate sources. Brown's lifelong concern to
 document, preserve, and restore old Wash-
 ington may be traced partly to ancestral
 piety. While most writers on colonial ar-
 chitecture could claim colonial ancestors,
 Brown took pride in the fact that his
 grandfather, Bedford Brown, had repre-
 sented North Carolina in the Senate and

 his great-grandfather, Peter Lenox, had
 been a construction superintendent at the
 Capitol between 1817 and 1829. Still, in his
 first volume (covering the Capitol's his-
 tory to 1850), Brown was not primarily
 concerned with glorifying his ancestors,
 but rather, as Bushong demonstrates, with
 instructing his contemporaries in govern-
 ment that L'Enfant' s plan for the city was
 to be respected and that they should follow
 Washington's and Jefferson's example in
 seeking expert advice on the planning of
 government buildings. "Brown's History
 was a polemical study," Bushong asserts,
 "calculated to be the cornerstone of an ALA

 campaign to acquire a City Beautiful plan
 for Washington."41

 The New York architect Aymar Embury
 II, finding New England and Virginia well
 studied for revival purposes, turned to the
 old Dutch houses near New York, which
 had the advantage of being "little known"
 yet "beautiful, and full of suggestion to
 both the architect and the home-builder."

 To Embury they seemed full of "family
 feeling, sturdy and virile, like the Dutch-
 men who occupied them," but Irving' s in-
 fluence still dictated that Embury should
 also detect "the quaintness and sly humor
 that we instinctively associate with the
 nephews of Father Knickerbocker."42
 As a tourist-architect in search of the

 trate on Georgian examples. In fact their
 work seems to have been less inspired by a
 desire to fulfill the needs of the colonial
 revivalist (although Isham designed colo-
 nial revival houses37) than to produce dis-
 interested scholarly documentation of
 "help to the future historians of New Eng-
 land." Russell Sturgis lauded Isham and
 Brown for concentrating on buildings
 "handed down from father to son and for

 which no architect made plans/' consider-
 ing their Rhode Island volume "the most
 important contribution so far made to the
 history of American art."38

 Another architect whose painstaking
 historical scholarship remains impressive
 is Glenn Brown, whose measured drawings
 of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-cen-
 tury buildings in Virginia, Maryland, and
 Washington were published in the Ameri-
 can Architect in 1887-1888. He not only
 sketched and measured, but also at-
 tempted "researches or inquiries," includ-
 ing interviews of the oldest inhabitants.
 He turned up, in a Virginia warehouse,
 copies of Langley (1739) and William Pain
 (1794), which he recognized as the guides
 for carpenters and builders whose "free"
 but "refined treatment of Classical de-

 tails" Brown so much admired as a de-

 signer of colonial revival houses.39 The Oc-

 chitecture, Embury published his impres-
 sions of "Old New Orleans" - the "exqui-
 site faded tints" of the stuccoed walls and

 "delightful ironwork of the balconies" -
 while also writing appreciatively of Penn-
 sylvania's old stone farmhouses with clas-
 sical details "modified ... by ignorant (al-
 though tasteful) builders." Dates and even
 names of buildings were of little conse-
 quence. What was important was for archi-
 tects around the country to avoid the
 "stereotyped" colonial and to study forms
 that heretofore had had only a local influ-
 ence on the colonial revival.43

 Embury's Early American Churches

 (1914) was recognized as the standard refer-
 ence on the topic. He traveled to old
 churches, perused Benjamin's handbooks,
 and tried to use the art historical concept
 of attributing authorship on the basis of
 style, but much of his text was drawn from
 a reading of The Georgian Period and
 Schuyler. He preferred the early nine-
 teenth-century New England churches of
 Bulfinch, Benjamin, and Isaac Damon: the
 latter' s church at Ware, Massachusetts (fig.
 9), was "simple, extremely dignified, ec-
 clesiastical . . . , filled with the truest ar-
 chitectural feeling for proportion and de-
 tail." On the other hand, Quaker meeting
 houses were too plain to be of architectural
 interest and, politically, Quakers had
 been "objectionable nuisances," so their
 buildings failed as landmarks of American
 patriotism.44

 The study of American architectural his-
 tory was still unsystematic in 1914. Terms
 such as "colonial" and "Georgian" were
 used with the utmost freedom.45 The need

 for monographs on architects such as Sam-
 uel Mclntire was recognized but not met.46
 As Fiske Kimball complained that year:
 "There has been too much inconsequent
 fantasy-spinning, in writings on the his-
 tory of American architecture. The 'Geor-
 gian Period' itself feebly points to wide dis-
 agreements in its own pages as to the dates
 of important buildings- a confession of our
 historical incompetence unthinkable in
 any other country. Mr. Brown's painstak-
 ing and scholarly history of the Capitol . . .
 [is] almost the only worthy monument of
 our architectural history." Subsequently
 Kimball also hailed Isham for relating "in-

 ternal and documentary evidences" in
 tracing the development of early houses in
 New England.47

 ican Churches (Garden City,

 In 1969 John Maass criticized American
 architectural historians for adhering to a
 "bourgeois standard" and "genteel tradi-
 tion," which prevented them from study-
 ing buildings for the lower class and works
 of engineering. Earlier writers of American
 architectural history rarely ventured into
 these areas. T. Henry Randall focused on
 the Cavalier's grand house, while noting
 in passing that slaves "had to be provided
 for in quarters conveniently near, and yet
 not under his own roof." A grist mill and
 its construction details were not likely to
 interest colonial revival architects of 1889,
 so an article on the topic (based on an ex-
 amination of the mill at Philips Manor on
 the Hudson) logically appeared in Carpen-
 try and Building.48

 By 1914 the American public had been
 bombarded with publications bringing its
 architectural heritage to light. In addition
 to those by architects and architectural
 critics, which have been the focus of this
 paper, countless local histories and maga-
 zines such as Harper's and Scribneťs pre-

 existing relics the life and history of the
 times."51

 Preservationists used history to bolster
 their cause, as in the case of the History of
 the Old South Church (18 76; fig. 11), where
 the building's history was subordinated to
 events in the Revolution.52 Women were
 apparently the main audience for popular
 accounts of "social and domestic life" in
 colonial homes such as Anne Hollings-
 worth Wharton's Through Colonial Door-
 ways (1893; fig. 12). Mary H. Northend
 found the "greatest charm" in "ancestral
 homes that have descended from genera-
 tion to generation in the same family."53
 Genealogy was mixed with a little archi-
 tectural history in Thomas Allen Glenn's
 Some Colonial Mansions and Those Who

 Lived in Them (1899). 54 New Americans,
 immigrants, might become fully Ameri-
 canized by being exposed to pictures of pa-
 triotic landmarks, thought New York's
 blueblood-run City History Club. On the
 other hand, Samuel Adams Drake, the an-
 tiquarian author of Our Colonial Homes
 (1894), was angered that Paul Revere' s
 house (fig. 13) in Boston's North End
 was surrounded by "dirty tenements
 swarm [ing] with greasy, voluble Ital-
 ians."55 Children found engravings of colo-
 nial sites and patriotic shrines in their
 texts, and adolescent girls could read in
 Kate Douglas Wiggin's Mother Carey's
 Chickens (1911), a description of the "im-
 pressive" facade of the "Colonial" Yellow
 House pictured on the cover (fig. 14). 56

 Guidebooks catered to the patriotic and
 antiquarian sentiments of their touring
 readers. Thus a Pennsylvania Railroad
 guide in 1875 featured both Independence
 Hall and an old mill on the Conemaugh; a
 1903 trolley guide pointed out Washing-
 ton's headquarters in New Jersey, while a
 guide for "automobile parties" in 1907 (fig.
 15) directed them to "quaint inns and hos-
 telries." Postcards of these inns and other

 sented illustrations of old landmarks.49
 Some local historians such as Thompson
 Westcott used colonial buildings as start-
 ing points for chapters on family histo-
 ries.50 Martha J. Lamb wove biography and
 architectural history together in The
 Homes of America (1879; fig. io); more than
 a third of which covered the "Colonial Pe-
 riod" and such great houses as Stratford
 that "reveal more truthfully than any other

 historic sites were not only souvenirs for
 pilgrims, but also made a wider public
 aware of colonial architecture.57

 Discoverers of colonial architecture were

 mobile. John Martin Hammond, a self-de-
 scribed "collector of old houses" with his
 camera, advised other would-be collectors
 that they must also possess "a fine power

 The English-born Le Gallienne supposed
 that "the sense of the past as a still living
 presence can be more fully experienced, on
 occasion, here in America than in Eu-
 rope."58 Many (probably most) architects

 nial architecture were attracted to it as

 wrote, "our only native source of . . . in-

 in the late eighteenth century had pro-
 claimed the German roots and character of

 Gothic architecture, and David Watkin has

 part of this new historical preoccupation"
 with the Gothic.60 Americans in search of
 a home-grown, national mode of building

 Colonial Americans, according to Mar-
 tha Lamb, had transformed foreign build-
 ing forms to suit "the climate, necessities
 of pioneer life, and social conditions of an
 unformed community." Bragdon acknowl-
 edged the English Georgian origins of the
 colonial but insisted American eighteenth-
 century builders had come "as near as we
 have ever approached to achieving an
 American style of architecture." For
 Embury, eighteenth-century American
 churches represented the flowering of "our
 first national style," no more like English
 architecture than English architecture re-
 sembled Italian. Moreover, the colonial,
 with its modest ornament, was free of the
 "vulgarity and ostentation" of the Euro-
 pean baroque.61

 Not only was colonial architecture

 American, but it also embodied the virtues
 of the great men and women who had cre-
 ated the nation. Thomas Jefferson himself
 as an old man in 1825 advised that sites
 associated with the Revolution, such as the
 house where he lived when writing the

 Declaration of Independence, might well
 be kept "like the relics of saints." When
 Bulfinch's Massachusetts State House was
 threatened with demolition, Boston archi-
 tect Charles A. Cummings preached that
 its destruction "would be a lamentable
 concession to the modern American spirit
 which carries us every year farther away
 from the 'nobler modes of life, with
 sweeter manners, purer laws/ which our
 fathers knew."62

 As A. W. N. Pugin decried the corruption
 of contemporary English society and would
 turn back to the Middle Ages for a model
 social system, so Cummings idealized
 America's colonial past. So did Bragdon
 when he proposed that "architecture . . .
 images at all times a nation's character
 . . . , is the mirror of the national con-
 sciousness. . . . The difference between In-
 dependence Hall . . . and a modern sky-
 scraper is the measure of the difference
 between the men and manners of the Co-
 lonial days, and the men and manners of
 today."63

 Gentility was a quality of colonial archi-
 tecture identified by authors such as Stan-
 ford White's father, Richard Grant White,
 who saw in the houses of "Old New York"

 Dutch colonial house as "never formal . . .

 [or] stately, yet . . . [with] a certain homely
 dignity eminently fitting to the homes of
 the courageous and determined pioneers
 who built them."66

 built in the early 1800s an "air of . . . large
 and elegant domesticity." They were the
 "homes of people of sense, and taste, and
 character," of "gentle breeding." By con-
 trast, the "brownstone fronts" of midcen-
 tury aptly represented the vulgar mob
 housed within.64 The southern plantation
 house was widely believed to express a
 "social elegance" and "aristocratic atmo-
 sphere" comparable to the houses of the
 English landed gentry.65 On the other hand,
 a designer of middle-class houses like Em-
 bury paid tribute to the gambrel-roofed

 In 1940 members of the newly organized
 American Society of Architectural Histo-
 rians determined that their first three

 tours, by car, would focus on colonial
 houses in Massachusetts. The society has
 long been identified with the study of early
 American architecture, agreeing with an
 1882 assessment in the American Architect

 that "we do have an architectural history,
 . . . one in which Americans may take
 pride."67
