 Perspectives on the Seventeenth-Century
 Chesapeake

 AT the close of the seventeenth century, the Chesapeake was a
 mosaic of landscapes, building forms, and subsistence activities,
 layers of cultural patterns imposed by adaptation and innovation.
 Whatever the original intentions of the colonists and their London

 backers who carved out the initial settlement at Jamestown, at the end
 of the century the Chesapeake was unlike anything they might have pre
 viously imagined. Certainly, it did not mirror old England, nor was
 much in Virginia and Maryland like English settlements in New
 England. A dependence on tobacco set the Chesapeake apart. So too did
 the dispersed character of its plantations, separated from each other
 along the region s rivers and broad creeks. Even the character of its hous
 ing was unusual: almost all houses were made of timber and raised by

 earthfast construction, a method found elsewhere but embraced in the

 Chesapeake with a singular tenacity. Its growing dependence on slave
 labor and the patterns of segregated house plans, yards, and labor rou
 tines that emerged at the end of the century made the Chesapeake still
 more distinctive.

 Historians have suggested two main factors to explain the seemingly

 transitory character of the built Chesapeake environment: the demo
 graphic chaos of the region s beginnings as well as the continued insta
 bility that troubled it until the second half of the century and the failure
 to create a diversified economy. Edmund S. Morgan argued three
 decades ago, as did Cary Carson and his collaborators in the early 1980s,
 that Jamestown's boomtown character and the later dominance in the
 region of what has been styled "impermanent architecture" bespoke shal
 low attachments to the place and modest investments in its future.1
 More substantial houses appeared only at the end of the century with
 economic diversification, in particular the rising importance of wheat
 production. These explanations for the seventeenth-century Chesapeake's
 architectural impermanence, compelling as they are, fail to consider
 other dynamic cultural forces.

 Nearly a century of invention, learning, and adaptation resulted in a
 tobacco economy, dispersed settlement, impermanent architectural tech
 nology, growing dependence on slave labor, and increasing social and
 racial differentiation and segregation. The archaeological record can
 serve as a primary source of evidence about the emergence of these
 Chesapeake adaptations. It can also further understanding of the causal
 dynamics that were responsible for them. This article charts change in
 architectural technology, architectural ornament, and the spatial
 arrangement of farmhouses and farmsteads, taking advantage of evidence
 unearthed during the past thirty years. It builds on and revises earlier
 work on material life in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake, which
 emphasized demographic disaster, boomtown mentalities, and the persis
 tence of tobacco monoculture as keys to architectural impermanence. It
 also considers wider categories of evidence. Inferences made from these
 architectural data can be evaluated with independent evidence from doc
 uments and archaeology. Faunal data from the analysis of the remains of
 wild and domestic animals that the colonists consumed reveal important
 trends in diet. Variation in the spatial distribution of different kinds of
 clay tobacco pipes within sites and among them offers clues to the social
 standing and aspirations of the individuals who smoked them.

 ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ARCHITECTURAL PERSPECTIVES 453

 Architectural evidence, archaeological artifacts, and the documentary
 record combine to allow an analysis that focuses on three broad themes:
 shelter, subsistence, and status.

 The years from the initial landing at Jamestown to about 1720 can
 be considered the Chesapeake's long seventeenth century. The year 1607
 marks the beginning of what would become a permanent English settle
 ment in the region, and the expansion of colonial settlements in
 Virginia's southside as well as the taking up of lands farther inland along
 the upper reaches of the Chesapeake Bay in the north signals the end of
 the period.2 During this period English and African settlement encom
 passed the entire coastal plain, displacing the region's native peoples
 (Figure I). By the middle decades of the seventeenth century, a distinc
 tive Chesapeake material culture emerged out of a complex interplay of
 forces. With the transition from a labor force dominated by indentured
 servants to one composed of enslaved Africans and their descendents,
 this regional distinctiveness increased during ensuing decades.

 Recent archaeological and architectural research, as well as the
 400th anniversary of the settlement at Jamestown, prompts a reconsider
 ation of the path the Chesapeake colonies followed toward regional dis
 tinctiveness. This treatment of material evidence departs significantly
 from previous studies in two ways. First, it is quantitative rather than
 anecdotal. When Carson and his collaborators embarked on their study
 of Chesapeake architecture, modern archaeology of the region was still
 young and the data from a little more than two dozen sites supported
 their conclusions. The quarter century since their pathbreaking study
 has seen a tenfold increase in the number of sites that have been identi

 fied and excavated. A quantitative approach makes it possible for the
 first time to accurately date significant shifts in the cultural repertoires
 of Chesapeake colonists and link them in convincing and testable ways
 to the unique ecological, economic, and social conditions to which they
 were a response.

 Second, this analysis is based on the concept that artifacts are histor
 ical evidence. Human activities, from building houses to setting tables at
 mealtime, express strategies integral to the processes individuals and
 groups use to adapt in ways that further their interests in the world and
 respond to the historical circumstances they encounter. This under
 standing implies that the link between artifacts and their historical
 meaning is not primarily symbolic but rather causal. Decision making in
 the seventeenth-century Chesapeake sometimes involved trial-and-error

 2 The shapes and forms of the classically inspired architectural ornaments that
 became increasingly visible after 1720 constitute another marker for the end of Virginia's
 long seventeenth century.

 learning, such as when people tried new solutions to new problems or
 attempted to improve on novel and not-so-novel solutions they learned
 from others. Evaluation and selective retention occurred continuously
 and repeatedly. From a range of strategies, colonists adopted the ones
 that delivered more favorable outcomes. Iterated during weeks, months,
 years, or even generations, such decision making resulted in increased
 frequency of variant strategies; the artifacts linked to these winning
 strategies benefited their users.3

 The role that artifacts played thus suggests that their historical

 meaning can be extracted from analysis of variations in their shapes,
 forms, and uses in daily interactions with natural and social environ
 ments. Consider an unusual iron breastplate excavated from James Fort
 (see Plate II). The breastplate had been reworked by a Jamestown
 colonist who welded a metal flange to the front at the right armhole. In
 late-sixteenth-century Europe, these breastplates were worn by pikemen
 who defended musketeers from cavalry charges. Pikemen wore armor
 and musketeers did not, since only pikemen encountered sword-bearing
 cavalry. In Virginia there was no attacking cavalry and thus no need for
 pikemen. But a breastplate-wearing musketeer would have an obvious
 advantage against natives armed with bows and arrows. Hence the
 breastplate was modified: the flange is at just the place required to
 steady the butt of a musket raised to firing position. Three such breast
 plates, all dating to the early seventeenth century, have been excavated at
 sites along the James River. Indian access to firearms later in the century
 made even modified breastplates obsolete. One by one colonists pitched
 them into wells or trash pits or, as was the case with another Jamestown
 example, pounded them inexpertly into buckets. These discarded breast
 plates reveal that colonists tinkered with the material limitations of an
 Old World strategy for a time but discarded any technology that proved
 ineffective.

 Though a useful example, the altered breastplate is potentially mis
 leading because it is a good trick, an obvious solution to an obvious
 problem. Not all solutions are so clear-cut, nor are all problems. Two
 analytic models?future discounting and signaling theory?can pull
 together the disparate categories of evidence that archaeological excava
 tions have produced. Future discounting offers an insight into the
 process whereby people discount the value of future benefits in ways
 that can profoundly affect the strategic choices they make to acquire and
 expend resources in the present.4 Models of future discounting help to
 clarify the choices that colonists made about investments in earthfast
 architectural technologies. The early dominance of buildings in the
 Chesapeake that consisted of mud-encased light framing demonstrates
 uncertainty about the future and highlights immediate investments in
 land, labor, and tobacco production. The later dominance of earthfast
 structures raised on heavily framed principal posts covered with riven

 clapboards shows declining levels of future uncertainty and payoffs to
 reinvestment in production. Future discounting models illuminate a
 parallel set of choices colonists made about the use of wild or domestic
 mammals and patterns of investment in pigs versus cows.

 Another analytic model is signaling theory, which is a way to under

 stand conspicuous consumption and symbolic capital.5 This model sug
 gests that signals must be undeniably costly to be effective. Building in
 brick was costly in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake; hence, it was a
 powerful and efficacious signal. The amount of wealth that people are
 willing to expend on signals is a function of the level of the quality they
 reflect and the payoffs these signals are calculated to achieve. Payoffs can
 vary widely according to levels of political competition, audience size,
 and prior familiarity of audience members with signalers. Signaling
 models are critical to understanding not only the historically docu
 mented pattern of increasing use of brick but also the concentration of
 brick buildings in and around Jamestown, where political competition
 among elites was most intense and interaction among strangers most fre
 quent. In addition signaling theory offers a cross-culturally valid frame
 work with which to analyze the complex historical dynamics that
 Atlantic historians refer to as the consumer revolution. Signaling helps
 explain two trends in seventeenth-century architecture. One is the
 increased importance of architectural decorative details, initially in the
 exuberant artisan-mannerist fashion and later in a more restrained classi

 cal form. The second is the emergence of novel house plans, including
 new and larger rooms designed specifically for entertaining and room
 arrangements that yielded symmetrical facades.

 The threads of human activities?building houses, devising floor
 plans, furnishing rooms, dressing people, arranging landscapes, defining
 labor relations, and establishing foodways?follow their own evolution
 ary paths. Each activity can be studied independently to find when sig
 nificant change occurs. And where such changes converge in more than
 one thread, patterns lead to discoveries of significant shifts in shared cul
 tural assumptions.

 The modern archaeology of the Chesapeake began in the 1970s, when
 archaeologists and historians fully recognized the signatures of
 ephemeral buildings that populated the landscape of the seventeenth
 century Chesapeake. By 1982 sufficient archaeological data about the
 region's earliest structures had been gathered to support the essay by

 Cary Carson and his collaborators. The archaeological study of the
 seventeenth-century Chesapeake continued at a brisk pace with research
 proceeding on two courses. Archaeological analyses significantly
 extended knowledge of the shape and substance of the material sur
 roundings of everyday life in the seventeenth century and also pursued
 the idea that a distinctive regional architecture emerged in the
 Chesapeake during that time.6

 Carson and his colleagues hypothesized that it was not until late in

 the seventeenth century that a regional building practice coalesced. They
 argued that earthfast construction must have been a familiar English
 practice well known to these early settlers. Subsequent research has rec
 ognized this technology at other British sites, reinforcing the idea that
 there was prior knowledge of it. Recent excavations of seventeenth
 century sites in Maine dating to as early as the 1620s, for example, reveal
 post-in-the-ground structural footprints.7

 As data from numerous excavations of seventeenth-century sites
 across the region have accumulated, it has become clear that Carson and
 his collaborators based their analysis on structures that varied widely in
 building methods and plan types. Furthermore the earliest of the sites
 they considered dated to 1619 and the 1620s, years when particular plan
 tations chartered by the Virginia Company established nucleated settle
 ments along the James River. In 1994 renewed archaeological excavations
 at Jamestown overturned the long-accepted notion that the site of the
 fort built there in the early summer of 1607 had eroded into the James
 River. Archaeologist William M. Kelso discovered that much of early
 Jamestown was intact, sealed beneath layers of soil first plowed in the
 eighteenth century, piled higher by the construction of a Confederate
 artillery battery during the Civil War, and protected by the Association
 for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities since its acquisition of the
 site in 1893.8 Evidence of the fort and buildings the colonists pieced

 together during Jamestown's frail beginnings lay inches beneath the
 modern ground surface. After more than a dozen years of digging, the
 ongoing archaeological effort at the site of James Fort has traced the
 outline of the palisaded, triangular enclosure and explored much of its
 interior (see Plate IV).

 Undertaken in anticipation of the 400th anniversary of Virginias
 English founding, these excavations gained wide popular attention for
 the archaeological study of early Virginia. Archaeological data gathered
 during the last quarter century make it possible to compare evidence
 from the newly excavated fort and the structures built inside it for the
 colony's first months and years with data from many more sites, a
 broader date range, and a wider geographic scope than had been ana
 lyzed in the early 1980s. The work done at Jamestown and at scores of
 other sites throughout the region by a large coterie of archaeologists dur
 ing the past twenty-five years suggests that an assessment of previous
 efforts to describe and explain the architecture of the seventeenth
 century Chesapeake is overdue (Figure II). This new evidence clearly
 narrates the evolution of architecture and material culture in the early
 Chesapeake with its many threads of false beginnings and dead ends.

 It is now possible to put the scope of the architectural forms and
 practices that appeared in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake into a
 broad cultural context. The sequences of adaptation and innovation that
 began in 1607 suggest that by the 1640s colonists understood they had
 created something that responded to their environment and the exigen
 cies of settlement. They borrowed from a number of English building
 traditions to design something that, if not completely new in its many
 component parts, was indeed distinctive in its sum.9

 Architectural Technology in the Chesapeake

 The Chesapeake's path to distinctive architecture began at
 Jamestown. James Fort, and nearly everything built, used, or consumed
 within it, reveals much about the cycle of application and trial of Old
 World strategies, of frequent disappointment, and of occasional success.

 Harrington, directed work in the so-called New Towne, a suburb that spread away from
 James Fort in the 1620s and that eventually supplanted it. See Cotter, Archeological
 Excavations at Jamestown Colonial National Historical Park and Jamestown National
 Historic Site Virginia (Washington, D.C., 1958).

 drawn from more than three hundred published and unpublished reports of archaeologi
 cal projects during the last three decades. The database will eventually be available to
 researchers online through the College of William and Mary and will be expanded and
 updated over time.

 William Strachey's firsthand account of the fort suggested to several gen
 erations of historians that the palisaded enclosure was poorly planned
 and clumsily executed. Some contemporary detractors and historians
 extended that judgment to a condemnation of the entire Virginia enter
 prise. The archaeology of James Fort has revealed a flattened triangle
 that enclosed more than one and one-half acres within a high wall of
 palisades made from upright trunks of small trees five inches to one foot
 in diameter and set in a flat-bottomed trench two feet deep. At each of
 the three corners of the palisades were circular bastions, or raised plat
 forms for artillery and for enfilading musket fire along the fort's side
 walls. James Fort was more sophisticated and militarily credible than
 previously supposed. Defensive ditches six feet wide and four feet deep
 paralleled the palisade at the southeast and southwest corner bastions
 where two squared bulwarks presented additional obstacles. As many as
 three demilunes (triangular enclosures) may have radiated from each of
 the corner bastions, additional formidable obstacles for attackers.
 Designed and built by experienced military men who had served in
 Ireland and fought the Spanish in the Low Countries, James Fort would
 not have looked out of place on an English military outpost elsewhere.10
 Archaeological evidence indicates that the men at James Fort were well
 versed in military architecture and had a clear defense plan in mind, which
 was based on Old World tactics. The evidence, however, also suggests that
 these traditional outworks?ditches, berms, demilunes, and other obstacles
 designed for European foes?were abandoned when it became obvious
 they were of little defensive value against the new Powhatan adversary.
 Later fortified settlements followed Jamestown's example. Martin's
 Hundred, Flowerdew Hundred, and Jordan's Journey were all palisaded,
 but the fortifications at these places did not include the ditches, berms, or
 demilunes for defense against cavalry or massed infantry assaults.11 The
 Powhatan had no horses and did not attack in mass formation; thus, the

 men who designed late Virginia Company-era settlements discarded
 demilunes in favor of curtain walls of upright palisades.

 Archaeologists discovered that James Fort was enlarged to the east
 soon after Strachey described it. When completed the large rectangular
 enclosure tripled the fortified area and gave the settlement a pentagonal
 footprint. Perhaps constructed after John Smith became president of the
 colony in September 1608, this addition was not ditched, a tacit

 tions, see James Deetz, Flowerdew Hundred: The Archaeology of a Virginia Plantation,

 acknowledgment that this feature had already dropped from the vocabu
 lary of fortification on the Virginia frontier.

 As with the adaptation and innovation found at James Fort,
 colonists approached the building process in a similar manner. The
 peculiar social, economic, and environmental conditions of the New
 World led them to modify traditional framing methods. Of the myriad
 ways Englishmen built, two structural systems stood out as useful models
 in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake: slight framing and box framing.12

 Structures built with slight framing had lightweight utilitarian
 frames that were encased in clay. Cheap to produce and easy to repair, a
 slight-frame building required little time for the preparation of materials
 and served well as a covering to protect inhabitants from the elements.
 Archaeologists discovered that the first semipermanent buildings erected
 at James Fort used this type of construction, which continued to be a
 common choice in the Chesapeake through the first half of the century.
 A large rectangular building, Structure 165, anchored the southeast cor
 ner of the fort and may represent rebuilding after a fire ravaged
 Jamestown in January 1608 (Figure III). Like most of the earliest build
 ings, it was earthfast, meaning that the posts forming the sidewalls of
 the building were set into holes dug into the subsoil to hold the struc
 ture erect, which eliminated the need for masonry foundations. Walls
 were fashioned out of clay, packed around crudely aligned and irregu
 larly spaced posts.13 Its roof was likely covered with a thatch of reeds.

 Excavations also revealed two additional early buildings (Structures
 160 and 166) of similar size and earthfast construction within the trian

 gular fort (See Plate I). Strachey described their placement: "To every
 side, a proportioned distance from the palisade, is a settled street of

 12 Carson et al., "New World, Real World." Architectural historian Eric Mercer
 coined the term slight framing. See Mercer, English Vernacular Houses: A Study of
 Traditional Farmhouses and Cottages (London, 1975), 125.

 13 New scholarship also suggests that clay-wall and earthfast construction was more
 prevalent among cottages in seventeenth-century England than historians had formerly
 recognized. On the prevalence of flimsy construction practices, see Robert Machin, "The
 Lost Cottages of England: An Essay on Impermanent Building in Post-Medieval
 England," paper presented at the Winter Conference, Vernacular Architecture Group,

 houses that runs along, so as each line of the angle hath his street."14
 Both buildings were about seventeen feet wide and both had a cellar at
 one end. Each probably consisted of three to four rooms and, like the
 long linear buildings that continued to dominate the interior of James
 Fort and were used sporadically at other early company-era settlements,
 must have been akin to barracks, housing all domestic and industrial
 activities from sleeping and eating to alchemy and metallurgy.

 Based on what has been recovered so far, buildings within the fort

 largely consisted of these long barracks and multifunctional structures. The
 clay-walled rectangular structures at Jamestown stood for less than a decade
 and, even as they sagged and fell apart, colonists employed an alternative
 technology when they built two long row houses, each a series of connected
 rooms, and aligned them along the fort's western wall line. Unlike the fort's
 first buildings, these houses were set on wide masonry foundations of ballast
 stone and river rocks lightly bonded with clay. They demonstrate that a
 variety of forms were tested from an early date. Allegiance to slight framing,
 as measured by the archaeological impression of abandoned buildings,
 dwindled as the colony's purpose evolved from trading to agriculture and as
 forts yielded to farms in the postcompany period.

 The functions and layout of the James Fort buildings may not have
 translated well to the postcompany era, but the post-in-the-ground tech
 nology remained popular with later planters who sought efficient ways to
 build houses. As seasoned colonists and waves of new immigrants experi
 mented with various building strategies, the structural trait that remained
 most constant through the century was earthfast construction. From the
 evidence of more than 450 Chesapeake buildings dating from the first
 century of settlement, nearly 60 percent were earthfast (Table I).

 As the century progressed, colonists tried a variety of framing and

 walling solutions: some traditional methods brought from home, some
 modifications that tweaked English forms to better fit the Chesapeake
 landscape, and some largely new inventions. At the 1630s Kirbye site, for
 instance, thick clay walls were used in conjunction with extremely
 superficial framing to enclose a building with a heavy internal frame

 Thomas Gates, Knight," in A Voyage to Virginia in 1609, ed. Louis B. Wright
 (Charlottesville, Va., 1964), 79 (quotation). Surviving firsthand accounts give a sense of
 the appearance of these first structures. John Smith reported that the buildings con
 structed after the 1608 fire were raised with mud walls packed around forked poles. Their
 roofs were covered with a thatch of reeds set in a bedding of earth. See Smith, The
 Complete Works of Captain John Smith (1580-1?31) in Three Volumes, ed. Philip L.
 Barbour (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1986), 3: 295. Archaeology within the fort confirms
 Smith's descriptions of just how ephemeral the construction material was and how lit
 tle attention was paid to the buildings' alignment. Clay fragments found slumped in
 their ruins testify to their fragility.

 used to relieve most of the roof's load from the outer clay walls (Figure
 IV). Though not a cruck building, the association of angled framing
 members and superficial wall material is certainly reminiscent of this
 well-known English form.15

 Plan of the Kirbye House, York County, Virginia, ca. 1645.

 The range of variation and experimentation has been revealed by
 earthfast houses with sunken floors, tobacco barns and servants' quarters
 consisting simply of A-frame roofs sitting on the ground, puncheon
 buildings (a type of earthfast construction made up of closely set,
 upright posts either driven into the ground or set into shallow holes or
 trenches), and the occasional frame house with continuous sills resting
 on a foundation. By midcentury, however, colonists had developed an
 entirely new approach to construction.

 The building technology that eventually emerged as the common
 solution to regional conditions looked unlike anything in contemporary
 England. Its lineage, however, was related to the mud-clad, lightly struc
 tured dwellings found in early Virginia and to more substantially framed
 buildings common in medieval and postmedieval England. In addition
 to the slight framing associated with mud-walled construction, colonists

 of Britain from the early twelfth century through the late seventeenth century. Willie

 has been imagined for Cheddar Palace. See Philip Rahtz, The Saxon and Medieval Palaces

 drew on a more substantial timber-frame method called box framing.
 The wall frame of these structures consisted of sills, posts, plates, and tie
 beams over which was raised a structurally integrated roof. With its
 complicated mortise-and-tenon joinery, the intricacy of this structural
 system required a carpenter's skills to plan and assemble. The easy avail
 ability of wood made a variant of box framing an obvious solution for
 tidewater planters.16

 If timber framing was a natural choice for a region rich in forests, the
 scarcity of skilled labor delayed the adoption of box framing because it
 required neatly prepared timbers and intricate joints, both expensive
 propositions. Colonists married the simplicity and low cost of slight fram
 ing with the robustness of the box frame. This combination condensed
 timber framing to its most basic requirements, creating a stout structure
 similar to box framing and laid out with a degree of regularity to easily
 and neatly receive siding such as clapboards. The joinery was minimized
 and reduced to simple laps with posts sunk in the ground in the manner
 of slight framing. This form of building became so ubiquitous by the
 1640s that colonists coined "Virginia house" to reflect the extensive
 refashioning of English carpentry practices into something now recogniz
 able as distinct and belonging to the New World.17 The adoption of this
 terminology coincides with the increased appearance of earthfast houses
 with neatly aligned posts (Figures V?VI). Though the regularity of posts
 on archaeological sites does not ensure that a building was covered with
 clapboards, unaligned posts preclude their use. Whereas only 30 percent
 of the surveyed buildings dating to the first half of the seventeenth cen
 tury were framed in a regular fashion, 68 percent had regular framing by
 the second half of the century, evidence of the growing predisposition of
 colonists to use clapboard covering.

 Medieval Villages: Studies, ed. Maurice Beresford and Hurst (London, 1971), 76-144. For
 framing technology, see Mercer, English Vernacular Houses, 125?26; Richard Harris,
 Discovering Timber-Framed Buildings (Princes Risborough, Eng., 1978), 23-24; Dell
 Upton, "Early Vernacular Architecture in Southeastern Virginia" (Ph.D. diss., Brown
 University, 1979), 1: 58-59. Upton notes the evolution of common seventeenth-century
 framing from earlier close-studded models. While other ornamental framing styles often
 relied on middle rails to break the length of studs (in part because long timbers were
 increasingly difficult to obtain), conventional close studding did not. Common
 seventeenth-century framing of the type that inspired Chesapeake carpentry omitted hori
 zontal rails as principal framing members.

 17 In 1647 the Virginia General Assembly enacted a bill stipulating "that such houses
 provided for that purpose shall be accompted sufficient prisons as are built according to
 the forme of Virginia houses, from which noe escape can be made without breaking or
 forcing some part of the prison house" (William Waller Hening, ed., The Statutes at
 Large: Being a Collection of All Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in
 the Year 1619 [New York, 1819], 1: 340).

 Archaeology.

 The Virginia house was a purely technological solution and not a
 plan type except that it limited house widths to twenty feet, the distance
 a frame could span without internal support. It was an ingenious inte
 gration of framing and skinning that could be used for virtually any
 type of building, whether a courthouse, dwelling, or barn. Its major
 components included an earthfast frame and riven clapboards.

 Clay, which was susceptible to the wet, humid, subtropical climate

 of the Chesapeake, was abandoned as the principal wall covering and
 limited to chimneys and floors or occasionally packed in eaves or in wall
 cavities between the studs to weatherproof a structure. From midcentury
 onward colonists increasingly built with a more substantial and orderly
 framework, albeit still with earthfast posts. As carpentry in the
 Chesapeake became distinctive, its use also modestly increased in com
 plexity, one of the signals that, with a rise in investments of time, labor,
 and expense in housing, architecture was discounted less.

 Riven clapboard carpentry of the Virginia house became the domi

 nant way of building during the second half of the seventeenth century,
 reflecting a coalescing view shared by planters of all social ranks about
 how a house in the Chesapeake should be built. The frame of the new
 Virginia house was assembled using timber that was either hewn to
 shape or split from abundant straight oak and chestnut trees. This tech
 nique saved time and labor costs. The simplified lap joinery used to
 assemble the frame also required less precisely prepared surfaces than
 those inherent in the more complicated joinery of English box frames.
 Because the frame was earthfast and the seating of posts in the ground
 gave the structure rigidity, colonists did not need to use braces. Once
 end-chimney plans became the preferred arrangement for houses, side

 wall assembly emerged as the ideal way to raise such a frame. The bene
 fits of earthfast, sidewall assembly were twofold: it streamlined joinery at
 the eaves and made precise alignment of vertical framing members easier
 to achieve. Such regularity was necessary for the application of wooden
 siding.18

 Like clay for walls, thatch for roofs had run its course by midcen
 tury. The lightness of clapboard roofs allowed the use of simplified
 trusses with fewer members of smaller-dimensioned stock than were typ
 ical of English carpentry. By lapping clapboards end to end and one row
 on top of another, builders added rigidity to the roof and eliminated the
 need for lateral bracing. The elaborate joinery necessary to connect the
 roof to the wall frame was eliminated altogether by the ingenious use of
 a square timber called a false plate. This board was pinned to the top of
 joist ends, and the rafter feet were simply notched over and nailed to it.
 The false plate dramatically minimized the amount of time required to
 connect the roof to the lower walls, and the abundance of wood made

 the cost of materials to cover it negligible.19

 Early company-period sites were dominated by slight-framed, mud

 walled buildings. The connection between poor longevity expectations
 and the ease with which these buildings could be erected reflects the
 uncertainty settlers felt about life in the new settlement. Uncertainty
 moved with the frontier, expanding north from Saint Marys City.
 Richard Chaney's house on the South River, constructed in the late 1650s,
 and the early houses of Providence on the Severn River, settled by dissi
 dents from southeastern Virginia, continued the slight frame, irregularly
 aligned posts, and mud-covered conventions of the earlier era.

 By the third quarter of the seventeenth century, a degree of stability

 had been achieved and the Virginia house, in relative terms, was more

 18 Periodic use of older, outdated modes and the regular introduction of new ideas

 from abroad continued to give variety to the Chesapeake landscape. Bent construction,
 common in the first half of the century, was the ideal framing mode for center chimney
 plans because bay spacing could be easily adjusted to account for varying room sizes and
 chimney bays. With end-chimney plans, bays became less important. For an overview of
 the early framing system in Virginia and Maryland, see Willie Graham, "Preindustrial
 Framing in the Chesapeake," in Constructing Image, Identity, and Place, ed. Alison K.
 Hoagland and Kenneth A. Breisch (Knoxville, Tenn., 2003), 179-96. Earthfast bent
 frame structures often show a poor alignment of posts along the length of the building,
 making it difficult to nail wood siding to it. Sidewall structures have the advantage of a
 continuous plate to help keep the posts in alignment.

 19 Slate, stone, and tiles were rarely used in the Chesapeake countryside and never as

 part of the Virginia house system. Besides being labor intensive to produce locally and
 expensive to purchase from abroad, they also required stouter roof frames than those fash
 ioned for a clapboard covering. For a discussion of the origins of the false plate, see Cary
 Carson, "The 'Virginia House' in Maryland," Maryland Historical Magazine 69, no. 2
 (1974): 185-96.

 stoutly built, was better covered, and had a longer life expectancy than
 its predecessors. Yet when colonists desired larger or more sophisticated
 structures, they had to modify the Virginia house form. To construct
 houses that were two rooms deep, builders required roof types of greater
 spans than the simplified common rafter roof the Virginia house
 afforded. Adaptation and innovation led to structures with continuous
 sills set on masonry foundations with the principal timbers sawn to
 shape and covered with a more regular treatment of sawn and beaded
 siding. Referred to as English framing, the structure of the new polite
 house was more durable and complex than its seventeenth-century
 Virginia house counterpart and represented a further decline in the
 inclination to discount investments in architecture.20

 Diet

 If the future discounting model accurately explains changes in archi

 tectural technology during the seventeenth century, it should be useful in
 understanding change in other domains as well. Analysis of faunal remains
 from contemporary Chesapeake sites reveals that what seventeenth
 century Virginians chose to eat echoed the thinking behind their archi
 tectural decisions. During the past several decades, zooarchaeologists
 studying excavated faunal samples have documented dramatic changes
 through the first century of settlement in planters' meat diet and, at the
 close of the seventeenth century, meat in the diet of their servants and
 slaves. The model of future discounting also elucidates the choice to rely
 more on the delayed returns offered by animal husbandry than on the
 immediate returns from hunting and fishing.21 Investing years of effort

 to care for and feed a cow until it reaches maturity means taking the risk
 that someone else might kill and consume the cow or that the cow's
 owner or his or her heirs might die or move before the cow matures.
 Some individuals would prefer not to invest in a cow at all and hunt for
 meat instead. Greater reliance on wild resources, then, implies higher dis
 count rates and greater uncertainty about the future. Data from excavated
 faunal samples show that reliance on wild species decreased dramatically
 during the seventeenth century (Figure VII). A regression-based estimate
 of the overall trend, with its 95 percent confidence limits, demonstrates
 that wild mammal usage declined significantly up to the third quarter
 of the seventeenth century, which implies that colonists were increas
 ingly willing to forgo the immediate returns from hunting in favor of
 delayed returns from husbandry during the first half of the century.

 Future discounting is also relevant to understanding changes in the

 relative abundance of cows and pigs and the place given them in the
 seventeenth-century diet. When the future is uncertain and current
 investments are likely to have higher long-term payoffs, domesticated
 animals with higher reproductive rates will be favored over those with
 lower ones. Reproductive rates vary inversely with body size. Other fac
 tors being equal, higher discount rates should cause farmers to prefer
 pigs to cows. The Chesapeake pattern of change?the frequency of pig
 bones relative to pig and cow bones combined?matches the pattern for
 wild species relative to domestic mammals (Figure VIII).

 A regression-based estimate of the overall trend, again with its 95
 percent confidence limits, demonstrates that the number of pig remains
 declined significantly into the third quarter of the century. The agree
 ment between the trends for wild mammal and pig usages offers strong
 support for the notion that future discounting declined until about 1660
 (see Figures VII?VIII). After 1680 pig bone frequencies again increase
 and by 1720 they average about 50 percent of the total. Significantly, the
 timing of the increase coincides with the shift from indentured to slave
 labor. At the Drummond site near Jamestown, two assemblages?one
 dominated by the remains of pigs and wild mammals and the other by
 cow bones?have been interpreted as representing two distinct kinds of

 increase in pig remains has important implications for changes in how
 servants and slaves were fed as the seventeenth century drew to a close.

 Wild resources were a critical component of the meat diet in the
 early seventeenth century. Faunal assemblages also document the choices
 colonists made about which wild species to pursue. A prey-choice model
 helps explain the shifting factors that informed those choices. The
 model suggests that in identifying suitable wild prey, hunters should
 first rank species in terms of the amount of meat gained by consuming
 them relative to the time and effort required to pursue, capture, and
 process the animals. In general larger-bodied animals such as deer

 supply more meat than smaller-bodied ones such as squirrels. Hence the
 prey-choice model would expect hunters to target larger-bodied animals
 to the exclusion of smaller-bodied ones, assuming a bounty of large ani
 mals. It would be more efficient to hunt deer than squirrels if deer are
 reasonably abundant.

 In theory overhunting larger animals such as deer decreases their
 abundance and should force hunters to target low-ranked animals such
 as squirrels. Inclusion of these smaller animals in the diet is not a func
 tion of their abundance but of the shrinking availability of larger ones.
 Faunal assemblages dominated by smaller-bodied species are thus signs
 of low foraging efficiency and subsistence stress. The model predicts
 that deer remains would dominate in early assemblages and then decline

 in frequency relative to smaller species such as squirrels. In fact the
 opposite occurred at Jamestown.23 Assemblages from the fort period are
 dominated by smaller-bodied species, whereas the reverse is true of later
 assemblages, implying that perhaps deer became more abundant after
 1620, which seems unlikely. A more likely explanation is that fear of
 Indian attack constrained the ability of fort-era hunters to roam the
 local woodlands in search of deer, forcing greater reliance on lower
 ranked animals such as squirrels. Early Jamestown colonists had to work
 harder for less. When constraints on their movement declined in the

 1620s, they hunted more deer.

 Consumption of fish through the century varied slightly from the
 pattern of wild game. Adult sturgeon, which were available in the
 Chesapeake Bay from March to June, weighed around one hundred
 pounds, five to ten times the size of other accessible species during the
 seventeenth century. Sturgeon constitute more than 70 percent of all
 fish remains in fort-era assemblages. Apparently, Indian-imposed con
 straints that limited the movement of fort-era foragers only applied on
 dry land.24 Because sturgeon appear in significant numbers in assem
 blages after 1620, their concentration in the James River during spawn
 ing runs seems to have made the considerable effort required to harvest
 these large fish worthwhile even to colonists now raising domestic ani
 mals. By 1640, however, the frequency of sturgeon bones approaches
 zero, supplanted by smaller-bodied species.

 The fort-era assemblages reveal remarkably high frequencies of pig
 relative to cow, sturgeon relative to other fish, and small wild mammals
 relative to deer. They also contain higher frequencies of turtles and wild
 birds relative to domestic mammals than any other assemblages from the
 Chesapeake region. High frequencies of wild species of all sorts and
 smaller wild mammals relative to larger ones are consistent with high
 levels of uncertainty and heavy future discounting. They are also com
 patible with the hypothesis that ideas the colonists brought with them
 about obtaining meat were radically at odds with Chesapeake reality.

 23 Joanne Bowen and Susan Trevarthen Andrews, "The Starving Time at

 Jamestown: Faunal Analysis of Pit i, Pit 3, the Bulwark Ditch, Ditch 6, Ditch 7, and
 Midden 1," report submitted to APVA Jamestown Rediscovery, 2000.

 24 Some archaeologists have interpreted the Jamestown assemblages as the unique

 product of the starving time, a notion that construes the assemblages as the result of a
 Pompeii-like event. Cataclysms of that sort, however, are exceedingly rare. Almost all
 archaeological assemblages are the result of long periods of accumulation reckoned in
 terms of decades. Thus it is more likely that the assemblages are typical, suggesting that
 low foraging efficiency and subsistence stress were enduring characteristics of the colony
 during the first decades of settlement. This idea also fits well with the recent dendrocli
 matological discovery that the decade following 1607 witnessed one of the region's worst
 droughts of the previous millennium.

 The astonishingly low frequencies of domestic mammals early on at
 Jamestown may point to the delusion of being able to trade with locals
 for meat. Such a strategy might have worked in other joint-stock com
 pany outposts but it did not at Jamestown.

 If the interpretation of these trends is correct, there are significant

 implications for understanding change in architectural technology. The
 synchrony of substantially framed, post-in-the-ground technologies,
 which had almost entirely replaced slight-framed, clay-wall construction
 by the middle of the century, with declines in the remains of wild mam
 mals and pigs lends independent support to the idea that the technolog
 ical shift was also driven by decreases in uncertainty about the future.
 Discount rates, as reflected in fauna and framing, had stabilized by 1660,
 yet there is an increase in the frequency of brick building at roughly the
 same time. The emergence of brick construction was likely linked to a
 different set of causal dynamics. Increases in the frequency and scale of
 brick building in the second half of the seventeenth century can be
 traced to the efficacy of brick as a signal of wealth in the context of eco
 nomic and political competition among local and English elites.

 The Prestige of Brick

 As the seventeenth century progressed, costly signaling expanded,

 especially in the last quarter of the century with increasing wealth,
 continuing immigration and population growth, and changing levels of
 Crown involvement in the region's political affairs. Brick-walled buildings
 were perhaps the ultimate example of costly signaling in the seventeenth
 century Chesapeake. Unhappy with the material progress of Jamestown
 after more than a half century of settlement, royal authorities in London
 endorsed Governor William Berkeley's scheme to turn the capital into
 something more than a straggling collection of wooden alehouses and
 dwellings. Berkeley ushered through the General Assembly in 1662 "An act
 for building a towne" that specified the construction of thirty-two two
 story brick houses in Jamestown financed through a combination of
 county taxes, fines, and incentives for investors. Laid out in formal
 arrangement, the town houses were to emulate the pattern of urban devel
 opment then blossoming in the West End of London. The act stipulated
 that new wooden buildings were prohibited and standing wooden struc
 tures were to be pulled down when they fell into disrepair.25

 Building in brick modestly increased following the 1662 act. In 1665
 Secretary of the Colony Thomas Ludwell reported that through the
 efforts of Berkeley and other officials, Virginians had "begun a town of
 brick and have allreddy built enough to accommodate both the publique

 affairs of the country and to begin a factory for merchants and shall
 increase it as there shall bee occasion for it." In addition to the town

 houses, the colony erected its first purpose-built brick statehouse.
 Archaeology at Jamestown confirms the construction of at least two sets of
 four-unit brick row houses (Structures 115 and 144) that were undoubtedly
 part of this public works program (Figure IX). Documentary evidence
 indicates that several more row houses were built, including eight by the
 governor himself.26

 Created at the behest of provincial officials, the row houses found
 limited acceptance in a society that doggedly resisted urban habitation.
 Many units became taverns; another served briefly as a jail. All burned
 during Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 and some remained in ruins years later.
 All disappeared by the early eighteenth century. Jamestown's boosters
 never succeeded in turning the town into the idealized entrep?t envis
 aged in the 1662 act. By 1671 officials had even relaxed their ban on
 wooden buildings. But for a brief moment in the seventeenth century,
 thanks to royal pressure and Berkeley's keen eye for investment opportu
 nities, brick building had flourished in the capital.

 Masonry construction at Jamestown furnished a visual, structural,
 and symbolic counterpoint to the wooden buildings that dominated the
 Chesapeake landscape in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
 The absence of building stone in most of tidewater Virginia and southern
 Maryland made brick the only alternative to wood as a building material.
 Deposits of clay were plentiful throughout the region, but the skills and
 cost involved in making bricks and tiles limited their use during the first
 century of English settlement. As excavations at Providence, in Anne
 Arundel County, Maryland, and other early- and mid-seventeenth
 century sites indicate, imported brick and tile offered a modest alternative
 to local production. Yellow clinker bricks lined hearths and a checker
 board of yellow- and green-glazed tiles paved floors at Providence, no
 doubt purchased from Dutch ships that plied the Chesapeake. As the
 framers of the 1662 act acknowledged, a shortage of brickmakers and
 bricklayers drove up the cost of their services, placing the use of brick
 even for foundations and chimneys out of the reach of planters who strug
 gled to find the proper balance between investments in agricultural labor
 and house improvements.27

 along the York River enticed colonists to use it to build Grace Church in Yorktown in
 1697. Beyond these modest and limited sources, easily collectible fieldstone did not exist
 east of the fall line in the Chesapeake. A few bands of fieldstone in Maryland enabled
 builders to find enough materials for the construction of a foundation, cellar, or chimney.
 Except for part of northern Maryland and certain areas between the Rappahannock and
 Potomac rivers in Virginia, the area also lacked stone for quarrying. The first quarries did
 not open until the 1730s when a vein of soft but easily workable buff-colored sandstone
 was extracted from Aquia Creek in Stafford Co., Va. On the use of Dutch brick in Anne

 Building with manufactured materials was fraught with logistical
 pitfalls that most planters simply chose to avoid. Others took extraordi
 nary measures to secure those materials. William Byrd I (known as
 William Byrd of Westover) so desired roofing tiles that he went to the

 expense of importing them from England.28 Used to line cellars or the
 backs of hearths, fragments of brick and mortar turn up on seventeenth
 century sites throughout the Chesapeake in sparing amounts, as if they
 were precious resources.

 The 1662 town act was the culmination of two decades of efforts by
 a few individuals to make brick building commonplace in the
 Chesapeake. They generally failed. Though a few early colonists used
 bricks for foundations, cellars, and chimneys, brick-walled buildings
 first appeared in the 1640s and 1650s at only a few sites. The first brick
 houses tended to be the homes of newcomers rather than native-born
 men or indentured servants who had served out their time. These well

 connected immigrants, including Robert Beverley, Richard Kemp, and
 William Sherwood, had the financial wherewithal and the desire to build

 well and conspicuously soon after they arrived. They came from a gener
 ation of English gentry and merchants who had taken the initiative in
 replacing the traditional wooden buildings found in most English towns
 and on country estates with masonry structures and were determined to
 replicate their accustomed circumstances despite the difficulties of build
 ing in a frontier society. Significantly, members of this group did not
 confine their economic pursuits to tobacco production.29 Governor
 Berkeley and this coterie of immigrant provincial officials embarked on
 substantial brick-building projects that asserted their political authority
 and social prestige.

 The first cluster of these brick buildings appeared in the Jamestown
 area. Erected by men who aspired to play a role in the colony's political
 affairs, some of these structures served as semiofficial meeting places for

 Virginia, 1684-1776 (Charlottesville, Va., 1977), 1: in. Arthur Allen of Surry County cov
 ered his roof with English stone slates.

 29 Robert Beverley, Richard Kemp, and William Sherwood are examples of the

 assertive men who historian Bernard Bailyn observes "assumed control of public office
 by virtue not of inherited status but of newly achieved and strenuously maintained eco
 nomic eminence" (Bailyn, "Politics and Social Structure in Virginia," in Seventeenth
 Century America: Essays in Colonial History, ed. James Morton Smith [Chapel Hill,
 N.C., 1959], 90-115 [quotation, 96]). Their rapid rise to dominate Virginia's politics in
 the mid-seventeenth century emanated from a shrewd combination of merchant and
 planter roles. Signaling theory suggests that they benefited from greater investments in
 brick because their social and economic standing owed much to commercial and politi
 cal connections that were not easily discernible. On the rising prestige of brick and
 stone building in seventeenth-century England, see Nicholas Cooper, Houses of the
 Gentry, 1480?1680 (New Haven, Conn., 1999).

 the council and courts. Besides his Jamestown houses, Governor
 Berkeley erected a two-story, E-shaped brick house at Green Spring in
 the 1640s. He then more than doubled its size by adding a wing in the
 early 1660s. Berkeley may have been following the example of Kemp,
 then the secretary of the colony, who was credited by Governor John
 Harvey with erecting the first brick house in Jamestown on land he had
 patented in 1638 and who erected another brick house on a plantation at
 Rich Neck in nearby Middle Plantation early in the 1640s.30

 As in Virginia, provincial officials, chiefly members of the Calvert

 family and their deputies, constructed many of the earliest masonry
 buildings in Maryland. Following his appointment as deputy governor
 in 1638, Thomas Cornwaleys built a brick house in Saint Marys City.
 Charles Calvert, 3d Lord Baltimore, made the brick pile Mattapony in
 Calvert County his primary residence in the early 1670s. Eventually,
 other immigrants recognized that costly building projects offered cachet
 in a society where social rank had not yet solidified. A few merchants
 and even some planters who did not sink all their capital into tobacco
 chose to build in brick. John Page at Middle Plantation (1662), Arthur
 Allen across the James in Surry County (1665), Joseph Bridger in Isle of
 Wight County (1670s), and John Custis II at Arlington on the Eastern
 Shore (1675) were among a handful of powerful newcomers who ignored
 the tribulations of gathering a skilled labor force and expensive building
 materials and erected substantial brick dwellings to enhance their politi
 cal and social positions (Figures X-XI; see Plate III).31 Costly signaling
 had its rewards for Page, Bridger, and Custis, who became members of
 the Governor's Council, and their political attainments were replicated
 at the end of the century by Lewis Burwell of Fairfield and Edmund
 Jennings of Ripon Hall. Though possession of a brick dwelling was not
 a requisite for membership, a fine house offered a boost for newcomers.
 After Allen's son inherited his father's brick house and large tracts of
 land in Surry County, he later became Speaker of the House of
 Burgesses in the 1680s. Obscure men never built brick houses. Yet brick
 houses constituted only a handful when compared with the hundreds of
 wooden buildings documented or excavated throughout the Chesapeake.
 Brick construction was exceptional. The number of brick-walled

 buildings was on the rise in the last quarter of the seventeenth century
 but still constituted about one-quarter of the buildings constructed from
 1607 to 1720. When the buildings from Jamestown, Saint Marys City,
 and later Annapolis and Williamsburg?the areas most intensively stud
 ied archaeologically?are subtracted from the count, the inventory of
 masonry-walled buildings in the Chesapeake dating from the first cen
 tury of settlement is less than 15 percent. If only rural brick dwellings are
 considered, then the percentage is negligible.

 The rarity of brick construction is borne out by the evidence from
 public buildings in the second half of the seventeenth century. In
 Virginia only a few counties and parishes had built brick courthouses

 and churches by the end of the century. Parishioners at Jamestown
 labored long to complete a brick church in the 1640s and were forced to
 rebuild it following its destruction during Bacon's Rebellion. Outside
 the capital brick churches existed in no more than five or six parishes
 that bordered the James or York rivers. When the vestry of Christ
 Church parish in Middlesex County undertook the construction of two
 new brick churches and a frame one from 1711 to 1717, the total cost of

 the undertaking was more than 312,000 pounds of tobacco, or approxi
 mately ?1,800 sterling, which equaled half the total budget for both the
 county court and the parish for the previous decade. Other vestries
 eventually followed the lead of Christ Church and replaced their
 wooden buildings with brick churches, but few did so before the 1730s.32
 In Maryland the record of building in brick was even more meager.
 County magistrates met in alehouses and earthfast timber buildings
 until a few brick courthouses were built early in the first quarter of the
 eighteenth century. In the 1670s a cruciform brick statehouse was built
 at Saint Marys City, and in 1679 Chancellor Philip Calvert erected Saint
 Peter's, the most ambitious brick house in the colony, which also served
 as a public meeting place. Catholics in Saint Marys City erected a large
 cruciform brick chapel in the late 1660s but outside the capital the reli
 gious needs of scattered congregations of Catholics, Quakers, Puritans,
 and Anglicans were barely served. A 1698 survey of places of worship
 listed a few small chapels and meetinghouses on both sides of the
 Chesapeake Bay, described as "plain country buildings" or "clapboard
 houses" built "after the manner of a tobacco house." In other words

 these structures were of the Virginia house tradition that emerged for
 common building. Following the establishment of the Anglican Church
 in the 1690s, a handful of brick churches, including Saint Paul's in Kent
 County, built in 1713, appeared in newly formed parishes in the first
 quarter of the eighteenth century.33

 A generation after Berkeley, another governor, Francis Nicholson,
 tried to reshape the architectural landscape of the Chesapeake by mov
 ing the capitals of both colonies. In the early 1690s, he abandoned Saint
 Marys City for a more central location farther up the Chesapeake Bay at
 Annapolis. A few years later, he shifted the Virginia capital from
 swampy Jamestown Island to a more salubrious location at Middle
 Plantation, where he laid out Williamsburg. Nicholson was an ardent
 Royalist and a firm supporter of the Anglican Church. He did all he
 could to acknowledge these loyalties by strengthening the authority of
 church and state in his town designs and public building programs. In
 Annapolis a brick statehouse, a brick Anglican church (Saint Anne's),
 and a brick grammar school rose at the highest point in the town.34
 Compared with the public buildings soon to go up in the new Virginia
 capital, all were modest affairs.

 A rectangular brick church with curvilinear gables built by Page in

 1683 stood advantageously in the center of Williamsburg. To proclaim
 the Crown's authority over the new Virginia capital, provincial officials
 constructed two prominent and architecturally pretentious buildings: a
 statehouse and a governor's house. Both the capitol and governor's house
 had several features that raised them above the general level of architec
 tural competence practiced in early-eighteenth-century Virginia. With
 its central soaring cupola adorned by royal arms, compass-headed win
 dows, and arcade that linked the two wings of the building, the capitol
 contained architectural details common in contemporary English public
 buildings yet almost unknown in the Chesapeake. County magistrates
 gradually incorporated these features into their courthouse designs.35
 Though Nicholson was recalled to England before he could begin an
 official residence, the Governor's Council undertook the design and
 oversaw the construction of a two-story, double-pile governor's house at
 the terminus of a cross-axial avenue just north of the parish church.
 With its modillion cornice, sash windows, hip roof, and advanced ser
 vice wings that formed a front courtyard, the governor's house became
 the prototype for elite residences throughout the colony.

 Previous research has linked the emergence of architectural perma
 nence in the Chesapeake as indicated by brick foundations and walls to
 economic diversification. When viewed from a cost-signaling perspective,

 ing when the provincial government moved in the 1690s. After the construction of
 the new brick statehouse in Annapolis, Anne Arundel Co. justices were allowed the
 use of a room in the building. See Morris L. Radoff, The County Courthouses and

 the evidence points to a different explanation for the increased fre
 quency of brick construction during the second half of the seventeenth
 century and its spatial concentration in the region's political centers.
 Governors, councilors, and newly arrived immigrants with political and
 economic ties to Britain and the larger Atlantic world benefited from
 extravagant investments in brick. The prestige of brick convinced those
 who were not familiar with the newcomers that they were formidable
 competitors or valuable social allies.

 Metal and Material Goods

 Jamestown's appalling attrition rate during the company period due

 to disease, accident, war, and starvation has led historians to conclude
 that dire futures and spartan furnishings went hand in hand. Data
 emerging from recent excavations suggest that the everyday material
 world at Jamestown was more complicated than that. Excavated artifacts
 make it clear that Jamestown's first colonists were well equipped to pur
 sue a number of industrial ventures, especially the search for metals then
 in short supply in England. At least 16 percent of the men identified as
 artisans who lived on Jamestown Island from May 1607 to October 1608
 were involved in the working of metal. Archaeological evidence reveals
 that the necessary equipment and the waste from the assaying of ores were
 cast off everywhere in the fort but particularly on the east side of the
 enclosure. Crucibles exhibit the residue of tests for gold, silver, zinc, and
 other metals. A ceramic alembic (a specialized vessel used to produce
 chemicals necessary for the detection and refinement of precious metals)
 and other metallurgical equipment suggest that the gold refiners and other
 metalworking artisans who were in Jamestown during the earliest years
 worked from a well-equipped shop. Like all the bright hopes for quick
 profits in Virginia, the search for metals was dashed by high mortality
 rates rather than a paucity of equipment or expertise.36

 Along with these implements, archaeologists have recovered more
 than eight thousand pieces of sheet copper in the excavations at
 Jamestown. Fragments identical in form and chemical composition to
 the Jamestown scraps discovered at two Powhatan villages dating to the
 early seventeenth century confirm the role copper played as currency in
 exchanges between colonists and native peoples when the English first
 arrived. The value of copper collapsed soon thereafter, devalued by its
 abundance. The first colonists at Jamestown intended to use the sheet

 the metal trade at Jamestown, see Carter C. Hudgins, "Articles of Exchange or
 Ingredients of New World Metallurgy? An Examination of the Industrial Origins and

 copper as currency, a plan that failed just as surely as their use of copper
 scraps as flux in assaying ore samples failed to find prized metals.

 Archaeologists' discovery inside James Fort of fragments of a type of
 ceramic pot called Potomac Creek ware also reveals cultural exchange
 between English colonists and Indians. Produced by Native Americans
 in the Virginia coastal plain and characterized by inclusions of ground
 oyster shell, the pots point to the complicated relationship that emerged
 between English colonists and Powhatan's people. Though these pots
 may indicate the coercive relationships that often characterized interac
 tion between the two groups, it is also possible that they reflect a brief
 period of cooperation when Indian corn saved the colony. Nowhere else
 in the Chesapeake have so many Indian artifacts been recovered at an
 English site. Contemporary Indian artifacts are almost altogether absent
 at all other seventeenth-century sites.

 If the gold that rich men in England hoped would make them richer

 proved elusive in Virginia, the men who lived and worked there estab
 lished and maintained the distinctions that defined social boundaries at

 home. A quality youth's latchet-style shoe, for instance, survived in the
 muddy bottom of Well 27, dug outside the fort's western wall, as did a fire
 shovel with brass fittings. Dozens upon dozens of glass bottles and tum
 blers along with ceramic plates, jugs, mugs, bowls, chargers, and costrels
 indicate that even when colonists had nothing to eat, Jamestown's tables
 were well set. Tailoring irons and goffering irons, the latter necessary to
 care for and repair the ruffs and collars of looped semicircles of linen
 that gentlemen preferred, played their roles in maintaining the stiff,
 starched boundary that separated the colony's leaders from its laborers.
 Lost in even greater numbers were more than sixteen hundred aglets,
 small metal cylinders folded on the ends of laces and used to secure
 items of clothing. Also discarded were seventy-six small, circular cloth
 seals, the metal disks affixed to bolts of cloth that proclaimed their
 origin and that taxes had been paid. Many of the more than 1 million
 artifacts excavated thus far at Jamestown reflect the role costly personal
 accoutrements and expensive possessions played as props to social and
 political position within the small social theater of James Fort. They also
 reveal much about the cruel notion of starving in style.37 Simply put,

 dreds of thousands of artifacts excavated at Jamestown, from the simplest and most
 numerous such as shards of bottle glass to the most complete and complex such as a
 pewter tankard with its hinged lid still attached, has focused on identification and conser
 vation. Most of the far more difficult task of completing a description of Jamestown from
 artifactual sources and an explanation of what they reveal about the colony remains
 unfinished.

 though documents may make it clear that Jamestown's first years were
 arduous and there were inadequate provisions for daily survival, archae
 ology has discovered that material goods from England were not in short
 supply.

 Clay tobacco pipes were among the first objects to be deployed as
 costly signals (Figure XII). These displays of conspicuous consumption
 expanded from person and parlor to plantation as the seventeenth cen
 tury progressed. While studying Jamestown pipe assemblages in the
 1950s, archaeologist J. C. Harrington, one of Jamestown's most careful
 excavators, noticed that the bore diameter of white clay pipes imported
 from England declined during the seventeenth century.38 As a result of
 Harrington's discovery, many archaeologists have measured pipestem
 bore diameters to date sites. Because the mechanics of pipe production
 require pipes with longer and thinner stems to have smaller bores, the
 temporal trend in bore diameters Harrington recognized also highlights
 a preference over time for longer, thinner, and more fragile pipes. Given
 the greater encumbrance and higher breakage rates of such pipes, their
 increase in popularity during the century seems puzzling until one
 applies the plausible hypothesis that pipes with longer, thinner stems
 were strategically useful as portable, costly signals of wealth. No single
 class of portable artifacts supplies more systematic, quantifiable informa
 tion on social dynamics of commodity production and consumption in
 the early modern Atlantic and within the Chesapeake.

 Englishmen learned from the Algonquin how to smoke tobacco in
 clay pipes in the late sixteenth century. Initially the practice was exotic
 and expensive, qualities that gave smoking its appeal to elites. The
 Virginia Company tried to cash in on the craze in 1607 by sending
 London pipemaker Robert Cotton to Jamestown to ply his trade. That
 Cotton actually made pipes in Virginia, intended for shipment back to
 European markets, is attested by the recovery at James Fort of kiln furni
 ture, wasters, and completed pipes. In a little more than a decade, it
 became clear that Virginia's economic future lay with the production of
 the drug itself, not the paraphernalia required to ingest it. As Virginia's
 tobacco output increased exponentially, tobacco prices fell, bringing
 smoking within reach of individuals further down the social scale. To
 stay ahead of the crowd, wealthy smokers demanded longer, thinner, and

 more costly pipes with smaller bores and larger bowls to distinguish
 themselves from social inferiors. English pipemakers were happy to
 accommodate larger numbers of more socially diverse customers by
 turning out smaller-bore pipes for the wealthy and larger-bore pipes for
 the rest. This process, iterated over decades, produced the continuous
 decrease in bore diameters that Harrington observed. In addition
 increases in the variance of bore diameters within assemblages as smok
 ing's popularity grew throughout Chesapeake society can be found in
 the pipestem assemblages that Harrington and colleagues excavated in
 New Towne, the streets and lots adjacent to James Fort into which the
 settlement spread in the late 1620s and 1630s. When arranged chrono
 logically, the decrease in bore diameter accompanied by the increase in

 For much of the seventeenth century, smokers at Jamestown and
 across the Chesapeake could choose to use either white clay pipes
 imported in large numbers from England or red clay pipes manufactured
 in the Chesapeake. Red clay pipes were shorter and had thicker stems
 than their white clay counterparts. Smokers' choices and the resulting
 temporal and spatial patterns gleaned from archaeological excavations
 shed light on the dynamics of consumption and on Chesapeake society.
 At Jamestown locally made red clay pipes rapidly increased in popular
 ity, relative to imported white clay ones, soon after tobacco became the
 colony's staple crop. After reaching a peak of about 30 percent from 1640
 to 1660, red clay pipes began a gradual decline in popularity. They dis
 appeared at the end of the century (Figure XIV).

 During the first half of the century, when tobacco prices and economic
 opportunity were high, pipe making was probably an attractive option only
 for bound laborers, free Indians, and, intriguingly, enslaved and indentured
 Indians. The mix of English and Algonquin designs found on the pipes
 certainly suggests this conclusion, as does the occurrence of manufacturing
 debris on several plantation sites.40 Manufacturing might have become a
 more attractive option for free, landless people later in the century, but
 declining demand for local pipes limited opportunities to profit from it.

 Hundred and Carter's Grove. See James Deetz, "American Historical Archaeology:

 see Cary Carson, "Consumption," in A Companion to Colonial America, ed. Daniel
 Vickers (Maiden, Mass., 2003), 334-65.

 40 The historical meaning of locally made red clay pipes found on seventeenth
 century Chesapeake sites is a contentious subject. For the large variety of names archaeol
 ogists have invented to refer to them, including red-clay pipes, terra-cotta pipes, and
 Chesapeake pipes, see J. C. Harrington, "Tobacco Pipes from Jamestown," Quarterly

 mated by local regression.

 The exuberant designs lavished on early Chesapeake pipes attest to

 their function as costly signals. Some pipes from the first half of the cen
 tury bear the carefully worked initials, a kind of terra-cotta ego tag, of
 labor owners such as Walter Aston. Many of the earliest Jamestown red
 clay pipes come from archaeological deposits associated with Structure
 112, which was probably Governor John Harvey's dwelling. At Rich Neck
 Plantation, almost all the pipes from the period of Richard Kemp's own
 ership in the 1640s were locally made. This evidence supports the idea
 that some members of the colonial elite smoked locally made pipes. At
 Saint John's, Secretary John Lewger's plantation near Saint' Marys City,

 the spatial distribution of locally made pipes is radically different from
 that of imported ones. Apparently, only servants smoked locally made
 pipes at Saint John's in the 1640s, and they did so in a separate quarter
 located some distance from Lewger's dwelling. This pattern contrasts
 sharply with the one for Rich Neck, where the spatial distributions of
 imported and locally made pipes are nearly identical, implying that
 Kemp, his peers, and his servants smoked the same kinds of pipes.

 In the second half of the century, the use of locally made red clay
 pipes was increasingly limited to servants, slaves, and the free poor. The
 spatial distribution of locally made pipes on plantation sites from this
 period typically falls into distinct clusters, suggesting that different
 social groups used only locally made red or imported white pipes. The
 distinctiveness of these distributions is a function of the social segrega
 tion of domestic spaces. At Clifts Plantation on the Potomac River in
 Westmoreland County, Virginia, for example, there was considerable
 overlap in the use of space by owners and laborers in the last quarter of
 the century (Figure XV). On the other hand, at Compton on the
 Patuxent River in Maryland, living areas of the two groups were distinct
 during the third quarter of the century (Figure XVI).41

 In assemblages dating to the same period at Jamestown, higher pro
 portions of locally made red clay pipes are usually accompanied by
 higher than expected proportions of larger bore diameter imported
 white clay pipes. This correlation confirms the usage of both by individ
 uals of lower economic standing. By the end of the century, however,
 larger bore diameter pipes were sufficiently affordable and locally made
 pipes considered too parochial by the dwindling number of indentured
 servants and a rapidly growing number of enslaved Africans, many of
 whom were probably already familiar with the imported white clay pipes
 that circulated across the Atlantic world.

 Chesapeake elites gave up locally made pipes for imported ones to

 make it easier for elite visitors from the larger Atlantic world to decode
 their intentions and power. The demise of locally made pipes coincides
 with quickened economic and political interactions with English elites,
 whether government officials or well-connected immigrants, who
 appeared on the scene in greater numbers at midcentury.42 It is probably
 no accident that use of locally made pipes began to decline at Jamestown
 at about the same time brick building increased.

 Relative frequency of locally made red clay pipes compared with imported
 white clay pipes at Clifts Plantation, Westmoreland County, Virginia. The
 contours represent the extent to which the proportion of red clay pipes (rela
 tive to red and white ones combined) found in excavation quadrants, whose
 centers are represented as points, departs from the site-wide average. The
 departures are estimated as (observed proportion ? site-wide average propor
 tion) / site-wide average proportion. Thus negative numbers mean the pro
 portion found in that area was lower than average, whereas positive numbers
 represent greater-than-average proportions. Red clay pipes are concentrated in
 higher-than-expected frequencies to the north and west of the principal
 dwelling. Laborers and labor owners apparently used this structure, albeit dif
 ferent parts of it. The outbuilding to the south has only average proportions
 of red clay pipes, suggesting shared use by both social groups. A color version

 The Dynamics of House Planning in the Chesapeake

 Brick construction in the Chesapeake mirrored its growing use in
 England in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, where it not
 only improved the quality and comfort of houses but also paralleled a
 reconfiguration of traditional room arrangements. It is possible to dis
 cern two different dynamics at work behind changes in house plans on
 both sides of the Atlantic, one related to changing social and economic
 relationships between house owners and their servants and slaves; the
 other, to the consumer revolution and costly signaling. Architectural his

 determine functions of spaces are mindful that room designations sug
 gestive of restricted or singular uses in reality encompassed a variety of
 activities in the daily routines of family members, servants, slaves, and
 visitors. Through most of the seventeenth century, the hall in England
 and the Chesapeake was a large multipurpose room located in the center
 of most dwellings where families prepared, cooked, and ate their meals,
 performed odd jobs, played games, stored farm equipment, and enter
 tained guests. In many households servants shared this space with their
 employers as they ate, worked, and slept in a room filled with chairs,
 chests, tables, bedding, hoes, and cooking utensils. Near the hall was a
 secondary room, known variously as the parlor, chamber, or inner room,
 which served as the principal bedchamber for the master as well as a
 more private space for domestic chores and entertainment. These spatial
 relationships are sensitive indicators of contemporary cultural habits and
 social attitudes, and in the Chesapeake they changed dramatically dur
 ing the course of the seventeenth century.

 Scores of excavations in tidewater Virginia and Maryland during the
 last thirty years have recovered fragments of a landscape where English
 inheritance and New World experimentation combined to produce a great
 variety of house types. By the late 1970s, however, scholars began to con
 struct narratives that made sense of the bewildering array of forms found in
 the ground. They traced the consignment of many household functions
 such as the processing and storage of foodstuffs into separate service struc
 tures and observed the increasing privatization of domestic spaces as planta
 tion laborers were moved out of the house into separate quarters. According
 to these historians of Chesapeake material culture, the transformation of
 domestic architecture had little to do with the warm climate of the region
 but was instead driven by the insatiable demand for laborers to work
 tobacco fields. Nearly three-quarters of the immigrants who came to
 Maryland and Virginia in the seventeenth century arrived as indentured ser
 vants. They appeared in increasing numbers from the 1630s until the 1660s.
 These young men had few kinship ties in the Chesapeake, differing signifi
 cantly from the example of farmhands traditionally employed in many parts
 of rural England. English farms were often worked by members of the com
 munity, sometimes the sons and daughters of neighbors and friends.
 Servants were part of the household, working and living alongside their
 masters. The dynamics of laborers who served Chesapeake masters strained
 the social boundaries inherent in traditional English house plans, which had
 encouraged the mingling of family members and servants in common
 rooms. Increasingly, white indentured servants and black slaves in Virginia
 and Maryland were less welcome within the tobacco planter s dwelling.43

 Fieldwork conducted in the last quarter century has confirmed a
 number of arguments?from the elimination of English plan types to
 the delineation of domestic service functions into separate outbuildings
 to the relocation of servants and slaves out of the main dwelling?that
 Cary Carson and his collaborators made in their 1981 essay. This subse
 quent field research, however, suggests that progression toward a distinc
 tive regional farmstead was neither smooth nor linear. And now that
 many more sites have been excavated, archaeologists can document the
 timing of these events and the range of regional variations more pre
 cisely. Many elements associated with later Chesapeake plantations are
 found at sites dating as early as the second quarter of the seventeenth
 century, though even at the end of the century some planters still experi
 mented with house plans that earlier settlers had long discarded. The
 unevenness of the progression is due to demographics. An inhospitable
 climate and a host of diseases killed immigrants at an intolerable rate
 even by seventeenth-century standards. An imbalanced sex ratio made
 the establishment of stable households and the natural increase of popu
 lation all but impossible. Only the continuous influx of new immigrants
 to the Chesapeake sustained the population.44

 1550-1830 (Basingstoke, Eng., 2000). Historians of the early Chesapeake have traced the
 transformation from indentured white servants working in the tobacco fields to enslaved
 Africans in the last decades of the seventeenth century. As the supply of indentured ser
 vants declined in the 1670s and 1680s, planters turned increasingly to the importation of
 slaves, first from the Caribbean and then from Africa. By the 1690s and early 1700s, black
 slaves constituted between two-thirds and three-quarters of the unfree labor force in the
 Chesapeake. See Menard, "From Servants to Slaves: The Transformation of the

 all provincial and county-level officeholders had acquired slaves. See Coombs, "Building

 It is useful to compare the Chesapeake's architectural progression with

 New England's. After the great migration of the 1630s and early 1640s,
 immigration to New England became a trickle. The willingness to experi
 ment with new house types diminished and house plans in New England
 quickly coalesced around a few types within a generation. New
 Englanders found that many of the old patterns worked well in the New
 World and felt little need to experiment with new forms. In the
 Chesapeake, however, a continuing supply of immigrants ensured that
 Chesapeake architecture would be influenced by new ideas that arrived
 with each new group. Merchant-planters who had been part of the com
 mercial bustle of the metropolis were especially aware of new trends in
 domestic planning that flourished in London and throughout southern
 England.45 In the second half of the century, these forms began to
 appear in a few buildings erected by a small but socially prominent class
 of newcomers who saw no reason to jettison metropolitan fashion
 merely because they now resided on the empire's fringe.

 In England as well as the American colonies, the seventeenth cen
 tury marked a significant break in traditional house design. In many
 parts of England, the century witnessed a revolution in housing stan
 dards as thousands of farmers, husbandmen, merchants, artisans, and

 others improved their older, medieval dwellings by flooring over rooms
 originally left open to the rafters, inserting chimney stacks in rooms
 once heated by open hearths, installing window glass in apertures for
 merly protected by wooden grills or shutters, and raising one-story
 structures to two full stories. It was a long, uneven, back-and-forth
 process that, though nearly completed in some parts of southeastern
 England by the time Jamestown was founded, scarcely affected more iso
 lated and poorer regions in the northern reaches of the mother country
 until much later in the century.46

 English farmhouses had traditionally consisted of a single range of
 rooms connected in a linear fashion. The principal entrance, often
 located along the long wall near one end of the house, led into a cross
 passage that bisected the house into two uneven sections (Figure XVII).
 At the smaller, or lower, end of the building, a door from the cross pas
 sage opened into a service room such as a kitchen, pantry, buttery, or
 even a byre for animals. An opposing doorway in the cross passage gave
 access to the all-purpose hall in the upper end that frequently joined
 another room, perhaps a parlor.

 Farmhands and family members moved through the same cross pas

 sage to reach service spaces on one side or to take a meal, work, or sleep
 in the hall in the center of the house. As long as the household was
 composed of familiar local people of similar social status, this indiscrim
 inate mingling of hired workers and family members caused few strains
 in domestic relations. To increase profit margins, however, some farmers
 chose to reduce costs by hiring day laborers from lower social ranks.
 Houses with cross passages proved less desirable when the status of
 laborers changed. They began to be replaced in many parts of England
 by what Eric Mercer and other architectural historians have called the
 undivided house, a form that did not separate the dwelling into upper
 and lower ends. In undivided houses the main entrance, which was usu

 ally located in or near the center of the front facade, led from the out
 side into either a small lobby or directly into one of the principal rooms
 (Figure XVIII).4?

 If the role of servants within the hall and other more private parts
 of the house became more circumscribed, the family still needed service
 rooms in which to cook and store goods. This necessity had a dramatic
 effect on the way men and women lived. There was a steady growth in
 domestic conveniences among all but the poorest class of English
 dwellings. Dairies, pantries, sculleries, brewhouses, and butteries could
 be added to one side or the other of the main core of rooms in an undi

 vided house. Occasionally, dairies were located in cellars below parlors
 to take advantage of the thermal qualities of subterranean storage. An
 alternative location for service functions was behind the main rooms in

 small outshots. Perhaps the greatest break with traditional domestic
 arrangements in the seventeenth century was the separation of food
 preparation from consumption. In homes of the minor gentry, prosperous
 yeomen, merchants, and professionals, food was cooked in a separate

 47 For a discussion of the emergence of the undivided house, see Mercer, English

 Vernacular Houses, 60-65. A detailed study of how these plans developed in one particular
 region can be found in Raymond B. Wood-Jones, Traditional Domestic Architecture of the
 Banbury Region (Manchester, Eng., 1963), 139-62.

 kitchen and eaten in the hall. Historian M. W. Barley has observed that
 "the integration of the kitchen into the house did more to upset the
 householder's customary ideas of the functions of rooms than any other
 development of this age." The shift in cooking from the hall to a
 kitchen meant that female family members spent more of their time
 preparing meals and doing other customary domestic chores in these
 secondary service spaces located away from the central rooms of the
 house (Figures XIX-XX) A*

 By the second half of the seventeenth century, the desire for more
 service rooms, for a kitchen separated from the hall, and for additional
 living spaces led to the construction of English houses with more spe
 cialized rooms. The old linear plan allowed little variation in circulation

 48 In New England these spaces were known as lean-tos and in Bermuda as "outlets."
 For the growth of service rooms, see M. W. Barley, The English Farmhouse and Cottage
 (London, 1961), 178-79; Anthony Quiney, "The Lobby-Entry House: Its Origins and

 separation of cooking from the hall, see Matthew Johnson, Housing Culture: Traditional
 Architecture in an English Landscape (Washington, D.C., 1993), 137. Cary Carson has
 argued for a similar occurrence in New England houses in the late seventeenth and early
 eighteenth centuries with the advent of kitchen hearths in lean-tos and double-pile
 houses. See Carson, "Culture Transfer, Culture Shock: How the English Farmhouse Was
 Redesigned for British North America," unpublished paper, 2006.

 within the house or the relationship between rooms. Therefore builders
 began to construct double-pile, or two-room deep, dwellings contained
 within a compact, squarish block, which was a substantial conceptual
 break from traditional planning ideas. With domestic chores relegated
 to the back of the house, the front rooms were reserved for more special
 ized uses and frequently given over to more polite activities. The hall
 emerged as a more formal entertaining room. In wealthier rural house
 holds, the parlor evolved into a room in which family members dined.
 Elsewhere, especially in poorer households, the hall remained the princi
 pal bedchamber.49

 The switch from a lower- and upper-end orientation to a front-and
 back arrangement accompanied a cultural shift in the perception of the
 house's shell. Renaissance ideas regarding scale, symmetry, and propor
 tion profoundly influenced the appearance of facades. Whereas the
 function of earlier houses was obvious from the location of doors and

 lobby-entry house has two or three rooms and the main entrance opens
 into a small vestibule in front of the central chimney stack. With a cen
 tral passage, more generous entrances could be made to all the principal
 rooms in single- and double-pile houses. A large, showy staircase in the
 central passage bespoke the wealth of the owner and the increasing
 importance of second-floor chambers, something nearly impossible to
 achieve with the cramped enclosed staircases, called winders, associated
 with lobby-entry plans.50 This intersection of academic design and the

 growing population of tobacco planters and servants who came from dif
 ferent corners of the kingdom. That there was so much experimentation
 in the Chesapeake should come as no surprise given the stresses on tra
 ditional house planning. It is remarkable, then, that by the late seven
 teenth century Chesapeake architecture had developed its own
 distinctive forms with plans that reflected the needs of its cre?le culture.
 Yet no matter how much this landscape of small farmhouses, dispersed
 service buildings, and separate quarters for servants and slaves differed
 from that of England or New England, the spatial organization of
 household activities was similar in all those places.

 The polite house was an emerging form in the Chesapeake that
 looked to England for inspiration. At first it was the prerogative of a few
 and expressed in limited ways: classical forms and finish, a limited range
 of public entertaining rooms, and more generous, if controlled, circula
 tion. By the second quarter of the eighteenth century, more of the
 Chesapeake gentry had adopted elements of the polite house. Specialized
 and private spaces such as dining rooms, studies, and bedchambers
 became necessities. To accommodate these extra spaces, builders experi
 mented with houses that had a double depth of rooms, sometimes
 arranged in back wings, and also built box-shaped dwellings with rectan
 gular footprints, echoing the type that had become popular among the
 English gentry, merchants, and professionals as town residences and
 country villas. Like their English counterparts, the main rooms were
 increasingly given over to more restrictive uses, often including new
 spaces for genteel entertainment such as dining and tea drinking. The
 absence of standing early structures in Maryland and Virginia compared
 with dozens of large frame houses that survive in Connecticut and
 Massachusetts often led earlier architectural scholarship to stress obvious
 differences between the New England and Chesapeake landscapes, and in
 doing so scholars failed to recognize common forces that affected develop
 ment in both areas. The polite house trumped regional building traditions
 that evolved from distinct economic and social conditions in seventeenth

 century England and its American colonies. The Chesapeake's particular
 circumstances shaped the development of domestic architecture, but
 much of the emerging polite house was part of a broader trend in house
 planning in England and throughout the American colonies: the transfor
 mation of dwellings from workplaces to showplaces.51

 Once tobacco began to drive Virginia's economy, colonists spilled
 out of Jamestown and their palisaded villages to settle in dispersed plan
 tations. The rural farmhouse with its supporting agricultural buildings
 became a hallmark of Virginia and Maryland. Elements of that land
 scape began forming in the late company period (1620-24) with special
 ized tobacco houses and two-room dwellings. Colonists gave up the
 elongated barracks of the fort period at Jamestown in favor of smaller
 houses for family members and their few unrelated laborers. In the sec
 ond and third quarters of the seventeenth century, Chesapeake colonists
 established many more aspects of the plantation landscape. The home
 lots of these farmsteads held the main dwelling house with a few
 detached service structures. Occasionally, planters built separate quarters
 for their indentured servants during this period, but servants continued
 to be an integral part of the household where they worked, ate, social
 ized, and slept. Houses more than fourteen or sixteen feet in width were
 large enough to offer headroom beneath the slope of the rafters. The
 loft, reached by a ladder stair from the hall, supplied additional sleeping
 space and storage for produce. A few planters experimented with
 detached kitchens, but for most the hall remained the principal room
 where meals were prepared.

 If a dwelling had dairies and butteries, they often appeared in small
 shed rooms attached to the side or back of the hall or were partitioned
 off from the hall in the main block of the house. Though the archaeo
 logical evidence for partition walls within the main core can be so
 imperceptible that these spaces appear to be a single room, scholars
 know that many were subdivided into several small spaces. In 1645, f?r
 instance, a f?fteen-by-twenty-foot dwelling on the Eastern Shore of
 Virginia had a partition that separated the main room from a buttery. A
 similar division of space appeared in the house erected for Nathaniel
 Batts along the Albemarle Sound in northeast North Carolina a decade
 later. Long and narrow service spaces, sometimes no more than six feet
 wide, were hived off parlors and halls by thin plank partitions in many
 seventeenth-century English farmhouses and must have been common
 in early Chesapeake houses.52 Though there were many ways to accom
 modate services within the house, the integration of work and living
 spaces characterized most houses of this era.

 A few colonists built houses with cross passages (Figure XXI). These
 plans inevitably functioned in the traditional English manner whereby

 servants and masters used the same entrance and worked alongside each
 other in the lower end of the house and in the hall. Generally associated
 with more prominent plantations, a cross-passage house dating from the
 mid-i620s appeared at Site A at Martin's Hundred in James City
 County, Virginia, and was perhaps the residence of William Harwood,
 the former administrator of that particular plantation. At the Boldrup
 site in Newport News, Structure 2 was built in the 1630s with a lower
 end room on one side of a cross passage and a three-bay upper end, pre
 sumably incorporating the hall with a smaller parlor beyond it.
 Unfortunately, the site exhibits a typical problem encountered when
 excavating many seventeenth-century buildings: the hearth was so shal
 low that evidence of it did not survive. The scant evidence suggests the
 lower room was heated, but the exact division of the three-bay upper
 end remains uncertain.53

 the mid-seventeenth century, but the most common form consisted of

 wide enough to offer headroom. These undivided houses gave direct
 access into one of the main rooms or into a small lobby or entry porch
 (Figure XXII). Porches appear increasingly in the archaeological and
 documentary records in the second half of the century.54 Measuring
 from five to fourteen feet in width and a similar range in length, they
 could be fully enclosed or partially open on the sides. A porch offered a
 sheltered buffer between the outside and the hall and included an addi

 tional chamber or storage room on its second floor. Lobby-entry houses
 figured prominently in the campaign to build brick row houses at
 Jamestown in the 1660s. Two of these row houses (Structures 115 and 144)
 consisted of a series of four contiguous two-story houses. Each house
 measured forty feet by twenty feet with two ground-floor rooms posi
 tioned around a central H-shaped chimney, creating an eight-foot-square
 lobby. The prevalence of the undivided house plan in towns and in the
 countryside demonstrates its adaptability on the Chesapeake frontier.

 Another undivided house type became the dominant form during
 this period, supplying the model for domestic plans in the region during
 the next two centuries. At the lower end of the social scale, yeomen and
 cottagers in some regions of England erected two-room houses with one
 or two gable-end chimneys or, alternatively, with a chimney located on
 one of the long walls. The principal entrance led into the hall, the larger
 of the two rooms, and direct access was sometimes buffered by an entry
 porch (Figure XXIII).55 Similarly arranged houses appeared in the
 Chesapeake in the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Based on
 archaeological sites in which chimney locations are known, dwellings
 with end chimneys rose to 74 percent of the total building stock in the
 third quarter of the seventeenth century, whereas center-chimney plans
 dropped to 26 percent, having reached a high of 41 percent the previous
 quarter. As colonists refined and adjusted the plan to match the bay

 54 Examples of early porches appear at the stone house at Flowerdew Hundred (ca.
 1619-20) and Structure 2 (ca. 1650) at Nansemond Fort, Suffolk, Va. See Carson et al.,
 Winterthur Portfolio 16: 152; Deetz, Flowerdew Hundred, 35. The brick house erected by
 John Page at Middle Plantation in 1662 had a thirteen and one-half foot-square
 entrance porch matched by a slightly larger stair tower in the rear, an arrangement simi
 lar to that found a few years later at Bacon's Castle in Surry Co., where the porch and
 stair towers measure eleven feet wide by ten feet deep. The late-seventeenth-century
 porch towers added to Houses 3 and 4 of Structure 144 at Jamestown are thirteen feet
 wide by twelve feet deep. By contrast the porch at Smith's Ordinary, a timber-framed
 building in Saint Marys City dating from the late 1660s, was five feet wide by seven feet
 long. On the prevalence of porches in estate inventories, see Upton, "Early Vernacular
 Architecture in Southeastern Virginia," 1: 172. For an early site with porches, see

 system inherent in the structural logic of the Virginia house's riven clap
 board carpentry, the essential core of a regional house type had emerged.

 Landscapes of Segregation and Specialization

 The segregation of laborers and the movement of services into out

 buildings became commonplace in the last decades of the seventeenth
 century. More plantations had subsidiary structures arrayed around the
 main house in the form of detached kitchens, quarters, and service
 buildings. New building types, such as smokehouses, that only appeared
 in documents at the beginning of the eighteenth century make explicit
 this transformation of service spaces. Conversely, the traditional English
 buttery, an internal storage room for liquids, foodstuffs, and implements
 for food preparation, virtually disappeared from probate inventories as
 cooking migrated from the house to separate kitchens.56

 Never completely banished from planters' houses because of the

 need for domestic service, Chesapeake servants and slaves nonetheless
 ate, slept, and socialized in separate quarters. A French traveler to
 Virginia in 1687 observed that planters "whatever their rank . . . build
 only two rooms with some closets on the ground floor, & two rooms in
 the attic above; but they build several like this according to their means.
 They build also a separate kitchen, a separate house for the Christian
 slaves [indentured servants], one for the negro slaves, & several to dry
 the tobacco, so that when you come to the home of a person of some
 means, you think you are entering a fairly large village."57

 The Chesapeake farmstead was dramatically reorganized to create
 separate realms for work functions, housing for free and enslaved labor
 ers, and polite space. Substantial planters who controlled a large labor
 force of indentured servants or who, increasingly by midcentury, turned
 to African slaves to work their tobacco fields may well have been among
 the first to establish the type of plantation described by the French visi
 tor. In the i66os Thomas Ludwell, a powerful associate of Governor
 William Berkeley, came into possession of Richard Kemp's plantation at
 Rich Neck. During the next two decades, Ludwell remodeled Kemp's
 brick house and kitchen and erected a number of earthfast structures

 just beyond a fence behind the kitchen. Some of these buildings may
 have served as work buildings whereas others probably housed some of
 Ludwell's enslaved workforce.58

 Even on more modest plantations, the pattern of segregation was
 well articulated. In 1679 Thomas Atkinson purchased sixty-four acres in
 James City County, Virginia, on which he cultivated tobacco with the
 help of a few indentured white servants or slaves during the next thirty
 years (Figure XXIV). During the course of his ownership, Atkinson
 erected a two-room earthfast dwelling with one gable-end chimney and
 a small shed addition. A quarter-kitchen that stood approximately
 twenty feet off the back corner of the main dwelling was also of earth
 fast construction and contained an offset fireplace at one end with two
 subfloor pits, one in the common location directly in front of the
 hearth. Near the quarter was a small, four-post, unheated work build
 ing. A paled fence ran parallel to the back wall of the main dwelling and
 separated the site into two distinct sections with Atkinson and his fam
 ily on one side of the line and his servants or slaves and services housed
 on the other. A gate a few feet south of the house allowed access
 between the divided home lot.59

 As the quarter at the Atkinson site demonstrates, the living spaces

 of laborers, now increasingly separate, were changing. The end of the
 seventeenth century saw the emergence of a novel architectural form in
 the region: houses, likely slave houses, whose floors were riddled with
 multiple subfloor pits. The pits were apparently subterranean closets in
 which enslaved men and women stored personal possessions. Evidence
 of this practice relates to a shift in how laborers were provisioned. In the
 eighteenth century, slaves were given weekly food rations on an individ

 60 Evidence of this practice raises an interesting and so far unasked question: why is
 the evidence so scant for multiple pits beneath the floors of houses used by indentured
 servants and slaves earlier in the seventeenth century? Saint John's in Saint Marys City
 offers a good example. Here the early servant quarter behind the main house initially had
 no subfloor pit and later acquired only one. A similar situation existed at Richard Kemp's
 Rich Neck in the 1640s and 1650s. Again, there was only a single large subfloor pit under

 that servants and slaves may have been fed differently; perhaps food was
 provided for communally on a daily basis and hence there was no need
 for individual pits. Individual, weekly provisioning likely emerged late
 in the seventeenth century as part of an owner strategy to shift all the
 costs of food preparation and some of the costs of procurement onto
 laborers.

 Faunal evidence may document the emergence of this new provi

 sioning system. Salt pork was a key component of slave rations in the
 eighteenth century. Slave owners used pork instead of beef because its
 lower water content made it easier to preserve. Large eighteenth-century
 slave quarter assemblages have higher frequencies of pig bones relative to
 cow bones than their nonslave contemporaries. It should be possible to
 chart the emergence of a pork-based provisioning strategy by tracking
 changes in the frequency of pig remains relative to cow remains in
 seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century assemblages. Such values
 decline for most of the century (see Figure VIII). This trend levels out
 in the third quarter of the century. But then, surprisingly, the frequency
 of pig remains increases significantly in the last decades of the seven
 teenth century. The abandonment of daily, communal provisioning of
 food to laborers in favor of an individual-based provisioning system is a
 likely explanation.61

 Planters who could afford to construct more than the most rudi

 mentary structures turned to plans that limited chance interaction of
 servants and family members outside certain prescribed patterns.
 Though some native-born colonists still chose older English arrange
 ments, as Nathaniel Pope Jr. did when he built a three-unit, cross
 passage manor house around 1670 at Clifts Plantation in Westmoreland
 County, most settled on the two-room undivided house. Over time the
 ubiquitous two-room house improved in quality. The trend was to
 enlarge the depth of the house, often to twenty feet, the most simple

 a building that was likely a kitchen and quarter, and there are no pits under the floors of
 earthfast buildings that excavators infer were used to house slaves in the third quarter of
 the seventeenth century. The earliest archaeological descriptions of subfloor pits can be
 found in William M. Kelso, Kingsmill Plantations, 1619-1800: Archaeology of Country Life
 in Colonial Virginia (Orlando, Fla., 1984). For a brief discussion of their functional signif

 framing could accommodate without overly taxing the complexity of the
 roof system. A wider house meant that the garret could be fitted up as
 habitable chambers. Ceiled, finished, and accessed by a staircase rather
 than a ladder stair, a few may have been heated by a fireplace. With the
 increased use of dormers, the upper floors of genteel houses contained
 space far superior to the dark, cold, and cramped garrets of their earlier
 counterparts. Increasingly, at the turn of the eighteenth century, the inte
 riors of houses received more genteel finishes that masked evidence of the
 framing. A system called flush framing was devised to hide a building's
 structure. Interior wall planes were evened out by enlarging secondary
 members such as studs and reducing the depths of the principal timbers.
 The new framing convention changed the structural dynamics of the
 building, and the joinery of these members was altered accordingly. A
 handful of these improved houses from the late seventeenth and early
 eighteenth centuries has survived because later owners found them adapt
 able to warrant substantial repairs to the lower parts of their frames,
 whereas others had their wooden shell encased in brick walls.62

 The small, enclosed entrance porches that had furnished an inter
 mediary space between the outside and the hall faded from fashion in
 the first quarter of the eighteenth century. Their disappearance corre
 sponded with the rise in popularity of the center passage in the homes of
 wealthier planters and especially merchants and prosperous tradesmen in
 towns. The stair passage facilitated the reordering of household activities
 by offering a means for family members, servants, and visitors to move
 between rooms and floors without having to pass through one room to
 enter another. This development facilitated setting aside certain rooms
 for specific functions. Center passages not only kept uninvited visitors
 from entering directly into the principal rooms of the house but also
 supplied a waiting room for servants.63

 The center passage enhanced the development of the polite house,
 where rooms dedicated to specific, highly specialized, and socialized

 that English framed buildings were built earlier in the century but remained a rarity until
 the early eighteenth century. On Pope's House at Clifts Plantation, see Neiman, Northern
 Neck of Virginia Historical Magazine 28: 3099-3103. Frame houses later encased in brick
 are spread across the Chesapeake. Notable examples include Holly Hill and Cedar Park in
 Anne Arundel Co., Md., dated by dendrochronology to 1699 and 1702, respectively. The
 Matthew Jones House in Newport News, Va., was built about 1720. All three structures
 were bricked sometime in the second or third quarter of the eighteenth century.

 functions began to reshape the arrangement of living spaces. Adoption
 of a new set of rules and behaviors followed English ideas of gentility
 and guided the reshuffling of space in Chesapeake housing. A growing
 tendency to entertain guests away from the daily chores of housework
 led to the setting aside of rooms for the reception of visitors. These
 rooms contained dedicated implements for entertainment, including
 new forms of seating furniture, tea sets, and fashionable tableware that
 allowed the host and invited company to demonstrate their refined
 tastes in social interactions and to display the material goods that sig
 naled their understanding of the role of ritual objects in genteel society.
 To underscore the social importance of these entertaining rooms, they
 were most commonly located at the front of the house on the ground
 floor. The old hall now shed all functions save that of reception and the
 new fashion for tea ceremonies. Renamed the parlor, this room and the
 dining room became the entertainment suite. Along with the center pas
 sage, these spaces received the best architectural finishes, such as carved
 chimneypieces, paneled wainscoting, and built-in cabinets displaying
 costly ceramics and glass.64 Across Maryland and Virginia, planters,
 merchants, and professionals upgraded and remodeled the public arena
 of their domestic lives in accord with metropolitan-inspired ideals and
 rituals of genteel living.

 Scholars can trace rooms specifically set aside for social rituals to a

 few Chesapeake houses in the late seventeenth century. Cary Carson has
 interpreted the massive two-story wing that Governor Berkeley added to
 his original E-shaped dwelling at Green Spring in the early 1660s, for
 example, as a series of grand entertaining rooms set above an arcaded
 basement and used in much the same manner as a traditional English
 lodge on a large estate to which parties retired on special occasions for
 feasts and other amusements.65 The desire to accommodate polite enter
 tainments in appropriate settings led rich planters, merchants, and
 provincial officials to experiment with a variety of plans that offered at
 least three principal ground-floor rooms: a dining room, a parlor, and a
 bedchamber. To accommodate these three rooms, elite Chesapeake resi
 dents sometimes built single-pile houses with a rear range, forming an L
 or T shape. In 1694 Lewis Burwell built one of the most imposing of
 these houses at Fairfield, in Gloucester County, Virginia (Figures
 XXV-XXVI). This T-shaped brick house had a central entrance at the

 flanked by large rooms heated by internal gable-end chimneys.

 Long before the cubical mass and symmetrical facade of the gover

 nor's palace in Williamsburg furnished a conspicuous model for elite
 housing, a few gentlemen had fully formed double-pile dwellings. Their
 rear rooms were nearly equal in size to the front ones, not merely
 smaller, unheated service rooms beneath a shed roof. Archaeologists have
 determined that Arlington, a three-story brick house erected in the mid
 16705 by merchant and councilor John Custis II on the Eastern Shore of
 Virginia, anticipated many of the attributes of the grand eighteenth
 century gentry house (Figure XXVII). A fully developed double-pile
 plan with either three or four sidewall chimneys, like Fairfield and
 Arlington, had a central entrance that led either directly into a large hall
 flanked by smaller entertaining rooms or into a center passage between
 the two front rooms. If the latter it was a precocious example of such a

 a central, spacious staircase that led to a second-floor great parlor, one of
 the first in the colonies.

 Arlington and Green Spring stood at the pinnacle of elite housing in
 the seventeenth-century Chesapeake. Few could emulate the plans
 devised for governors, grand provincial officials, and rich merchants.
 Though these dwelling designs were out of reach for most planters, they
 nonetheless represented the emergence of the polite house in the
 Chesapeake. Most freeholders had to make do with far more modest
 accommodations than those of Custis. For them private chambers, spe
 cialized entertaining rooms, and restricted circulation spaces were unob
 tainable.

 The notion that the one-room dwelling?"a tumble-down, 12-by-n
 foot cabin with a dirt floor and a clay-lined wooden fireplace"?was the
 most pervasive building form in the Chesapeake has been espoused by
 many scholars. Seventeenth-century documents indicate the presence of
 small houses throughout the region. Archaeological data collected for
 sites dating from 1650 to 1720, however, suggest that all types of
 dwellings (main houses, tenements, and quarters) with a single room on
 the ground floor represented about 24 percent of all buildings. In con
 trast two-room structures made up nearly 40 percent of the total. If
 quarters are taken out of these data, then one-room dwellings such as
 Chalkley's in Anne Arundel County, Maryland (a sixteen and one-half
 by twenty-foot dwelling with a gable-end chimney built around 1677),
 make up only 10 percent of the evidence, and almost all these examples
 date from the 1690s or later. Two-room buildings, on the other hand,
 account for the largest proportion of the total (Table II).67 Without

 67 J. Richard Rivoire, Homeplaces: Traditional Domestic Architecture of Charles
 County, Maryland (La Plata, Md., 1990), 6 (quotation). On the assumption that one
 room houses were predominant, see Upton, "Early Vernacular Architecture in
 Southeastern Virginia," 1: 153. Clear statistical evidence for this assumption appears in the
 1798 federal tax in which enumerators surveyed the housing stock of the new nation.
 Surviving tax rolls for a number of Maryland counties suggest that most people living
 along the northern fringe of the Chesapeake Bay inhabited modest dwellings, perhaps
 with only one ground-floor room. In 1798 the median size of dwellings in Baltimore Co.
 was 432 square feet (a median length and width of eighteen by twenty-four). In Anne
 Arundel Co. the median size was 360 square feet (eighteen by twenty). The size of houses
 in Prince Georges Co. matched those in Baltimore Co. at 432 square feet (twenty-four by
 eighteen), and in Somerset Co. on the lower Eastern Shore the median was 400 square
 feet (twenty by twenty). Some of these small dwellings may have contained two rooms,
 but the data suggest a preponderance of one-room plans. See Elizabeth Gallow,
 "Observations from the 1798 Tax Record for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Prince George's,
 and Somerset Counties, Maryland," report for the Architectural Research Department,
 Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, 2004. In estimating the size of houses in the database,
 room counts include all spaces exclusive of cellars, garrets, and circulation (such as porches,
 passages, and stair towers). Sheds have been included. A table delineating square footage of
 dwellings over time is available online at http://0ieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Jul07/graham.html.

 Notes: Buildings with two rooms are the most common form throughout the
 seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Considering the number of two-story,
 hall-and-parlor houses constructed in Jamestown in the second half of the seven
 teenth century, a two-room footprint can be seen as even more dominant. Quarters
 are not included in the count. Rooms are considered definable space within the

 closets, cellars, and garrets.

 question, the two-room house was used from the earliest days of expan
 sion beyond the Jamestown fort and the palisades of the particular plan
 tations and remained one of the most common dwelling arrangements
 throughout the seventeenth century.

 The fashion for one-room houses in the eighteenth century may
 have been due in part to technology as much as to a change in living
 arrangements. The trend toward better-framed structures parallels
 increased building width, which in turn allowed for more generous space
 in the garrets of houses. The better quality of the loft above a well
 joined staircase allowed a planter to add a secondary bedchamber there.
 As the number of detached kitchens grew, the hall was used less for ser
 vice and work activities and more for entertainment. The master and his

 wife may have placed their bed in the hall, but their bedchamber had
 always doubled for entertainment purposes when it was located in the
 inner room. In the eighteenth century, then, the hall became a more spe
 cialized space for entertainment and, with the principal bed in it, func
 tioned much like the old parlor or inner room. It was natural that the
 expulsion of service and servants from the core of the house allowed the
 remaining functions of the ground floor to be condensed into a single
 room. Over time dwelling plans became simpler.

 The one-room plan was also promoted by the use of log construction,
 which was favored over post-in-the-ground framing on the eighteenth
 century frontier in the southside, Piedmont, and Shenandoah Valley.
 Though it was technically possible to build multiroom log houses, the
 technique was most resourceful when applied to single-room structures.
 Limiting log lengths to make them easier to handle and simplifying
 joinery made this building form a staple in the expanding Chesapeake
 world. The old evidence used by historians to defend a universal prefer
 ence for one-room houses may also reflect the rise of log construction on
 the frontier and its proliferation in older parts of the tidewater in the
 second half of the eighteenth century.

 Adaptation and Innovation

 Lost and discarded tools and possessions now coming to light in the

 Jamestown excavations suggest that in the weeks and months following
 the initial construction of the fort, its inhabitants stumbled into a

 process that persisted through the colony's early chaotic decades. At first
 colonists inserted themselves and the myriad activities that constitute
 daily life aggressively into the Virginia wilderness. When English tools,
 implements, and manners of arranging their households proved ineffec
 tive, the colonists attempted to refit their English ways to their new sur
 roundings and new circumstances. When tinkering and adjusting failed
 to fix mismatches between what might be called Old World solutions
 and New World riddles, whatever did not work was discarded altogether.
 Jamestown was thus a graveyard not only for those unfortunates who
 died but also for tools and ideas that did not work. Trial and error was

 everywhere an informal process that identified a handful of ideas that
 found broad application. These ideas were so distinctive that they
 became inseparably identified with Virginia and in time with the
 Chesapeake. Only a few of those strategies, however, seem to have
 gained application beyond the palisaded boundaries of the Virginia
 Company-era settlements. Jamestown and other early settlements con
 trast significantly from what followed the collapse of company rule.68

 English ways, whether they involved protection, diet, or buildings,
 did not simply appear in the New World and, after undergoing a trial
 and-error process, develop along a straight-line trajectory into American
 ways. In the Chesapeake the progression was considerably less elegant
 and far more complex. The successive waves of immigrants from across
 England brought cultural traditions and ideas that were archaic or pro
 gressive to the Chesapeake colonies. Thus old as well as new English
 ideas continually refreshed the storehouse of solutions to the problems

 of getting along on the Chesapeake frontier. There was indeed a win
 nowing process and an adaptive one by which serviceable ideas were
 selected, modified, and creatively transformed. Yet the mix was ever sub
 ject to additions from abroad and always changed by local conditions,
 including the aspirations and prejudices of the colonists. Some immi
 grants may have been traditionalists by temperament but were forced to
 be improvisers out of necessity.

 Archaeological and documentary evidence reveal that the distinctive
 methods of house construction, house plans, and domestic uses first
 explored by Cary Carson and his colleagues emerged after the demise of
 the company. Freed from the constraints and expectations of the com
 pany and its sponsors, post-1624 individual entrepreneurial farmsteads
 evolved into independent plantations more widely dispersed than their
 counterparts in England or New England. These settlements consisted
 of main dwellings that were increasingly surrounded by smaller, separate
 buildings for food storage, tobacco processing, and livestock stabling.
 Extensive archaeological data suggest that this plantation landscape pat
 tern appeared much earlier than once thought. Building technology, for
 example, rapidly responded to local conditions. The minimally prepared
 timbers and efficiently joined earthfast frames with walls and roofs cov
 ered with riven clapboards became so identified with the region that by
 midcentury the structure they created was called a Virginia house.
 Though the framing technology of riven clapboard carpentry was used
 for a variety of house plans, the two-room arrangement so closely associ
 ated with nonelite housing in the region became the standard way to
 configure domestic space once the company fell and profits from
 tobacco became the driving force throughout the Chesapeake.

 Evidence from archaeological excavations have revealed that the

 two-room version of the Virginia house was the hallmark of the dis
 persed farmsteads that dotted the countryside seemingly everywhere in
 the region and that it appeared much earlier than previously thought.
 Archaeologists have pinpointed other physical elements of the plantation
 landscape and helped to link them to the lives of frontier Virginians. At
 midcentury servants and slaves on small and modest-sized plantations
 still resided within the master's dwelling. A quarter of a century later,
 however, many plantation owners had relocated their labor force to a
 variety of outlying service buildings, kitchens, and separate quarters.69

 69 Dell Upton has argued that the mean size of a planter's house in Virginia

 increased from 1640 to 1670, peaked in the 1670s and 1680s, and then steadily declined
 through the early decades of the eighteenth century. He attributed this pattern of expan
 sion and contraction to the initial accommodation of laborers in their master's house,
 which was later followed by their expulsion in the late seventeenth century, esp. as the
 labor force changed from white indentured servants to black slaves. See Upton, "Early

 At the same time, the spaces within the main house became increasingly
 private and devoted to the specialized activities that served as markers of
 the owner's social status. The migration of laborers to unattached build
 ings is mirrored in clusters of locally made red clay pipes found near
 outbuildings occupied by servants and slaves, whereas imported white
 clay pipes are distributed around the hearths and doors of the planta
 tion's principal dwelling.

 At some point masters desired to limit contact between their fami
 lies and their laborers. The rise of slavery seems to hold obvious
 explanatory power, but even at the end of the seventeenth century there
 were few slaves in Virginia and Maryland. On the other hand, these
 slaves were concentrated on the plantations of a few wealthy landowners
 who had the economic means to build separate slave quarters and the
 social need to redefine boundaries between laborers and household resi

 dents. Yet this expulsion of alien laborers from the main house was not
 entirely driven by the increasing pervasiveness of slavery in the
 Chesapeake; it was part of a broader transatlantic trend occurring simul
 taneously across the English world. Houses on both sides of the Atlantic
 became more socially restrictive. In comparable rural houses occupied by
 members of similar social ranks, servants were all but banished from the

 main dwelling. Though domestic servants continued to work inside the
 house, few were live-in residents. Ancient relationships between farm
 families and their servants that had long promoted easy interaction
 within the household broke down. To increase profit margins, English
 farmers in many regions began to reduce costs by hiring day laborers,
 many of whom were from lower social classes. The arrangement of
 domestic space and its use changed to accommodate the new social
 order.70 Added to these explanations was the contemporary development
 of the idea of a polite house as a reflection of the owner's social intent.
 In Maryland and Virginia, these dwellings were not especially large and
 most were of wood-frame construction. After midcentury, however, a
 small but increasing number of rich men whose wealth did not entirely
 depend on the price of tobacco consolidated their status and influence
 by building impressive brick homes and sponsoring construction of a

 Vernacular Architecture in Southeastern Virginia," i: 154-74. As Fraser D. Neiman has
 pointed out, the documentary evidence is ambiguous. The listing of room names does not
 necessarily imply that those spaces were a part of the dwelling house as opposed to a
 detached service building. See Neiman, "Temporal Patterning in House Plans," 270-72.

 handful of brick public buildings. A more forceful wave of masonry con
 struction only occurred in earnest in the 1720s and 1730s.

 The phenomenon of the polite house was as common in England
 and New England as in the Chesapeake, and everywhere it demanded
 refinement of social behavior, displays of wealth, and the privacy
 required for entertaining. Uncontrolled servant access to the private
 recesses of the master's house and frequent unscripted interaction
 between laborers and family members or guests would not do. The
 polite house offered a means of checking the access and controlling
 interaction if servants lived in separate buildings. By the end of the sev
 enteenth century, all these factors converged in the Chesapeake to create
 a plantation model in which laborers were segregated from masters and
 the planter lived in a great house that made a statement about his
 wealth, power, and status. Archaeology supplies a graphic manner in
 which to mark and measure the movement of servants and slaves out of

 the master's dwelling and can prompt scholars to reassess familiar docu
 ments and narratives.

 Evidence excavated from hundreds of sites in the last quarter cen

 tury offers fresh opportunities to analyze the social and cultural dynam
 ics that shaped everyday life in the seventeenth-century Chesapeake.
 Archaeological evidence of the emergence of distinctive regional patterns
 in shelter, sustenance, and status can be profitably studied as indepen
 dent phenomena, but the application of explanatory theories of future
 discounting and costly signaling suggests that these threads of human
 activity were entwined rather than independent and that they reflected
 shared rather than private attitudes. As the century progressed,
 Chesapeake elites more frequently evaluated their strategic options with
 a view to their long-term payoffs, resulting in decisions to build longer
 lasting houses and to embrace a meat diet that emphasized domestic ani
 mals over wild ones and cows over pigs. Construction of stylish brick
 houses suggests that initial inclinations to eschew the future yielded to a
 new social calculus. Better houses were no doubt more comfortable, yet
 they were also costly signals. Investments in improved housing and fur
 nishings played an increasingly indispensable role in competition for
 social and political leadership. Embedded in the patterns of house plans,
 tobacco pipe fragments, and other artifacts are evolving intentions that
 are at once both overt and implicit. Understanding what those inten
 tions reveal about the lives of the Chesapeake's often anonymous inhabi
 tants will require additional study of how they built houses, devised
 floor plans, finished rooms, dressed themselves, shaped landscapes,
 defined labor relations, and created foodways. Where these threads of

 toward its distinctive culture.71

 71 Thus far, the accumulation of archaeological data has outstripped the published
 analysis of it. With increased access to the information, especially through online reposi
 tories such as the infant one that undergirds this article, the analytic component should
 catch up. In Virginia the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's Department of
 Archaeological Research, the College of William and Mary's Center for Archaeological
 Research, the James River Institute for Archaeology, and the APVA/Preservation Virginia
 have been especially active in sponsoring the study of seventeenth-century sites. In
 Maryland the Anne Arundel Co. Lost Towns Project has taken the lead in excavating and
 publishing, and the Saint Marys City Commission and the Jefferson Patterson Park and
 Museum, the location of Maryland's Archaeological Conservation Laboratory, have spon
 sored important excavations on Maryland's western shore. This wave of new research has
 resulted in an explosion of so-called gray literature, reports produced for project clients
 and funding organizations but circulated in limited numbers in print or, increasingly,
 electronically. The organization of data for dissemination via the Internet was pioneered
 by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, sponsor of the Digital Archaeological Archive of
 Comparative Slavery, whose Web site supplies links to seventeenth-century sites once
 occupied by enslaved Africans (http://www.daacs.org). The Comparative Archaeological
 Study of Colonial Chesapeake Culture is a consortium of researchers from a number of
 regional institutions, hosted by Colonial Williamsburg. The project's Web site reports
 project goals, data, and results (http://www.chesapeakearchaeology.org).
