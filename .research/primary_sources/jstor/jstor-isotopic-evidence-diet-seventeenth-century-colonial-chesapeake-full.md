 ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FOR DIET IN THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY
 COLONIAL CHESAPEAKE

 Douglas H. Ubelaker and Douglas W. Owsley

 Excavations of colonial period sites in Maryland and Virginia have produced human remains dating to the seventeenth cen-

 tury. In this study, we analyze stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from these remains to explore aspects of the diets of the

 individuals represented. Analyses of both stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were conducted on preserved protein while sta-
 ble carbon isotope analysis was also conducted on preserved biological apatite. Carbon isotope values (613C%o) rangedfrom
 -10.5 to -20.5 for collagen and -5.1 to -12.5for bioapatite. Nitrogen isotope values (6'5N%o) ranged from 9.9 to 14.4. The data

 suggest dietary diversity among the individuals examined. Three factors contribute to this diversity: the availability of maize,

 variation in immigration histories of the individuals, and the differing lengths of time they spent in the American colonies.

 the 19 individuals excavated from the Patuxent Point

 Site (18CV271). This site, dated between 1658 and
 the mid-to-late 1680s, is located near Solomons,

 Bone samples were also analyzed from 11 indi-

 Rivers in Virginia: 10 from Jamestown Island and
 one from Chischiak Watch (44YO466) near York-

 town (Owsley 1999a, 1999b; Owsley and Bruwel-
 heide 1997; Owsley et al. 1997; Verano and Owsley

 these remains date between 1609 and 1675 (Cotter

 lack comprehensive coverage of all groups in dif-

 fering economic and social strata (Carr et al. 1991).
 Then, too, archeological studies of recovered faunal

 Collagen from consumers of C4 plants can produce
 carbon values as high as -6%o. Values from con-

 -15%o (Katzenberg 1992, 2000; Schoeninger et al.
 1983; Ubelaker et al. 1995).

 In addition to the information derived from col-

 lagen, data on carbon isotope ratios also can be
 gleaned from analysis of the bioapatite in bone min-

 shift in C4 consumption after arrival in the Chesa-

 be detected through isotope analysis. For example,
 carbon isotope values of northwest Europeans are
 centered around -18 to -21%o due to the lack of nat-

 ural C4 terrestrial vegetation (Katzenberg 1991;
 Kennedy 1989; Mays 1997; Schoeninger 1989). Val-

 ues of carbon isotopes derived from collagen among

 maize agriculturalists in the New World are typically

 greater than -10%o (Schoeninger et al. 1983).

 Carbon isotope values derived from Late Wood-

 are not quite that positive, but clearly reflect subsis-
 tence economies based on horticulture, combined

 with gathering and the hunting of deer and small
 game (Hantman 2001; Trimble and Macko 1994).
 Maize continued to be an important food, as well as

 an item of trade, during the post-1607 era.

 Although bone isotope values may reflect factors

 on marine foods and dietary components other than

 maize (e.g., Buikstra and Milner 1991; Larsen et al.
 1992; Walker and DeNiro 1986). For example, stud-

 ies of coastal and inland aboriginal groups in British
 Columbia that lacked maize detected carbon colla-

 gen values ranging between -13%o in those depen-
 dant on marine resources to -20%0 in those

 consuming terrestrial foods. Bourque and Krueger
 (1994) have used isotopic evidence to assess the
 extent of marine foods in the diet in samples from
 coastal New England.

 Working with samples from the Georgia coast,
 Larsen et al. (1992) documented a temporal trend

 extending through the prehistoric-historic periods of

 a dietary shift in favor of maize at the expense of
 marine sources.

 In similar fashion, isotopic analyses of human
 remains from Europe have been used to study the
 relative importance of marine resources in ancient

 diets (Mays 1997). Although maize was not present

 of dietary factors, with some variables being partic-
