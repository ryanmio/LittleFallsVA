 dents, the high school group learned a
 good deal of field technique and gained
 a better understanding of the archaeolog-
 ical conservation ethic. On the other
 hand, the Park Service was able to stretch
 its limited survey dollars much farther
 thanks to their voluntary assistance.

 Unlike the rugged conditions of so
 many archaeological sites, City Point is
 a place of outstanding natural beauty.
 Appomattox Manor, the Eppes family
 residence until it was acquired by the
 Park Service, stands on the bluff over-
 looking the river. Richard Eppes built
 this house in 1763, as indicated by a
 chimney brick inscribed with his initials
 and that date. Family tradition, how-
 ever, held that an earlier dwelling had
 stood on this site. The nineteenth-cen-
 tury owner, also named Richard Eppes,
 wrote in his 1858 diary, "On coming in
 possession of the City Point estate my
 grandfather removed from Eppes Island
 and settled at City Point. He pulled
 down the old mansion and erected the
 one we now live in..." Mrs. Cutchin
 mentioned that artifacts were turned up
 in the backyard during the landscaping
 in the 1930s. Otherwise the site of the
 earlier house was unknown.

 The first step in locating the old
 house, as well as other possible struc-
 tures, was a remote sensing survey of
 the Point. Bruce Bevan of Geosight,

 Uncovering Early Colonial

 City Point, Virginia
 by David G. Orr,
 Douglas Campana
 and Brooke S. Blades

 At the confluence of the James and
 Appomattox rivers, the jut of land called
 City Point, Virginia has drawn atten-
 tion for millennia. Recently it has be-
 come the subject of study by National
 Park Service archaeologists, with the
 aid of a crew of college students and
 high school volunteers. Ideally suited
 to command communications on the

 river, City Point was first settled in pre-
 historic times. In 1607 Christopher New-
 port explored the James River, and he
 and John Smith spent several days at
 the Appomattox Indian settlement on
 the opposite shore. Newport made note
 of the Point, and shortly thereafter the
 first European settlers arrived. A land
 patent for City Point was granted in
 1635 to Francis Eppes, who established
 a plantation there.

 With the exception of a brief displace-
 ment during the Civil War, City Point
 remained in the possession of the Eppes
 family until 1978, when the property was
 sold to the National Park Service. This
 impressive tenure constitutes one of the
 longest ownerships by a single family
 in America.

 occupation on the Point and the subse-
 quent changes since the Civil War era.
 For seven weeks during the summer

 of 1983 a team under the direction of
 author David G. Orr, Mid-Atlantic Re-
 gional Archaeologist, and assisted by
 authors Brooke Blades and Douglas
 Campana, tested the area for prehistoric
 and historic remains. Augmenting the
 regular Park staff were eight college and
 graduate students from around the coun-
 try who were hired as summer tempo-
 rary assistants.

 The excavation was highlighted by a
 two and one-half week period when a
 group of 15 high school volunteers from
 Lower Merion High School, Ardmore,
 Pennsylvania, joined the crew. During
 this time the students were given hands-
 on experience in archaeological field
 methods while helping the Park Service
 to achieve its survey goals. Their teacher,
 Steven McCarter, coordinated the stu-
 dents' activities and the National Park
 Service staff provided daily instruction
 and evening lectures.

 Punctuating the volunteers' work in

 the trenches were demonstrations of re-
 mote sensing technology, talks on Civil
 War history and life in the ante-bellum
 South, and a lively discussion with Elise
 Eppes Cutchin about her remembrances
 of life at City Point during the early
 twentieth century. Both the students
 and the Park Service profited greatly
 from this interchange. Working in close
 association with the team of professional

 During the Civil War Siege of Peters-
 burg, City Point's strategic position led
 to its being chosen by Ulysses S. Grant
 as his headquarters. The Point became
 a telegraphic communication post and
 one of the busiest military supply de-
 pots in the Civil War. Today this epi-
 sode is a major theme of the National
 Park Service's interpretive program. Pre-
 vious archaeological work had identified
 the site of General Grant's headquar-
 ters cabin, which has now been replaced
 on its original location. The original
 cabin had stood in Fairmount Park,
 Philadelphia, since 1865, the year it was
 moved from City Point. The cabin was
 a gift from General Grant to George
 Stuart, a prominent Philadelphian and
 head of the Sanitary Commission dur-
 ing the Civil War.

 The soil at City Point holds the ar-
 chaeological record of people and events
 for the entire time span from prehistory
 to the present. In 1983 the National
 Park Service initiated an archaeological
 survey to inventory these resources and
 to determine their extent. One question
 to be answered was the degree and na-
 ture of the occupation during prehistoric
 times. Other objectives were to deter-
 mine the earliest period of historical

 dwelling and domestic trash. Although
 Richard Eppes deposited the cellar fill
 and artifacts ca. 1763, the domestic
 items- many already broken - were
 probably left on the site by the former
 occupants.

 Little is known of these individuals,
 but glass bottle seals provide clues.
 Prominent landowners in colonial Vir-
 ginia often decanted wine into bottles
 bearing a family name or initials. Two
 seals were marked "PT 1742"- the orig-
 inal owner is as yet unknown. Another
 seal, however, bore the initials "FE"
 which strengthens the scant historical
 data that suggest a Francis Eppes oc-
 cupied the Point during the decade prior
 to his death in 1737.

 The artifacts within the cellar refuse

 deposit- fragments of glass bottles and
 ceramic vessels, brass buttons, buckles,
 pins, lead musket shot, and an iron fish
 hook- all dated no later than ca. 1760.
 The ceramic component reveals a lower
 percentage of coarse utilitarian earth-
 enwares than of English tin-glazed
 earthenware punch bowls, tea wares of
 English white salt-glazed stoneware, tin-
 glazed earthenware and Chinese porce-
 lain. The consumption of punch and tea
 suggested by these vessel fragments re-
 flects two of the most status-related ac-
 tivities among Chesapeake Tidewater
 society.

 Indeed, other aspects of the material
 record indicate that the City Point plan-
 tation represented a substantial step to-
 ward fulfilling the domestic and social
 aspirations shared by many planters in
 the Tidewater. A house measuring 30
 by 18 feet may not seem spacious by
 modern standards, but it must be re-
 membered that architectural form
 served to delineate sharply only the very
 rich and the very poor in early eigh-
 teenth-century Virginia. Planters of
 varying economic and social levels be-
 tween these extremes resided in houses
 of similar appearance. The dwelling at
 City Point was probably the focal point
 for various support outbuildings, as
 well as connecting fences, gardens and
 orchards. Definition of these features
 and the patterns of activities around
 the plantation dwelling awaits further
 excavation.

 The prehistoric occupation
 All the prehistoric trenches- ranging
 in size from three feet to six by nine
 feet- yielded hundreds of quartzite
 chips and cores and aboriginal pottery,
 with an occasional projectile point. Most
 belonged to the Middle Woodland pe-
 riod (300 B.c. to A.D. 700), but the pot-
 tery evidence indicated that aboriginal
 occupation may have continued on City
 Point until the arrival of the European
 settlers. Numerous Archaic points were
 also found, some dating back to earlier
 than 6500 b.c., but none of these were

 paratus and a magnetometer to locate
 and map any sub-surface anomalies. Un-
 like all other radars the signal from a
 ground-penetrating radar is beamed into
 the soil, rather than into the air. The
 radar signal is simply a series of very
 short pulses. When any of these pulses
 meets an abrupt change in the earth,
 part of the signal is reflected back to
 the radar. Anomalies can result from
 buried brick or metal, or from marked
 changes in the soil strata. Utilizing this
 method, Bevan found a large, nearly rec-
 tangular area north of the present manor.
 A similar survey had been conducted
 a few years earlier at Petersburg Na-
 tional Battlefield. An anomaly found
 there, much like the City Point ex-
 ample, proved to be a buried house
 cellar when excavated. It seemed highly
 probable, therefore, that the radar had
 located the site of the earlier Eppes
 house. An initial test trench sited at
 one corner of the anomaly confirmed our
 suspicion.

 Limited site testing had been con-
 ducted at City Point in 1979, which
 suggested that it was the site of exten-
 sive aboriginal occupation. It was de-
 sirable, therefore, to trace the extent and
 integrity of the prehistoric remains. A
 regularly spaced array of small test
 squares, independent of the radar sur-
 vey, was laid out over the area. As the
 Park Service's archaeological philoso-
 phy is oriented toward preservation
 rather than research, this procedure per-
 mitted the archaeologists to ascertain
 the nature of the site, while preserving
 intact ás much as possible.

 Because both historic and prehistoric
 components were involved, the crew was
 broken down into historic and prehis-
 toric teams, although their functions
 often overlapped. The temporarily-hired
 archaeologists had been trained prima-
 rily in either American prehistory or
 American historical archaeology, but

 most had experience in both.

 So that they might gain as wide an

 experience as possible, the high school
 students were rotated from one group
 to the next on a regular basis. During
 the course of the program each gradu-
 ate student was assigned two assist-
 ants, who helped with the troweling,
 screening, extensive note-keeping, and
 making sectional diagrams and plans.
 On rainy days the entire crew moved
 indoors to wash and number the exca-
 vated artifacts.

 Excavation results

 The newly-discovered dwelling site re-

 veals that the structure had measured
 30 by 18 feet, and had stood one and
 one-half stories in height in its final
 form. A cellar lay beneath the dwelling
 and a chimney projected from each gable
 end. Although the chimney had also
 stood upon brick foundations, the pres-
 ence of straw-impressed clay daub within
 the northeast corner of the cellar revealed
 that at least the north chimney was
 timber-framed and covered with daub.
 Architectural fragments from the cellar
 indicated that the dwelling occupants
 benefited from the presence of leaded
 casement windows and interior walls
 covered with whitewashed plaster. The
 frame walls of the structure had rested
 upon brick foundations which appear to
 have been added in the second quarter
 of the eighteenth century; the nature of
 the earlier wall underpinning is unclear.
 The dwelling was probably constructed
 in the late seventeenth century, but
 associated artifacts suggest that Euro-
 pean occupancy may have begun as
 early as 1650.

 Archaeologists removed approxi-
 mately one-sixth of the cellar fill. The
 earliest layers contained a scattering of
 objects reflecting occupation from the
 late seventeenth to the mid-eighteenth
 century. The overlying cellar fill con-
 sisted of destruction debris from the

 Medieval Islamic Medicine: Ibn
 Ridwan's TVeatise "On the Pre-

 Late in the tenth century, a Tunisian
 doctor, Ibn al-Jazzãr, wrote at length on
 the causes, prevention and treatment of
 epidemics. In passing, he reiterated a
 long-standing complaint among foreign-
 ers that Egypt was a particularly un-
 healthy place. This claim stimulated a
 sharp response from the Islamic physi-
 cian, Ali Ibn Riçlwãn (a.D. 998-1068), in
 a treatise entitled "On the Prevention of
 Bodily Ills in Egypt." Ibn Riçlwãn did
 not shrug off the profound effects of the
 several bouts of pestilence and famine
 that struck Cairo and al-Fustãt in his
 own lifetime, but he asserted that suc-
 cessful patient treatment called for an
 understanding of the unique tempera-
 ment of Egypt and its people.

 A translation of Ibn Riçlwân's treatise

 is the backbone of Medieval Islamic
 Science. The emphasis is on preventive
 ( versus curative ) medicine and the treat-
 ment of the individual over the disease.
 It demonstrates how well Arab physi-
 cians absorbed the naturalistic views of
 health prescribed by Hippocrates and
 the humoral pathology of Galen into
 their everyday practice, while offering
 fascinating glimpses into the colorful na-
 ture of Islamic culture as a whole.  Stuart

 Ethics and Values in Archaeol-
 ogy, edited by Ernestine L. Green.
 xii, 301 pages, bibliography. The Free
 Press , New York, NY 1984 $34.95

 Much ol the world today thinks that
 the work of Indiana Jones is archaeol-
 ogy, yet even his professorial persona
 has certainly never pondered the issues
 raised in this book. Real archaeologists,

 however, are struggling to define both
 their professional roles and their respon-
 sibilities to society present and future.
 With the publication of this important
 volume, the discussions come out from
 behind the closed doors of professional
 meetings and specialized journals.

 The twenty-five contributors to Eth-

 ics and Values in Archaeology were
 among the first to ask the hard ques-
 tions, and their essays make it clear that
 the years of debate have produced no
 easy answers. At the same time, out-
 side forces - such as government reg-
 ulation, private and public funding,
 assertion of rights by native groups-
 increasingly affect archaeology and
 make clear-cut solutions even more elu-
 sive. Are there situations in which an
 archaeologist should not excavate? How
 does politics affect research in foreign
 countries? Do the demands of science
 justify desecration of burials? Can any-
 thing break the vicious economic cycle
 that causes looting? The book explores
 these and many other issues that de-
 mand the attention of all archaeologists
 and serious students. Even casual read-

 ers will find some chapters here that cap-
 ture their interest and provoke new ways
 of thinking about the purpose of archae-
 ology.  Ellen Herscher,  American Asso-
 ciation of Museums, Washington, u. C.

 in place. The majority, in fact, came from
 the excavation of the cellar of the earlier
 dwelling, most probably from the soil
 removed in digging the foundation of
 the Manor nearby. This soil was likely
 used to fill the cellar of the demolished
 house.

 Following the excavation, the prehis-

 toric material has been catalogued and
 analyzed by summer staff members Jane
 Erskine and Tracy Millis at Virginia
 Commonwealth University, under the di-
 rection of Daniel Mouer. Among their
 discoveries has been the identification
 of a previously unrecognized Late Wood-
 land pottery type. The objects have been
 photographed and drawn, and their
 work will form a portion of the City
 Point site report to be published by the
 National Park Service.

 Both the historic and prehistoric as-
 pects of the survey proved very suc-
 cessful, and the high school intern
 program was particularly effective. The
 1983 season was the third year of the
 intern program, and each season has
 been more successful than the last. This
 program, now in its fifth year, will be
 focused on Valley Forge National His-
 toric Park this coming summer. The
 Lower Merion students will be assisting
 the Park Service in archaeological tests
 designed to ascertain the location of a
 possible Revolutionary War redoubt. It
 is hoped that a new and perhaps more
 ambitious program can be undertaken
 in the future. □
