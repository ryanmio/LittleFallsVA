THE SEED FROM WHICH VIRGINIA GREW

An Address Delivered by Mr. George Arents at the Charter Day
Convocation, February 8, 1939, in Phi Beta Kappa Hall

Shortly after your President asked me to address you, he
sent me a copy of the Charter of the College, dated 1693. Two
things in it struck me particularly. The first related to the of-
ficers of the College and in it occurs the statement that "one
eminent and discreet person" shall be elected as Chancellor. No
mention is made of the qualifications of the President, but were
that Charter to be written today, it would say that, in addition to
being "eminent and discreet," the President must be a person of
great understanding and knowledge, sympathetic to the problems
of young people, a man of vision and tolerance. Who then, would
be better qualified to fill these requirements than your President-
John Stewart Bryan!

When Mr. Bryan asked me to talk to you, and suggested as a
subject- the place tobacco has held in Virginia- he probably did
so because he knew that I had devoted many years to forming a
library about tobacco.

You may be interested to know why I formed this collection.
Many members of my family lived in Richmond. My great
uncle, Lewis Ginter, was a manufacturer of tobacco there. As
a boy, I frequently visited Richmond and felt it was my second

home. On one of my many visits, Major Ginter gave me some
advice which I have never forgotten.
It has added greatly to
my happiness, and I think, may be of value to many of you here.
He said, '"When you are young, have many hobbies, but let your
business or profession come first. As you grow older you will
have to abandon some of them, the more you have the less you
will miss those you must give up."

I took his advice and became a hobbyist. His prediction was
true, for I did have to give up some of my pet interests, but one
hobby that I began then, I have never abandoned. What could be
more natural for me, with the background of tobacco in my family,

seventeen when I started this collection ; I am now sixty-three. So
for nearly half a century I have been adding books and manuscripts
to this library.

In order to understand clearly this story, we have to go back
a few centuries. Columbus was the first European to see the plant.
He records in his Journal the fact, that on October 15th, 1492, an
Indian in a canoe offered him some dried leaves. About a month
later, two of his sailors, exploring Cuba or Haiti, first saw natives
smoking. The Spaniards who settled in the West Indies, adopted
the habit of puffing a cigar.
Sailors, upon returning to Spain,
introduced the custom of smoking and thus a demand for tobacco
spread in the mother country. Tobacco, indeed, was to become
the most generous gift of the New World to the Old.
It was to
bring great happiness to many people and eventually prove to be of
more value then all the gold found in the Americas.

The small native plantations in the Spanish colonies soon be-
came insufficient to meet the growing demand for tobacco. Before
1535, therefore, Spanish planters transferred the seeds of the cul-
tivated variety growing in Yucatan to Santo Domingo.
They
quickly learned the correct method of cultivation and became
expert in developing seed-beds, transplanting, and removing the
suckers. Through various experiments, they eventually developed
a beautiful, fragrant leaf, and by 1575 or thereabouts, the Spaniards
were in practical control of the rapidly growing European market.
When I tell you that Spanish tobacco in London at the end of the
Sixteenth Century brought from 35 shillings to 4 pounds 10 shil-
lings the pound, which is equivalent in purchasing power, to from
$50. to $125. today, you will understand not only how expensive but
how desirable this kind was. These high prices were due to ex-
cessive duties ; spoilage in transit, which left only a small quantity
to sell ; and many exorbitant charges which I will not go into here.
As you will remember, there was an English colony at Roanoke
Island. This was abandoned in 1586, at which time Drake brought

the impoverished settlers back. There were two kinds of tobacco
in Drake's cargo : the Spanish which he had seized in raids in the
West Indies, and the "Virginian," which Ralph Lane had brought
back for Raleigh. Raleigh was one of the few Englishmen who
liked this "Virginian" tobacco- practically no one else would,
or could, smoke it. When the English colonists began their
second settlement, this time at Jamestown, they continued the habit
of smoking, which they had acquired at home, but the tobacco they

technical, but I must say this- botanists call the native tobacco of
Virginia, Nicotiana rustica, while that grown by the Spaniards was
called Nicotiana Tabacum. You will understand me when I say
that the same difference in taste exists between these two species,
as between a crab apple and an Albemarle pippin.
Indeed the first
recorder of "Virginia," William Strachey, wrote of it : "It is not of
the best kind, it is poor and weak and of a biting taste, growing
not fully a yard above the ground ..."
and other similar comments
occur in the literature of the period. On the other hand there was
nothing but words of praise for the Spanish leaf. Although the
colonists were aware of the profitable market for tobacco in Eng-
land and on the Continent, the struggle for existence in their new
home delayed any commercial cultivation of the plant in Virginia
for three years. When they finally sent their first shipment over,
the factors in London would have little or none of this bitter
tobacco and it remained a drug on the market. The colony was

experiment which was
tremendous indeed, that it was responsible for the salvation of
the colony. That man was John Rolfe. He knew that the Vir-
ginians could never hope to compete with the Spaniards if they
continued to grow the bitter tobacco native to Virginia. About
1611, he persuaded a shipmaster to bring back with him some seeds
of the tobacco grown on the Island of Trinidad, then famous for
the quality of its leaf, and also some seeds from Caracas (Vene-

fied, and the first experimental shipment went to England. Think
of the prayers and hopes that went with that shipment; the fears
of Rolfe and the colonists, when a ship from England finally re-
turned ! And then the good news : the new Virginia tobacco was so
good that at first the London merchants thought they were being

In an effort to correct this intensive concentration on one com-
modity and to diversify their agriculture, various laws came into
existence, so that at one time only nine leaves were permitted to
remain on a plant and each colonist permitted only a thousand
plants. These orders were rescinded and replaced by others, so
that in 1629, we find the crop of each individual limited to three
thousand plants, and these restrictive measures continued through
a large part of the early colonial period.

degree that it controlled its economic existence. Thus we find that

Everything at that time could be paid for in tobacco, including the
wages of soldiers and the salaries of ministers. After the colony
was well established the ministers received sixteen thousand pounds
a year, with deductions for sorting, casking, and so forth. The
parishes where the tobacco crops were distinguished for quality
were naturally preferred by the clergy. There were more marri-
ages to be performed in such communities. Two hundred pounds
of tobacco was the fee fixed by law for a marriage service, twice
that amount for a funeral sermon- I do not know what was the

- Amen! And that the military officer thought it no way dis-
honourable to his profession to draw his pay in this specific article
of traffic." As a matter of fact, when the crop failed in 1758, the
Assembly ordered that ministers be paid in money instead of
tobacco. The clergy remonstrated against this and sent an agent
over to England, whereupon the law was repealed.

During this period, there were various export taxes on tobacco
shipped from Virginia and Maryland. From 1673 a tax of a penny
a pound was assessed on all tobacco shipped, with the exception
of that going to England. Your Charter contains a provision
that from 1693 this penny the pound was to be paid to the trustees
of the newly-founded College of William and Mary to be used
for "building and adorning the edifices and other necessaries for
the said college." But King William was Dutch- a thrifty race-
and a clause in this Charter provided that, while the penny the
pound was to go to the college, it was not to get the whole penny,

the tax on tobacco was one of the earliest sources of income for
this great college.

As may well be imagined, the continuous concentration upon
tobacco brought about over-production with its consequent miseries.

too much plenty would make gold itself a drug. Our thriving is
our undoing, and our purchase of negroes, by increasing the supply
of tobacco, has greatly contributed thereto."

At least, driven to despair, the more aggressive planters in
several counties proceeded to trample down their own growing
crops and then destroyed those of their neighbors who had refused
to join them. A considerable quantity was destroyed before the
militia put down the "cutting riots," and in 1684, the Assembly
made the act of destroying tobacco a treasonable offence punishable
by death.

Virginia was peculiarly sensitive to the economic conditions
in Europe. When, for instance, the prohibitions against smoking
in Russia were rescinded, the trade in Virginia tobacco was helped
considerably because of the shipments made to Russia via London.

how closely Virginia was linked with Europe through its staple
trade. The fact that in the European wars of the Austrian suc-
cession (1740-48) and the Seven Years' War (1756-63) England
and France, though belligerents,
informally arranged to exempt
the vessels freighted with tobacco from seizure, will also indicate
the great importance of this commodity to all European nations.
France was a large purchaser of Virginia tobacco, and it became a

and Deane had arranged with the French tobacco monopolists for
the purchase of two million livres' worth of tobacco (five million
pounds). A million livres was advanced to Franklin to be used
in the purchase of material and to establish credits for the American
cause.

From the very inception of tobacco cultivation in Virginia,
the concentration upon this commodity had some far-reaching
social, economic and political consequences. As there were no

the English Merchant Marine, which, when later supported by the
Navigation Acts, became the most powerful in Europe. Owing to
lack of proper fertilizers, the small Virginia planter became an
agricultural spendthrift. For many generations he followed the
old one-crop system which soon rendered his plantation sterile.
But by the mere process of clearing timber the settler was able
to move to the west, the south and the southwest. Thus, the exten-
sion of English boundaries in this part of North America was to
a degree dictated by the general occupation of tobacco growing.
But in tidewater Virginia, estates of five thousand to thirty-seven
thousand acres existed. Therefore, there was a large and scattered
settler class and a series of great self-sustaining estates.
It was
the nature of Virginian agriculture which determined that it should
have a representative type of government rather than the form
familiar in New England colonies, where everybody gathered
around a central meeting house.

of the bypaths of history in order to tell you the story of "The Seed

begins to curl, remember this story and say a benediction for the
man who should be called the patron saint of tobacco- John Rolfe
