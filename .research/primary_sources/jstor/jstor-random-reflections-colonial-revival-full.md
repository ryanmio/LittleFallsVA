 RANDOM REFLECTIONS ON lTHE COLONIAL REVIVAL

 Wayne Andrews

 Although the colonial style is as respectable in 1964

 as a draft on the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company,
 this was not always the case. Wayne Andrews reminds
 us that there were Americans in the nineteenth cen-

 tury who had no respect for the achievements of our
 colonial builders and architects. The revival of interest

 -the acceptance of the idea that it might be interest-
 ing to live in a house inspired by the work of our
 colonial craftsmen-was due to the earnest endeavors

 of a number of men, some wise, some silly. This is not
 surprising; no change in taste comes about without
 the encouragement of fanatics.

 The colonial revival-like all other revivals-cannot

 be written off as a mere matter of building replicas.
 In all the eclectic revivals a certain freedom was en-

 joyed by the greater architects in their greater works.
 The author points out that McKim, Mead & White,
 who may be said to have launched the colonial revival
 in 1886, can not be accused of being copycats.

 To Edith Wharton no readers were more imperti-
 nent than those who inquired what incidents in "real
 life" she recalled in her fiction. "All novelists who

 describe (whether from within or without) what is
 called society life are pursued," she complained, in her
 autobiography, "by the exasperating accusation of put-
 ting flesh-and-blood people into their books. Anyone
 gifted with the least creative faculty knows the absurd-
 ity of such a charge. Real people transported into a
 work of the imagination would instantly cease to be
 real; only those born of the creator's brain can give
 the least illusion of reality."

 Any architect who claimed to be an artist, if sum-
 moned to define what he remembered before ap-
 proaching the drafting board, would have to respond
 as vehemently as Mrs. Wharton. As scholars of the vari-

 ous revivals in American architecture are beginning to
 understand, the old accusation that our great eclectic
 monuments may be traced one after another to this or
 that drawing or photograph, is nothing short of non-
 sense. A genius may borrow, but he cannot steal. Now
 that modern architecture is firmly established, there
 is no longer any point in repeating the tiresome argu-
 ments of the naive champions of originality.

 Yet it is entertaining and even rewarding to try to
 guess what images flash through an architect's mind
 before the first sketch is formed. And since the firm of

 McKim, Mead & White is commonly credited with in-
 troducing the colonial revival to America, it might be

 worthwhile to examine for a moment the type of in-
 spiration to which the partners were subject. It might
 even be wise to glance at a typical building in the
 shingle style for which McKim, Mead & White were
 famous in the early 1880's. Consider, for instance, the
 residence of C. J. Osborn at Mamaroneck, New York,
 dating from 1885. What may have suggested the Osborn
 house and others in this style is the Manoir d'Ango at
 Varengeville in Normandy, dating from 1530-1545,
 which White and McKim may have inspected on their
 tour of France with Saint-Gaudens in 1878. The tower

 in the courtyard of the Manoir was never literally
 copied, but the hoods over the windows may have
 prompted similar hoods in the Osborn house, just as
 the polychromy of the brickwork may have fired
 White's decorative instincts. In any event an unpreju-
 diced observer would have to admit that the partners
 had made a singularly free translation of the original.
 And this is precisely the manner in which they were
 to handle the colonial revival.

 American Review for April 1844, "that if we look about
 us for anything correct and pleasing, we do not find it so
 much in the work of our own time as in those which
 were executed sixty or eighty years ago." Gilman
 found that he could praise Christ Church in Cam-
 bridge and King's Chapel in Boston. These we now
 know to be the work of Peter Harrison.

 But in the 1840's a colonial revival was far in the

 distance. And it was equally inconceivable in 1869,
 when Richard Upjohn, the architect of Trinity, New
 York, the greatest of all our Gothic revival churches,
 addressed the third annual convention of the American

 Institute of Architects. His colleagues may have been
 surprised, but this Gothicist had a kind word to say
 about what was accomplished before American inde-
 pendence. "An investigation of the buildings of the
 colonial period," he reminded his audience, "may
 show us what foundations we had to start upon, and
 will call up serious reflections as to whether or not we
 have made those improvements upon the works of our
 predecessors which the general progress of knowledge
 throughout the world seems to have demanded."

 Upjohn, and he spoke with real authority, felt that

 "the ecclesiastical architecture of the ante-Revolution-

 ary days was, in almost every instance, far superior to
 that of the period subsequent to the Revolution. Then
 every trace of refinement, of truthful expression and
 fitness of purpose was lost sight of. Not a vestige of
 sacred thought can be discovered in the houses of wor-
 ship of this period."

 So much for the meeting houses designed early in
 the century by Bulfinch. Upjohn went on. "May we
 not gain a valuable lesson while contemplating these
 works of our forefathers? Old and quaint as they are,
 will we not see by comparing them with the works of
 our own hands that their authors regarded the law of
 harmony between a building and its surroundings bet-
 ter than we do?"

 Seven years later when Richard Morris Hunt ad-
 dressed another convention of the AIA, there was still
 no sign of a colonial revival. In his review of the Phila-
 delphia Centennial, Hunt singled out the exhibits of
 Massachusetts and Connecticut as being "in the style
 of the old colonial buildings of New England," but it
 is evident that this prominent architect knew not of
 what he spoke. Massachusetts had put up a belated
 example of a Gothic villa with an Italian tower; Con-
 necticut was equally under the influence of the roman-
 tic revivals.

 There were stirrings, however. In 1879 the Rhode
 Island chapter of the AIA offered a prize for the best
 set of drawings of the colonial remains in that state.
 No one chose to enter the competition, but by 1881
 George C. Mason was praying "humbly and earnestly"
 in the pages of the American Architect and Building
 News that "we may brush away the dust and mystery"
 surrounding our pre-Revolutionary architecture. The

 But first a word about the ancestry of this style.
 Like all other revivals, the colonial owes much to the

 arguments of earnest men, and it was not introduced
 without controversy. Thomas Jefferson damned the
 achievements of our colonial architects in his Notes

 on Virginia; there were many critics in the years to
 come who shared his bias. A certain Louisa C. Tut-

 hill, who bravely published in Philadelphia in 1848
 a history of architecture from the earliest times to
 "its present condition in Europe and the United
 States," decided that the meeting houses of colonial
 New England "though truly grateful and even beauti-
 ful to the eye of piety" were "outrageous deformities to
 the eye of taste." She noted that "court houses and
 academies were built in the same uncouth style. Hap-
 pily," she continued, "they were all of such perishable
 materials that they will not much longer remain to
 annoy travelers in search of the picturesque through
 the beautiful villages of New England."

 Mrs. Tuthill was writing in the heyday of the Greek,

 the Gothic, and the other revivals of the romantic

 period. Perhaps the first defender of the colonial tradi-
 tion was the Boston architect Arthur Delavan Gilman,

 who argued that "the introduction of Grecian archi-
 tecture among us has been a great mistake." Gilman
 was also bored by the work of Latrobe, Bulfinch, and
 the other leading figures of the federal period. The
 Capitol in Washington and the Boston State House
 were "flaunting and meretricious edifices," he con-
 cluded. "It is indeed a sad truth," he wrote in the North

 time had come, he wrote, to "delve among old papers,
 files and accounts . . . and thus elicit data which when

 brought together and well sifted will reward us with
 an insight into the causes which led to the adoption
 of forms of construction which we now admire."

 Mason, who had unearthed the contract for the

 Ayrault house at Newport, could not conceal his rever-
 ence for Richard Munday's Old Colony House.

 Mason was a gentle antiquarian. The first furious

 blast in favor of a colonial revival came from the

 caustic art critic Clarence Cook in September 1882.
 Writing in the North American Review, Cook made
 plain that an architect (Richard Morris Hunt) was
 responsible for the lavish residence of the W. K. Van-
 derbilts on Fifth Avenue. Were architects necessary?
 A glance at the Vanderbilt palace convinced the
 critic that they were an unmitigated evil.

 proved the partners had traveled widely and seen
 much. McKim was more than a restorer. Although
 intimately acquainted with our colonial architecture
 -he had, after all, carefully reconstituted the kitchen
 of the Thomas Robinson house in Newport in 1872,
 and approximately four years later remodeled yet
 another Newport interior, that of the Dennis house-
 he did not choose to be antiquarian. The huge chim-
 neys might have been inspired by a castle of the age
 of Francis I, and if the clapboarding was "colonial,"
 the front porch was too elegant to have been con-
 ceived before the federal period, and the frieze was
 far from being "colonial" in origin.

 "The general excellence that marks the dwellings
 of any people is a proof of the non-existence of pro-
 fessional architects among that people," Cook argued.
 "Did architects design the houses of Venice? Archi-
 tects may have designed the bad ones, but never the
 good ones. As soon as architects got themselves estab-
 lished in Venice, her shabby days began."

 All this was a little like Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
 celebrated essay of 1749 accusing the arts and sciences
 of depraving mankind, the very essay that prompted
 Voltaire to ask whether we should not begin to crawl
 once more on hands and legs. But publicity is an art
 with its own rules, and Cook's message reached an
 audience.

 "The most beautiful house," he proclaimed, "is not

 that on which art has most labored... but that which

 . . . shows itself fitted in its plan and by proportions
 for human occupation. That is why, in every land, the
 cottage attracts the eye more strongly than the palace;
 it expresses in simple form . . . the homely every-day
 needs and employment of its inhabitants. The kitchen,
 the wood-shed, the ironing-room are in plain sight;
 the bread oven swells from the wall as if it was the

 life-giving breast of the home."

 Architects might rage, but there were Americans
 who listened to Cook's homely words. He insisted that
 the cottages and small houses of the eighteenth cen-
 tury were the "best models for imitation or for sug-
 gestions."They were, he pointed out, "for a long time
 despised or neglected, while we, in our callow youth,
 were going through our classic mumps and gothic
 measles, and near to perishing with the dreadful visi-
 tation of the mansard malaria."

 Cook must have been disappointed by the H. A. C.
 Taylor house in Newport, the building which may be
 said to have inaugurated the colonial revival in 1886.
 First of all, it was designed by a firm of architects-
 McKim, Mead & White. Secondly, it was an imposing
 mansion rather than a cozy cottage. Thirdly, it was
 no copy of a colonial structure, but an invention that

 As McKim, Mead & White had learned the year
 before while designing the Villard Houses in New
 York City, the project that marked their return to the
 Renaissance for guidance after their original, informal
 achievements in the shingle style, the past might sug-
 gest much, but the past could not dictate to the nine-
 teenth century. A genuine re-creation was imperative.
 Possibly the most compelling colonial architecture in
 the back of the partners' mind while the H. A. C.
 Taylor house was being planned was the Thomas
 Thompson house at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
 This is something which McKim and White may have
 seen on their tour in 1877 of the New England coast.
 But the Thompson house is on a far more modest
 scale, and the question may be raised whether it is a
 "colonial" example in the first place, since it was
 supposedly built in 1789.

 In their other important "colonial" works McKim,
 Mead & White were so carefree as to infuriate anti-
 quarians. The James Breese house at Southampton,
 planned by White in 1906, is an admirable exhibit of
 their independence. The roof over the portico may
 have been prompted by a colonial farmhouse in New
 York or New Jersey, but no colonial gentleman, not
 even George Washington, could have dreamed of a
 frame house of such dignity and elegance.

 McKim, Mead & White may have had their faults,
 but they can not be blamed for the epidemic in our
 own time of "colonial" houses erected by aggressive
 builders. They were casual in their borrowings. They
 would doubtless have approved of Edith Wharton's
 denunciation of the style in The Decoration of Houses,
 published in 1897.

 In this book, written in collaboration with Ogden
 Codman, Mrs. Wharton not only made her first ap-
 pearance in hard covers, but made it most plain that
 she did not share the sentimentality of Clarence Cook.
 "The early American fireplace," she explained, "was
 merely a cheap provincial copy of English models of

 the same period. The application of the word colonial
 to pre-Revolutionary architecture and decoration has
 created a vague impression that there existed at that
 time an American architectural style. As a matter of
 fact, colonial architecture is simply a modest copy of
 Georgian models."

 Mrs. Wharton believed that our architects might
 turn to the eighteenth century for inspiration and
 might even remember, ever so faintly, an American
 example. But the word she preferred for such an effort
 was Georgian rather than colonial. Sketching the
 career of the young architect Dallas Archer at the
 very end of The Age of Innocence, she noted that
 Dallas's set "was protesting at the meangingless use
 of the word colonial. Nobody nowadays had colonial
 houses except the millionnaire grocers of the suburbs."

 A Backward Glance (copyright 1934, 1962) is repro-
 duced through the kind permission of Charles Scrib-
 ner's Sons, who are reissuing the book in 1964.
