 ing that Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, or George Wash-

 ington ever set foot in during the stirring events of the Revo-

 lution. It was, instead, a copy of an earlier building that had
 been erected under the direction of Governor Francis Nicholson

 between 1701 and 1705. This first building was destroyed by

 fire in 1747. After some debate as to whether the provincial

 capital should be moved from Williamsburg to a more central

 location further west, the General Assembly decided to remain

 in Williamsburg and rebuild the capitol.

 The old brick walls of the first capitol suffered little damage

 from the fire but were, nonetheless, taken down and completely

 rebuilt in 1751. The second capitol was reconstructed on top

 of the old foundations, the only major exterior changes being

 the squaring off of the southern apsidal walls and the construc-

 tion of a two-story portico on the west fa;ade, facing Duke of

 Gloucester Street (Fig. 2). This second building witnessed the

 dramatic events of the Revolution but was left to neglect after

 the capital moved west to Richmond in 1780. In 1832 the

 building suffered the same fate as the first one, falling victim

 to another fire, followed by demolition. In the mid-19th cen-

 tury, an academy was constructed on the capitol site but was

 pulled down by the time of the centennial celebration of Wash-

 ington's victory at Yorktown in 1881. The Association for the

 Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) acquired the prop-

 capitol was discovered at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, in De-

 cember 1929. This provided an added cache of detailed infor-

 mation concerning the placement and size of door and window

 openings, as well as the general character of the brickwork,

 central arcade, and cupola (Fig. 3).9 Given this solid base of

 evidence, the architects, led by the principal partner, Andrew

 H. Hepburn, reasoned that there would be less room for con-

 jecture by constructing this first building. They also felt that

 the H-shaped structure, with its apsidal ends, was inherently

 more interesting architecturally.10

 construction. Michel was an unreliable source: many of the features that
 he sketched directly contradict the much more accurate and skilled

 (Fig. 9).24

 Part of their reason for centering the door on the straight

 part of the long facade was based on their reading of the place-

 ment of window openings in several 19th-century views of the

 second capitol (Fig. 2). These illustrations of the capitol show

 a symmetrical facade with three windows on either side of a

 central pair of doors. Hepburn and his researchers believed that,

 when the building was rebuilt after the 1747 fire, the lower

 part of the walls of the first building were reused. The openings

 shown in these illustrations, they thought, indicated the exact

 position of the windows in the first building with the addition

 of a new window at the south end, where the apse had been

 pulled down and the wall squared (Fig. 7, IV).25 They also

 argued that the original position of the door, centered on the

 specifications called for a north-south arm in the center between the

 found it hard to explain why the original builders placed the cupola
 "off-center" once they had doubled the width of the arcade. They
 attributed the unfortunate result to the naivete of the colonial builders,

 who would have discovered the awkwardness only "after the cupola
 had been built on its new centre ... [and] the relation between the
 doorway in its first position and the cupola in its new position could
 be seen." It was the discovery of "this, and the growing importance of
 the Duke of Gloucester Street facade, [that] probably caused a recon-
 sideration of the door way [by the original builders] and eventually it
 was decided [by the original builders] to change the doorway to an axis

 the summer. In April Blair laid a foundation brick. On 24 June he noted

 that "they raised ye first Window on Capl Wall," which suggests that
 the builders had reached the first-floor level. Had the old walls been

 used, this would not have been necessary. In early October, the second

 floor began to go up. On 12 December the diarist noted that he "laid
 the last top brick on the capitol wall, and so it is now ready to receive
 the roof, and some of the wall plates were raisd and laid on this day."
 As a man who had seen the flow of provincial politics in Williamsburg,
 he observed that "I had laid a foundation brick at the first buildg of

 the capitol above 50 year ago, and another foundation brick in April

 above." Had the old walls been partially reused, the length of time

 formality was not evident in the archaeological record. In contradis-

 41. In their search for the architects responsible for the design of the
 public buildings in Williamsburg, the early architects of the Williams-
 burg Restoration found a strong piece of evidence to reinforce this

 notion. In 1724 Hugh Jones stated in The Present State of Virginia that

 the College of William and Mary was "first modelled by Sir Christopher
 Wren, adapted to the Nature of the Country by the Gentlemen there;
 and since it was burnt down, it has been rebuilt and nicely contrived,
 altered and adorned by the ingenious Direction of Govenor Spotswood;
 and is not altogether unlike Chelsea Hospital [designed by Wren]."
 Despite the clarity of Jones's statement, the meaning is fraught with
 ambiguities. Did Wren or someone in his Office of the King's Works
 supply the actual design drawings, or did his public buildings, such as
 Chelsea Hospital, serve as only a general guide for the "Gentlemen"

 of Virginia, who then altered the "model" to fit the needs of a fledgling
 institution and the abilities of the local building trades? H. Jones, The

 Present State of Virginia, London, 1724, 26. For a discussion of the validity
 of this early attribution, see Whiffen, Public Buildings, 28-32; J. D.

 William and Mary: Its History, Background, and Legacy, Williamsburg,

 the capitol, prototypes could be found in the work of Inigo

 Jones and Christopher Wren in London in the 17th century.51

 Colonel Yonge criticized such pretentious precedents as being

 out of context, arguing that "the embellishments of the large

 rooms of the old Capitol, as proposed by the architects, is [sic]
 not believed to accord with the then rural environment and the

 undeveloped condition of the country at large with its sparse

 population, still new country and almost a wilderness, or in

 keeping with the scant means available for any greater expen-

 diture than actually necessary."52

 In the end, the architects' persistence paid off. Colonel Yonge

 was unable to convert his fellow members on the APVA com-

 mittee to his point of view. Where argument failed, the fine

 quality of Perry, Shaw, & Hepburn's presentation drawings and

 scale model of the reconstructed capitol proved convincing.

 53. On 3 December 1930 the advisory committee met to discuss
 Perry, Shaw, & Hepburn's design of the capitol. E. G. Swem of the
 APVA presented his committee's views. Fiske Kimball, the most prom-
 inent and influential member of the Advisory Committee of Architects,

 supported the architects' position, believing firmly that the "main en-
 trance [in the west facade] should be centered on the square front." The
 advisory committee voted unanimously to accept the design. "Minutes
 of the Advisory Committee of Architects," 3 December 1930, CWFL.

 Pressure was also mounting on all sides to reach an agreement. Two
 years of research and analysis had delayed construction. With the dead-

 line for having the Capitol finished drawing near, many hoped to bring
 the discussion to a quick end. See, for example, Perry to Swem, 1 July
 1930, CWFA.

 54. Colonel Yonge reluctantly went along with the majority of the
 members of the APVA Capitol Committee. He submitted a minority
 report, however, in which he reiterated his views. Year Book of the
 Associationfor the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, 1931-1933, Rich-
 mond, 1934, 38-47. As work proceeded on the capitol in 1932, W.
 A. R. Goodwin began to have second thoughts about the APVA's ac-
 ceptance of the architects' design scheme. He reopened the question of
 the placement of the doors on the west facade and produced lengthy
 memos stating his argument for the position of the doors in the center
 of the entire building. With their plans well under way, the architects
 did not seriously reconsider the issue. With a growing sense of frus-
