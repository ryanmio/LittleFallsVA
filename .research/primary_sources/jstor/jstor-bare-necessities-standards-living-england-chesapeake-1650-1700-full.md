 "The Bare Necessities:"

 Standards of Living in England
 and the Chesapeake,
 1650-1700

 ABSTRACT

 The domestic environment had a profound influence on the
 texture of everyday life in early modern England and
 America not only in terms of family interaction but also as
 a tangible reflection of broader social attitudes towards
 hierarchy, status and consumerism. This article compares
 standards of living in England and the Chesapeake between
 1650 and 1700. Three regions are analyzed in detail: the
 Vale of Berkeley, Gloucestershire; St. Mary's County,
 Maryland; and part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. It is
 argued that a comparison of material culture and living
 standards reveals important aspects of the advantages and
 disadvantages of emigrating from England to the Chesa

 peake, and suggests significant differences between the two
 societies in this period.

 Introduction

 What were the gains and losses involved for the
 tens of thousands of men and women who left

 England in the 17th century to live "beyond the
 seas" in the Chesapeake colonies of Maryland and
 Virginia? Many factors influenced immigrants'
 adaptation to their new society: their own back
 grounds, the environment they encountered, the
 timing of their arrival, the ebb and flow of the
 tobacco economy, and plain luck. This paper
 investigates one aspect of adaptation through a
 comparison of standards of living reflected in the
 household inventories of selected communities in

 England and the Chesapeake. It will focus on items
 of material culture not normally recovered by
 archaeologists, but which were central in deter
 mining the quality of life experienced by settlers.
 Analysis of probate inventories not only provides a
 means of drawing broad comparisons of living

 standards across time and place (Shammas 1980,
 1982; Main 1982; Carr and Walsh 1985), but also

 suggests exciting possibilities for co-operation be
 tween historians and archaeologists engaged in the
 study of material culture in early America.

 Standards of living, as examined in this paper,
 relate to the dwellings and domestic furnishings of
 householders who have been divided into five

 wealth groups: less than ?10, ?10-?49, ?50-?99,
 ?100-?249, ?250 and over. Wealth is defined as
 the sum total of a decedent's moveable estate,
 including debts receivable: land is not included
 (Horn 1981; Main 1982; Carr and Walsh 1978,
 1985). No attempt is made to assess living stan
 dards using other criteria, for example, work
 patterns, health or recreational opportunities. This
 paper is concerned only with the domestic envi
 ronment. Dividing households of both societies
 into the same wealth categories raises problems
 about comparability. Does a person worth ?100 in
 England occupy roughly the same social position
 as a person worth the same amount in Maryland or
 Virginia? Are we comparing like with like? Ad
 justments have been made for differing exchange
 rates, as will be explained later, but the subjective
 problem of comparison remains. It was decided to
 adopt the same wealth groups for the English and
 Chesapeake data because using different categories
 would raise even greater problems of comparabil
 ity. Since these categories are approximations of
 social status, rather than precise definitions, dis
 tortions caused by this approach should not inval
 idate general conclusions.

 Three regions are analyzed in detail: the Vale of
 Berkeley, Gloucestershire; St. Mary's County,
 Maryland; and Lancaster and Northumberland
 counties, Virginia. Two characteristics of the Vale
 of Berkeley make it suitable for this analysis
 (Figure 1). First, the Vale is representative of one
 of the main types of community from which
 colonists emigrated, that is, a wood-pasture district
 in the southern half of England (Horn 1979;
 Salerno 1979). Conclusions drawn from an analy
 sis of living conditions in the Vale can be placed in
 the wider context of woodland parishes within
 Bristol's hinterland. Secondly, compared to other
 rural areas in England, the region provided large

 numbers of emigrants to the Chesapeake in the
 17th century; several hundred between 1619 and
 1690. The great majority of these were indentured
 servants who emigrated from Bristol during the
 second half of the century but there were also
 significant numbers of free emigrants who were
 connected to Bristol's mercantile community.

 Because there is insufficient evidence to link the

 geographical origins of English immigrants in
 particular Chesapeake communities, two regions
 with especially complete local records were chosen
 as representative of mainstream social and eco
 nomic developments along the tobacco coast
 (Figure 2). St. Mary's County, Maryland is one of
 the most intensely studied areas of the colonial
 Tidewater (St. Mary's City Commission). During
 the middle decades of the century, immigrants
 poured into the region from London, Bristol and
 other ports. Low to medium quality tobacco was
 produced locally and the county appears, on the

 dence, to have had close links with Bristol mer
 chants (Harris 1978; Miller 1983:83). Lancaster
 and Northumberland counties had closer ties with

 London merchants, but Bristol ships also traded
 along the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers. The
 region was a major receptor of immigrants in the
 1650s and 1660s and produced medium to high
 grade leaf (Morgan 1975:227-28). No claim is
 made that these areas represent the entire range of
 regional variation in the early Chesapeake. Vir
 ginia and Maryland historians are aware of signif
 icant differences in local economic and social

 structures. However, while it is important not to
 overlook local variation, there can be little doubt
 that society in St. Mary's County and in the

 Northern Neck had much in common with other

 major tobacco producing regions in terms of envi
 ronment, economic base and social development.

 Sources

 Probate inventories comprise the most important
 data source in this study. Four hundred and eighty
 inventories were analyzed for the Vale of Berke
 ley, 372 for St. Mary's County, and 150 for
 Lancaster and Northumberland. Using probate
 records in a comparative context poses a number of
 technical difficulties relating to provenience and
 consistency of data across the three inventoried
 populations. At best, only about 30 percent of all
 adult male decedents from the Vale, who died
 between 1660 and 1700, are represented by an
 inventory. Periodically the proportion is far lower,
 and there are also considerable fluctuations from

 one parish to another (Horn 1981). As far as
 English probate sources are concerned, there is
 nothing unusual about this. Most communities
 have only a fifth to a quarter of all decedents
 appearing in probate records. Poorer groups in
 early modern England are grossly underrepresen
 ted and hence most of the surviving evidence
 relates to middling and wealthy householders
 (Riden 1985:18).

 76 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 22

 In both societies the production of an inventory
 was an essential step in the process of proving a
 will or administration, and was designed to reduce
 the likelihood of embezzlement of the deceased's

 estate. Probate was supervised by the Church
 courts in England until the 19th century, and by
 secular county and prerogative courts in Maryland
 and Virginia (Main 1982:48-49).

 Although there are a good many similarities in

 the form of inventories in England and the Chesa
 peake, there are also some notable differences.
 The importance of bound labor in colonial society
 is reflected by the high levels of planter investment
 in servants and slaves, which in monetary value
 sometimes comprised the bulk of an estate. Sec
 ondly, whereas valuations in English inventories
 are always in pounds sterling, in Maryland and
 Virginia various currencies were used, the most
 common being tobacco. Comparison of the price
 of particular items is further complicated by dif
 ferent exchange rates which fluctuated throughout
 the colonial period. To control these variations, all
 valuations in tobacco have been converted to

 sterling equivalents using Russell R. Menard's
 data on tobacco prices throughout the 17th century
 (Menard 1975: 465-79). Inflation and fluctuations
 in exchange rates were adjusted using data sup
 plied by the St. Mary's City Commission. Wealth
 levels and values of individual items are standard

 ized to the English rate of exchange.

 land during the second half of the 17th century,
 possibly about 70 percent of the total decedent
 population (Menard 1976). People at all levels of
 society in Maryland appear to have been more
 assiduous than their English counterparts in having
 inventories drawn up for their kin, friends, or
 debtors (Carr and Walsh 1978). There are no
 reliable estimates for Virginia, but coverage ap
 pears closer to the English level than that of her
 sister colony.

 In both England and the Chesapeake, probate
 inventories followed a similar format: a list with
 valuations of the decedent's clothes, household

 possessions, livestock, crops or shopwares, and
 debts receivable. Apart from leasehold properties,
 real estate is rarely mentioned and was not required
 to be included (Horn 1981:82; Main 1975:89-99).

 Thirdly, Chesapeake inventories are frequently

 more detailed than English sources. It was custom
 ary in England for appraisers to value commodities
 of small worth together under general categories
 such as 4Tor things unseen or forgotten" and
 ''other old lumber." Small items, such as knives

 and spoons, or relatively inexpensive goods such as
 earthenware appear in Chesapeake inventories with

 much greater frequency than in the English sample.
 Undoubtedly householders in England owned these
 items, but they went largely unrecorded. Firm con
 clusions therefore can only be drawn from com
 parisons of goods that were normally included in
 inventories in both England and the Tidewater.
 These items are furniture, cooking equipment,
 linen and cloth, and expensive possessions.

 Finally, English and Chesapeake inventoried

 populations reflect the different age structures of
 the two societies. On average, men and women
 living along the tobacco coast died ten years earlier
 than adults in England (Walsh and Menard 1974;
 Smith 1978; Rutman and Rutman 1979). They
 therefore had less time to accumulate household

 were literally scores of different floor plans (Hall
 1983).

 Little evidence survives about the dwellings of

 the poorest people living in the region. The most
 rudimentary were shacks and hovels erected on
 commons, heaths and woodlands which housed

 goods and other possessions. Relatively short life
 spans account, in part, for the poverty exhibited in
 the inventories of most 17th century settlers (Main
 1982:49).

 Dwellings

 The Vale of Berkeley was an important pasture
 farming district in the 17th century and had much
 in common with dairying regions in Hampshire,
 Wiltshire, Dorset and Somerset (Thirsk 1967).
 Characterized by numerous family farms, scattered
 settlement and a good deal of rural manufacture,
 the Vale was considered a particularly fertile area
 (Smyth 1889:4; Defoe 1971:364). Although much
 of the region was enclosed, there were still pockets
 of commonland, generally on marginal soils,
 where villagers raised cattle and sheep. Availabil
 ity of commons was vital to smallholders who
 earned a living partly from farming and partly
 from various by-employments, notably woollen
 manufacture (de Lacy Mann 1971; Perry 1945;
 Smyth 1902).

 Housing in the region was characterized above
 all by diversity. In the upper part of the Severn
 valley, timberframe dwellings in the square
 panelled tradition of the West Midlands remained
 common throughout the 17th and early 18th cen
 turies (Hey 1974:122; Smith 1985;691). Further
 south, stone and rubble were the most common
 building materials, with bricks being generally
 reserved for chimneys. Roofing was usually of
 stone, tiles or thatch (Hall 1983:1, 3, 29, 33-34).
 Dwellings with a through-passage were the domi
 nant type until the mid-17th century but thereafter,
 as rebuilding went on apace, other floor plans were
 adopted or adapted to suit local needs. Within the
 three basic types found in the area?through
 passage, central-passage and no-passage?there

 itinerant laborers and vagrants. A squatter's cot
 tage dating from the late 17th or early 18th
 centuries found in the parish of Iron Acton, just
 north of Bristol, measured 10-foot square and had
 two stories (Hall 1983: 183-84). Eighteen cot
 tages erected on wasteland in Urchfont, Wiltshire,

 in the late 16th and early 17th centuries ranged in
 size from 10 by 18 feet to 15 by 15. The average
 was fourteen by ten feet (Bettey 1983: 28-30).

 It is improbable that these tiny, and often
 flimsy, structures were numerous by the post
 Restoration period. It has been suggested that the
 two or three-roomed cottage was the smallest form
 of housing common in central and southern En
 gland in this period (Barley 1967: 762). Inventory
 evidence, although slight, bears out this view. Of
 10 people who died in the Vale of Berkeley
 between 1660 and 1700 worth less than ?10, 4
 lived in two rooms, 2 in three rooms, 1 in four

 rooms and 3 in five rooms. The mean average was
 3.3 rooms. People living in two rooms may have
 inhabited shacks such as those described above

 but, more likely, lived in parts of bigger tene
 ments. Agricultural laborers from the Frampton
 Cotterell area, to the south of the Vale, usually
 lived in three-roomed cottages (Moore 1976:
 35-36). Despite their small size (20 by 20 or 20 by
 35 feet) such dwellings were often well con
 structed by local craftsmen and built to last (Hall
 1983: 22).

 The commonest housing in the region had be
 tween five and seven rooms. Two-thirds of the
 inhabitants who died worth ?10 to ?49 lived in

 dwellings of five or more rooms, while those
 worth ?50 to ?99 lived in houses of six to seven

 rooms. The mean number of rooms per house was
 5.3 and 6.4 respectively. Room names provide
 clues to the layout of the dwellings. The larger
 number of different room names emphasizes the
 great variety of housing in the Vale but certain
 common features emerge. A 'typical' five-roomed

 house had a hall, kitchen and buttery on the ground
 floor and two chambers above, probably over the
 hall and kitchen. Larger dwellings usually had a
 hall, kitchen and buttery on the ground floor with
 three chambers over them, and possibly one or two
 lofts. Extra rooms did not necessarily imply
 greater domestic comfort since larger dwellings
 may have contained more storage rooms necessary

 for keeping foodstuffs, raw materials and working
 tools.

 There was no sharp distinction between the
 dwellings of middling groups and those of rich
 householders. Parish gentry and substantial yeo
 men lived in houses of between eight and 15
 rooms; wealthy retailers and artisans in dwellings
 of nine or 10 rooms. Many appear to have had a
 similar layout to smaller houses with the addition
 of a parlor, cellar, whitehouse, and extra lofts.
 They usually had more hearths, providing warmth

 and light to a larger range of chambers and ground
 floor rooms than in humbler structures. There was

 also greater potential for more specialized use of
 domestic space, but building materials and styles
 did not differ significantly from other housing.
 Only at the very pinnacle of society were differ
 ences in terms of style and size of dwellings
 striking. Smalcombe Court, owned by the Smyth
 family, stewards to the Lords Berkeley, had at
 least 27 rooms. Few but the county elite could
 afford to keep up with the latest fashions in
 architecture and ornamental gardens. Not only
 were their building materials different?dressed
 stone or brick?but the architecture owed as much

 to metropolitan taste as vernacular tradition.

 A number of points from this brief survey of
 housing in the Vale of Berkeley are worth stress
 ing. As in other parts of central and southern
 England, the medieval open hall house had given
 way during the 15th and 16th centuries to the
 multi-roomed, two story dwelling, allowing
 greater specialization in the use of domestic space
 and also more comfort (Smith 1985: 689-90).
 Apart from makeshift structures on wastes and in
 woodlands, the smallest houses were generally
 three-roomed cottages; sturdily built of local ma
 terials by village craftsmen. Most of the Vale's
 inhabitants, however, probably lived in larger

 78 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 22

 dwellings of between four and seven rooms.
 Houses were made to last. Given reasonable main

 tenance they would stand for centuries. Built of
 rubble, stone, brick and tile, they were sufficiently
 well-constructed to be durable, but also suffi
 ciently flexible in plan and structure to allow the
 addition of new rooms when necessary (Hall
 1983).

 The contrast with Chesapeake housing is stark.
 Typical Chesapeake dwellings were about 20 by
 16 feet and, as Walsh points out, were very unlike
 vernacular buildings in England (Walsh 1977:
 248-50). Settlers developed a structure appropri
 ate to their needs and available materials. Houses

 were constructed entirely of wood with the whole
 of the outside covered with riven oak clapboards
 (Figure 3). Clapboards not only provided the
 exterior surface but also constituted an essential

 structural element of the dwelling. Such dwellings,
 termed "Virginia houses" by the third quarter of
 the 17th century, were easy and cheap to construct
 but did not last as long as English buildings
 (Carson 1974).

 This latter aspect of Chesapeake housing has led
 some architectural historians to characterize the

 vernacular buildings of the region as "imper
 manent" (Carson, et al, 1981). "Tobacco barns
 and dwelling houses", says Walsh, "were in
 tended by the builders to last only for a few years,
 and their construction was apparently such that it
 was almost invariably easier to put up a new
 building than to repair the old one" (Walsh 1977:
 252). The nature of tobacco culture and land
 ownership also contributed to an "architecture of
 transience." When fields became exhausted, the

 owner sometimes simply moved to another part of
 the tract where a new dwelling could be quickly
 erected. The old building would be left to decay.
 Local building materials, the development of a
 distinctive Chesapeake form of architecture, rav
 ages of climate, and the demands of tobacco
 culture all contributed to the short life-span of
 housing; perhaps no more than 20 to 25 years.

 As far as domestic living standards are con

 cerned, the most important aspect of the typical
 Chesapeake dwelling was its small size. The vast
 majority of houses had only one or two rooms.

 FIGURE 3. Recreation of a 17th Century Chesapeake House in St. Mary's City, Maryland based upon historical,
 architectural and archaeological evidence.

 Fewer than 50 out of a sample of over 1400 house
 holders along the lower Western Shore of Mary
 land, between 1658 and 1705, owned dwellings
 with more than two rooms (St. Mary's City Com
 mission). Except perhaps in summer when people
 could live partially outside, these were the physical
 constraints placed upon the daily domestic routine
 of the great bulk of planters. This factor in itself has
 a considerable bearing on a comparison of living
 standards in England and the Chesapeake.

 Middle Class Households Worth

 itants in the Vale and between 50 and 60 percent in
 Maryland and Virginia (Horn 1981:93, 101; forth
 coming). There is little evidence concerning the
 standard of living of the very poor worth less than
 ?10. In England, they included the aged, poor
 widows, paupers and laborers, but the vast major
 ity did not go through probate (Horn 1981:
 85-94). Planters who had not lived sufficiently
 long to get started or who had simply failed to
 make a living from growing tobacco comprise the
 majority of the very poor in the Chesapeake. Since
 the numbers are small, conclusions must remain
 tentative but the contrast between the Vale of

 Berkeley poor and the Maryland and Virginia
 samples is nevertheless striking. The most impres

 and the Chesapeake. Although at the bottom of the
 social and economic ladder, the majority of the
 very poor in the Vale possessed what were consid
 ered the basic necessities of life. Virtually every
 one had a bed (97.3%) and over 80% had bed
 steads. People without bedsteads probably slept
 on mattresses on the floor in a similar fashion to

 that described by William Harrison in the 16th
 century (Harrison 1968: 201). Beds and bedding
 were cheap and unsophisticated. The mean value
 of a bed, bedstead and "appurtenances" (cover
 lets, rug, blankets, and possibly sheets) was ?1.17,
 compared to ?1.93 for all groups. Most of the very
 poor possessed tables and seats. Over 80% had a
 table or table board and two-thirds had some kind

 of seating. Chairs and forms were most common.
 Other furniture, however, was less frequently
 owned. Thirty percent had cupboards, although
 most of these must have been of crude construction

 since in no case were they worth more than a few
 shillings. Only 11% had sideboards, while more
 elaborate case furniture such as presses and chests
 of drawers were entirely absent. Very few poor
 owned goods that were not essential to everyday
 domestic life. Some possessed a few books, while
 chamberpots, lighting untensils, and warming
 pans?items which, although not essential, made
 home life a little more comfortable?were scarce.

 If the very poor in the Vale owned the basic
 necessities, the poor in the Chesapeake did not.
 Seventeenth century colonists' standards of suffi
 ciency, comfort and luxury were not simply more
 modest versions of those in England, they were
 different standards altogether. Apart from a few
 chairs and couches, furniture of any kind was
 entirely missing from the households of the very
 poor in Maryland and Virginia. Virtually all
 householders at this level were without bedsteads,

 and only two-thirds even owned a proper mattress.
 Rags or piles of straw perhaps served those who
 could not afford bedding. Over 70% of the St.
 Mary's group and 55.6% of the Virginia sample
 were without seating. They had to make do by
 sitting on the floor or using up-turned barrels,
 pails and chests. Other common domestic furniture
 was non-existent. Cooking equipment, for the
 most part, was limited to an iron pot or two for

 boiling mush and stew. Inventories less commonly
 mention a frying pan. As one might expect,
 non-essentials and luxury goods, with the impor
 tant exception of books, were completely absent.

 Living standards of the very poor have been
 described as "remarkably, almost unimaginably
 primitive. . . . Equipment of any kind was so
 scarce that we must look to aboriginal cultures to
 find modern analogies that even approximate these
 pre-consumer living conditions of the seventeenth
 century" (Carson and Carson 1976: 17). Barbara
 and Cary Carson provide a graphic illustration of
 the living conditions of the poor in southern
 Maryland:

 It is suppertime. A wife, husband, two children, and
 perhaps a servant are gathered together in the perpetual dusk

 of their shuttered cottage. This evening, like most evenings,
 their dinner is cornmeal mush boiled in an iron pot. The

 food is ladled into five plates or porringers, one for each
 person. The father sets his down on a large storage trunk
 which he straddles and sits on. His daughter is perched on
 the edge of a small chest, the only other piece of furniture

 in the room. The rest either stand or squat along the walls.
 They spoon up the food from the plates they must hold in

 their hands or place on the floor. They drink milk or water
 from a common cup, tankard or bowl passed around. No
 candle or lamp is lighted now or later when the room grows
 completely dark except for the glow of embers on the
 hearth. Nightfall puts an effective end to all the day's
 activities. While someone rinses the bowls in a bucket of

 water (there being only one pot), someone else drags out a
 cattail mattress and arranges it in front of the fire. The
 husband, wife, and daughter lie down there, covering
 themselves with a single canvas sheet and a worn-out bed
 rug. The son and servant roll up in blankets on the floor.
 For warmth all sleep in their clothes. (Carson and Carson
 1976: 9-10).

 As the Carsons point out, this is a fictional and
 in some respects an unprovable recreation of the
 most wretched conditions in which poor planters
 lived. But on the other hand, conditions such as
 these, or similar to them, were to be found among
 the poor throughout the Chesapeake. Evidence
 from Charles County, Maryland, and Lancaster
 and Northumberland counties, Virginia, confirms
 the Carsons' findings for St. Mary's County.
 Moreover, these conditions were not merely con
 fined to the very poor. The above reconstruction
 could almost equally apply to a planter in the ?10
 to ?49 wealth group.

 82 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 22

 the standard of living of lower middle class com
 pared to the very poor, the primitiveness of do
 mestic conditions is nevertheless remarkable. In

 both Maryland and Virginia, half of the decedents
 worth between ?10 and ?49 lacked any seating,
 and between 70% and 80% were without bed

 steads. Tables were to be found in only a third of
 the households. Other furniture was even less

 common. In the Virginia sample, there does ap
 pear to have been an important increase in the
 number of householders owning linen. Linen of
 any kind was missing from the under ?10 group
 whereas nearly one-half of the ?10-?49 group
 owned either table linen, sheets or both. This
 pattern is not repeated in the St. Mary's County
 sample. These differences may reflect regional
 variations in marketing by English manufacturers
 or possibly in living standards, but it is important
 to remember that in both samples the size of the
 under ?10 group is small (15 in the case of St.
 Mary's and nine in Virginia) and therefore might
 be unreliable.

 Sitting down at meals on furniture, or even
 standing at a table, as the Carsons suggest, was not
 yet a convenience that most planters worth less
 than ?50 could afford. Sleeping arrangements were
 similarly crude. Few householders had the plea
 sure of sleeping on a bed and bedstead with proper
 bedding. In short, "these were people living at a
 subsistence level. In a life-time of hard work many

 were no better equipped than newly arrived inden
 tured servants ..." (Carson and Carson 1976:15).

 Again, the contrast with householders in the Vale
 of Berkeley is striking. Houses of weavers, cloth
 workers, poorer artisans and smallholders, who
 comprised the majority of the lower-middling
 groups worth between ?10 and ?49, in every case
 contained beds, bedsteads and bedding and gener

 ally had tables, chairs and other forms of seating.
 Mary Martimore, widow in the parish of Berkeley,
 died in the spring of 1663 worth about ?16. She
 owned two beds and bedsteads, with pillows and
 sheets; two large tableboards with frames; a side
 cupboard; three coffers; a chair and another table
 board with a frame. Judging by the cooking uten
 sils, she mainly boiled her food in a "brasspot" or

 Charles Smyth, a tailor also of Berkeley, died in the
 same year worth about ?20. His house had at least

 five rooms: three on the ground floor, including his
 shop, and two chambers. He owned three beds,
 bedsteads and "appurtenances", several tables,
 and a range of seating consisting of chairs, forms
 and stools. He kept his clothes in a "presse" and
 stored household linen in a chest in the chamber

 over the hall. Both chambers appear to have been
 used solely for sleeping and storing of clothes and
 linen. The hall was probably Smyth's main living
 room, while the buttery served as a kitchen (Glou
 cestershire Records Office, Probate Inventories,
 1663/51, 1663/67).

 Cupboards, sideboards, and clothes presses?
 items of furniture rarely found in the households of
 Chesapeake planters worth less than ?50?were
 much more commonplace in the Vale. These items
 provided a more convenient means of storing
 goods than the ubiquitous chest or trunk. There
 was also a greater readiness to invest in non
 essential items. Nearly a quarter of the Vale of
 Berkeley sample possessed warming pans, testify
 ing to the superiority of beds and bedding in the
 English sample, and just under 10 percent owned a
 small piece of silver or jewelry?perhaps a family
 heirloom. The main luxuries that poor and lower
 middling Chesapeake planters allowed themselves
 were lighting equipment and books. Titles are not
 usually mentioned but most books appear to have
 been bibles and devotional works. Given the low

 incidence of apparent book ownership in the Vale,
 it may be that books, like other small items, were
 not generally appraised in English inventories.
 Discrepancies between the English and Chesa
 peake samples for small objects might possibly
 reflect differing recording practices in the two
 societies, rather than different consumer patterns.

 "THE BARE NECESSITIES" 83

 (Table 2). Householders of between ?50 and ?99
 (better off leaseholders and small landowners)
 appear to have formed an intermediate group
 between the living standards of the poor and those
 of the middling and rich. There was generally
 more furniture. Between a half and three-quarters
 of decedents in the Maryland and Virginia samples
 owned tables and most householders (70% to 80)

 had seating of some kind. There was also a marked
 improvement in beds and bedding. Nearly 60% of
 the Virginia sample and 40% of St. Mary's house
 holders in this wealth group owned bedsteads. A
 similar proportion (40% to 60%) were able to
 cover their beds with sheets, while approaching a
 third had curtains and valances.

 Diet also appears to have improved. Most house
 holders were equipped with boiling, frying and
 roasting implements. John Baley of Lancaster
 County, Virginia, who died in 1695 worth about
 ?56, owned 2 brass kettles, 1 small spit and drip
 ping pan, 2 iron kettles, 1 frying pan, 2 pots, po
 tracks, and a pair of pothooks (Lancaster County
 Records, Wills 8:49). John Pearse, who died in

 neighboring Northumberland County in 1667 worth
 about ?83, had 2 iron pots, 1 frying pan, 2 spits, 1
 dripping pan, 1 brass pot and kettle "all very old",
 2 pair of pothooks, and 1 pair of potracks (Nor
 thumberland County Records 1666-72: 220, 228).
 Along with a greater variety of cooking equipment,
 there was also a greater number of implements, in
 contrast to the one or two iron pots and occasional
 frying pan commonly found in the inventories of
 planters worth less than ?50.

 Another notable improvement was in dining
 habits. About half the householders of the

 ?50-?99 wealth group in Maryland and Virginia
 were able to cover their tables with tablecloths,
 and almost everyone could set their tables with
 pewter plates and dishes. Nearly half the sample in
 both colonies owned earthen or stoneware, and
 few possessed glassware.

 Non-essential items are also found in greater
 numbers in the households of the ?50 to ?99

 group. Lighting equipment (candles, candlesticks,
 snuffers) was present in half the inventories of this
 group, compared to between 27% and 30% of the
 ?10-?49 group, and 11% to 20% of the under ?10

 group. Being able to light the house artificially in
 the evenings must have made a substantial differ

 ence in the quality of life by lengthening the day's
 activities. The daily routine need no longer be
 circumscribed by the hours of daylight.

 If the ?50 to ?99 group represents a transitory
 stage from poor to rich, the ?100 to ?249 group

 displays the first substantial improvement in living
 standards in both colonies. At this level most

 people owned basic furniture such as tables, seats,
 beds and bedsteads. The great majority owned
 sheets, as well as table linens, and between half
 and two-thirds possessed curtains and valances.
 More elaborate beds and bedding were reflected by
 their rising value. The average value of beds,
 bedding and bedsteads of all wealth groups in St.
 Mary's County across the period 1658 to 1700 was
 around ?2.50 (SMCC, Inventories 1658-1700).
 Planters in the ?100-?249 category, however,
 commonly owned beds of twice this value. Edward
 Fish wick, for example, owned six "feather beds
 and furniture" valued at ?30 (SMCC Inventories,

 637). John Tennison of the same county, who died
 in the following year worth ?209, possessed "2
 old feather pillows, 1 bolster, 1 feather bed, 2
 blankets, 1 Worsted Rugg, Reg serge curtaines and
 vallens, and bedstead" appraised at ?4 10s. 6d.
 (SMCC Inventories, 632). Clearly, as wealth and
 status increased, so there was a greater investment

 in more expensive and comfortable bedding.

 Similarly, there were notable improvements in
 other aspects of everyday home life. Most people
 had boiling, frying and roasting equipment, but
 there was also a few specialized implements for
 preparing sauces, pastries, and fish. Almost every
 one ate their meals from pewter dishes, and there is
 more evidence of the use of knives at the table.

 Furnishings were also more varied, with larger
 numbers of people owning cupboards and chests of
 drawers. The incidence of non-essential items also

 increased significantly in this wealth group.
 Warming pans, lighting equipment, chamberpots,
 books, plate, jewelry, and timepieces all become
 common.

 A number of contrasts with English households
 stand out. In the Vale of Berkeley, middling and
 upper-middling wealth holders?mainly husband

 "THE BARE NECESSITIES" 85

 men, yeomen, wealthy artisans and retailers (Horn
 1981:93)?lived in houses of between five and
 eight rooms compared to the three to five rooms
 inhabited by their counterparts in the Chesapeake
 (Moore 1976:36; Main 1982:152). Problems of
 space accounts, in large part, for the smaller
 incidence of domestic furniture among middle
 class and relatively affluent Maryland and Virginia
 planters. Whereas basic furniture, such as chairs
 and tables, are to be found in virtually every
 household in the ?50-?99 category in the Vale,
 between a half and a quarter of planters in this
 group still had to make do without (Table 2).
 Among the upper-middle class (?100-?249) the
 gap between the English and Chesapeake samples
 closes, but it is notable that the range of case
 furniture is usually less in Maryland and Virginia
 inventories. On the other hand, curtains and va

 lances appear more frequently in Chesapeake house
 holds and were perhaps more important in provid
 ing privacy in a crowded dwelling than in England,
 where separate chambers were set aside exclu
 sively for sleeping. Finally, there appears to have
 been a greater predisposition among tobacco plant
 ers to invest in non-essential items such as pictures
 and books, which may have helped to brighten up
 the home or perhaps served as reminders of En
 gland.

 Material Possessions of Rich Householders
 Worth ?250 and Over

 The economic elite, as here defined, comprised
 about 10 percent of the population in the Vale of
 Berkeley and between 10 and 15 percent in Mary
 land and Virginia. Table 3 suggests that their
 domestic furnishings were quite similar. Ordinary
 furniture was present in every household and in
 larger numbers than lower wealth groups. Substan
 tial wealth brought a more varied diet, greater
 comfort in dining and sleeping, and also a higher
 investment in non-essential items, particularly sil
 ver plate. Nearly three-quarters of the St. Mary's
 County elite and two-thirds of the Virginia elite
 owned plate, jewelry or both. Like the rich in
 England, wealthy Chesapeake planters bought

 plate both as a sound investment and as a sign of
 high social status. "I esteem it as well politic as
 reputable," William Fitzhugh of Westmoreland
 County, Virginia, commented, "to furnish my self
 with a handsom cupboard of plate which gives my
 self the present use and credit, is a sure friend at a

 dead lift, with out much loss, or is a certain portion
 for a child after my decease" (Walsh 1979:12).
 Few gentry in the Vale of Berkeley would have
 disagreed.

 Some members of the Chesapeake's elite en
 joyed much more elaborate housing than the five to
 six rooms common at this level (Main 1982:152).

 Benjamin Solley, a leading merchant of St. Mary's
 County died in 1675, inhabited a dwelling with
 four or five ground floor rooms, three chambers
 and a loft (SMCC Inventories, 281). The largest
 dwellings probably had about a dozen rooms. It is
 difficult to visualize the appearance of these
 houses. Most were likely to have been rambling
 wooden structures; there were very few brick or
 stone dwellings built in the 17th century (Carson et
 al 1981). The point to stress, however, is that for

 every example of a wealthy householder living in a
 "multi-room Great house," one can cite other
 examples of the rich living in typically small
 Chesapeake cottages (Walsh 1977:258-59). Apart
 from the exceptionally wealthy, the homes of
 Chesapeake planters tended "to be small, incon
 spicuous, and inconsequential" (Main 1982:153).
 In Maryland and Virginia, the vast majority of the
 homes of leading merchants and planters "might
 be mistaken for modest farm cottages in England"
 (Walsh 1979:7-8).

 Table 3 tends to obscure important qualitative
 differences between furnishings in the two soci
 eties, since the data merely indicate the proportion
 of wealth holders owning certain items, not their
 value or quality. Hence, there might be a world of
 difference between an old wooden chair belonging
 to a Chesapeake planter and a great 'turkey work'
 chair owned by one of the Vale of Berkeley's
 wealthiest gentlemen. In the great parlor of John
 Smyth's house in North Nibley, Gloucestershire,
 there stood "one ovill table board [with a] Turkie
 Karpett, a dozen and a halfe of Turkie Chairs, one
 Turkie worke Couch, ..." worth, with a few

 other furnishings, ?17 (GRO Inventories, 1692/
 159). Among the wealthy in the Vale, beds worth
 ?5 or more were commonplace. Elaborate case
 furniture was usually valued at between ?1 and ?2,
 while tables and chairs might be three or four times
 more expensive than the normal value (GRO,
 Inventories, 1660-1699; PRO.PCC, PROB 4
 and 5).

 Expensive furniture is also to be found in the
 inventories of wealthy planters such as Colonel
 John Carter of Lancaster, James Bowling and Cap
 tain Joshua Doyne of St. Mary's (Lancaster County
 Records, Wills 8, 22-29, 32-34; SMCC Invento
 ries, 1067, 1315). But old, broken or worn out
 goods are also commonly mentioned among the
 possessions of leading planters. Captain William
 Brocas of Lancaster County, a justice of the peace
 and former member of Virginia's Council, owned
 at his death in 1655, "a parcel of old hangings, very
 thin and much worn," "a parcel of old Chairs,
 being 7, most of them unusefull," "an old broken
 Cort Cupboard," "1 old rotten couch bedsteads,"
 "1 old broken trunk, 7 guns most unfixt," and so
 on (Lancaster County Records, Deeds, 202-04;
 Deeds 2, 40). Similarly, many of the household
 possessions of John Godsell, a merchant who died
 in 1676 worth over ?300, were described in his

 inventory as " old," " damnified," " motheaten,''
 and "rotten" (Lancaster County Records, Wills 5,
 19-22). Virtually all the furniture owned by Mr.
 Thomas Wilks, who died ten years later worth about
 ?1000, is described as "old" (Lancaster County
 Records, Wills, 5 104-08).

 Comparing the data presented in Tables 2 and 3,
 it is perhaps surprising that there were not greater
 differences between the living standards of the rich
 and other wealth groups. Like most householders,

 the Vale's rich ate their meals from pewter plates
 and drank from pewter flagons. Inventories show
 no evidence that wealthy persons owned fine ce
 ramics, and less than a tenth of the ?250 plus group
 possessed glassware. (It is, of course, possible that

 appraisers missed or failed to individually list these
 items.) Although the wealthy tended to have a
 greater range of furniture, articles such as couches,
 chests of drawers, and desks were far from com
 mon. Even case furniture, such as cupboards,

 presses, and sideboards were to be found in barely
 half the inventories. These considerations apply
 also to the Vale's gentry. Of seven gentlemen worth
 over ?250, none apparently possessed any special
 cooking equipment?fish plates, pastry dishes,
 pudding pots, apple or bread toasters?and there
 was no evidence of fine ceramics. Only two men
 owned glassware and only four had elaborate case
 furniture. The gentry had more expensive tastes in
 clothing and they tended to invest a larger propor
 tion of their money in plate, but generally their
 domestic furnishings differed little from wealthy
 non-gentry. An altogether different style of living
 only becomes apparent among the top rank of gen

 tlemen (country gentry), who built, or rebuilt, large
 country houses and furnished them with the most
 expensive and luxurious items (Atkyns 1712).
 What seems to be missing in the second half of the
 17th century are upper class rituals such as tea,

 coffee, or chocolate-drinking, eating from tables set
 with fine porcelain, knives and forks. These de
 velopments awaited the 18th century.

 Differences in the standards of living between the
 rich and the middling wealth groups were therefore

 a matter of degree rather than kind. Mildred Camp
 bell's comments concerning the English yeomanry
 are just as applicable to the majority of middle and
 upper class householders in the Vale: "the inven

 tories show . . . that the standard of living, in so far

 as the quality and variety of household furnishings
 reveal it, was remarkably similar among the yeo
 men of greater and less wealth. The difference lay
 in the numbers of rooms to be furnished rather than

 the style, variety and quality of the furnishings"
 (Campbell 1967: 238-39). Neither the economic
 elite in general, nor the gentry in particular, com
 prised a "Venetian oligarchy" in the 17th century.
 Class divisions were fluid and distinctions between
 middle and upper classes remained ill-defined
 (Wrightson 1977: 33-47).

 Despite important differences in living standards
 between rich and poor, historians of the 17th
 century Chesapeake have tended to stress the
 essential similarity of the domestic environment.
 "All in all," the Carsons conclude, "there was a
 decided sameness about material life in southern

 Maryland throughout the 17th century. Partly it

 was a result of a limited choice of available

 consumer goods and partly a reflection of a com
 munity that was still more homogeneous, still less
 attenuated by extremes of wealth, than it became
 fifty years later." "Being rich," they suggest,
 "meant having more, not being different" (Carson
 and Carson 1976:17, 21). Research by Walsh
 supports this view and she notes that "while
 families in higher wealth levels enjoyed a greater
 degree of comfort than did poorer households,
 until the end of the period (1720), most did not use

 personal possessions to create a markedly different
 way of living from their poorer neighbors." The
 Chesapeake was "a place where social elites did
 not develop distinct identities based on patterns of
 consumption very different from those of groups
 somewhat below them" (Walsh 1979: 7-8).

 This view should be qualified, however. The
 elite in Maryland and Virginia were no more
 monolithic than in England. Even at a relatively
 early stage of Chesapeake social development
 there were some individuals who, by virtue of their
 office, inherited status, or wealth, stood head and

 shoulders above the rest of the gentry. These men,

 such as the Carters, Lees, Wormeleys and Byrds of
 Virginia, ranked with country magnates in English
 society (Bailyn 1959) and clearly did develop a
 different style, as well as standard of living appro
 priate to their high status. As in England, there
 fore, a comparison of middle and upper class
 material possessions suggests a gradual rather than
 dramatic improvement in living standards, with a
 sharp break occurring only at the very pinnacle of
 the social order. In both societies, the distinction

 between top gentry and the rest of the squirarchy
 became clearer in the 18th century with the growth
 of magnate power (Plumb 1967; Speck 1977;
 Bailyn 1959; Morgan 1975).

 Conclusion

 The most important conclusion to be drawn
 from a comparison of material possessions in the
 two societies is the great poverty experienced by
 most Chesapeake planters during the 17th century.
 Even the lowest economic group in England had

 living standards comparable in many respects to
 those of householders of middling wealth in Mary
 land and Virginia. To put it another way, only
 householders belonging to the two upper wealth
 groups in the Chesapeake had living standards that
 would be accounted quite ordinary in England. Not
 only were essential items of furniture such as
 tables, seats, beds, and bedsteads often missing
 from the households of most planters, but there
 was also an important qualitative difference in
 furnishings. In general, the value of furniture in
 both societies was similar. Beds and bedding were
 commonly valued at between ?1 and ?5, tables
 between two and five shillings, chairs and stools a
 shilling, bedsteads five shillings, and more elabo
 rate case furniture from a few shillings to over ?1.
 Yet there was a much greater range of values in
 Maryland and Virginia than in the Vale of Berke

 ley; a consequence of a great number of very low
 valuations found in Chesapeake inventories.

 A qualitative difference between furniture in the
 two societies is also suggested by descriptions used
 by appraisers. In English inventories, it is very rare
 for items to be described as "new" or "old," but
 in Chesapeake inventories the term "old" is ex
 tremely common. Old, broken, and worn goods
 still retained a certain value in the Chesapeake
 because it was cheaper to mend them, or use them
 for something else, than to buy new goods. Plant
 ers had to rely on English merchants to import
 manufactured goods, especially metal wares,
 which always seemed to be in short supply, hence
 the value of second hand items. Poverty was
 therefore reflected not only by an absence of
 essential furniture, but also in the often poor
 condition of the limited items that were owned.

 Housing was greatly inferior in Maryland and
 Virginia compared to England. While imperma
 nent structures?squatters' shacks or pauper
 dwellings?existed in England, they were increas
 ingly rare in the second half of the 17th century
 and did not house the majority of poor. Single or
 two-room farm cottages were also becoming less
 common in southern and central England as a
 consequence of the substantial rebuilding which
 occurred throughout the late Tudor and Stuart
 periods (Barley 1967; Smith 1985). Thus, in the

 Vale of Berkeley, the poor and lower middling
 groups lived in houses of three to five rooms, built
 by local craftsmen of durable materials. Whereas
 in England, the trend during the previous two
 centuries had been towards more specialized room
 use and permanent structures, in the early Chesa
 peake, these developments were reversed: dwell
 ings were not expected to last more than 20 to 25
 years and a single or two rooms served a multi
 plicity of functions (Carson et al, 1981). Conse
 quently, in most dwellings, there simply was not
 enough space for much furniture. The most useful
 item for the small planter was the versatile chest,
 which could serve as a table or seat as well as for

 nomic climate, particularly after 1680, and the
 general difficulty of acquiring manufactured goods
 from England. Only the top 30% of planters, who
 managed to acquire over ?100 in personalty at
 death, approached living conditions commonplace
 in England. Whatever advantages moving to the
 New World may have brought, for most settlers it
 did not bring domestic comfort. During the second
 half of the century, most planters endured a stan
 dard of living little different from that of the lowest
 levels of society in England.

 storing goods.

 The social and psychological implications of
 this transformation in living standards have yet to

 be fully considered by social historians or archae
 ologists. Obviously, important changes in domes
 tic lifestyle must have resulted from the cramped
 living conditions experienced by the vast majority
 of planters along the tobacco coast. A division of
 domestic space according to gender and status
 could not be enforced in humble Chesapeake
 structures where men and women, masters and

 servants, parents and children all lived in close
 proximity. Were family tensions exacerbated by
 lack of privacy? To what extent did the "decided
 sameness" of material life in the 17th century
 Chesapeake erode traditional English social dis
 tinctions and alter perceptions of status? Did low
 standards of living contribute not only to an
 "architecture of transcience" but also to a menta

 lite of transience; an easy-come, easy-go attitude
 whereby people packed up their goods and moved
 on when debts became too great or the going too
 hard (Horn 1987)?

 For the majority of English people who emi
 grated to the Chesapeake in the 17th century, one
 of the most important differences they would
 encounter in their new environment was a substan

 tially lower standard of living. This was a conse
 quence not of their own humble origins and lack of
 aspiration to create a better way of life, or of the
 relatively short life-span that most of them expe
 rienced but rather of the peculiar demands of
 tobacco culture, the increasingly unfavorable eco
