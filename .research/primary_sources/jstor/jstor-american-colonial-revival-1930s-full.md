 The American Colonial Revival

 in the 1930os
 David Gebhard

 N 1930 CLAUDE H. MILLER emphasized,

 "every community should have at least one
 example of a type of architecture [the colo-

 nial] that has survived for more than two hundred

 years and that has, today, a far greater appeal than
 any time in its history." And indeed, the architects,
 builders, and clients of the depression years of the
 1930S not only made sure that there was one ex-
 ample but also made the colonial the most preva-
 lent and popular architectural image of the time.
 By the thirties the colonial had already enjoyed
 well over half a century of revival. As a continually
 transformed image, it had shown a remarkable
 ability to shift its ground and to absorb whatever
 happened to be the current fashion, whether visual
 or ideological.' In the 188os and later, the colonial
 mingled with the English Queen Anne to produce
 the shingle style; in the 189os and on into the
 1900s, it brought forth its own version of the classi-
 cal beaux-arts. In this century colonial elements
 were a continuous ingredient in craftsman ar-
 chitecture and design (finally usurping it), while in
 the twenties the colonial types became one of the
 contending, openly romantic, period-revival styles.

 New York architect Chester Homes Aldrich re-

 marked when commenting on his own work (Del-
 ano and Aldrich) in 1929, "Today we may design a
 so-called Georgian house, endeavoring to capture
 the vital old eighteenth century spirit and yet,

 when we have done it, and provided we have han-
 dled the design with freedom and have answered
 the needs of our present day clients, it will really be
 an expression of our own time. Later on, years
 from now, that house may look like 1929. The re-
 sult of whatever we do shows itself, willy-nilly, the
 seal of our own hand and time."2

 Thus, as Aldrich perceptively observed, the co-
 lonial always ended up commenting on both the
 past and the present. One of the principal argu-
 ments for using the colonial rather than another
 image was its enduring nature, for as a style it had
 remained, while other historic and modern images
 had come and gone with the winds of fashion.
 Writing in 1939, T. C. Hughes, secretary of the
 Detroit chapter of the American Institute of Ar-
 chitects, noted: "In the selection of style, obsoles-
 cence, the enemy of value, should be borne in
 mind. Jigsaw exteriors, overdone bungalows, and
 false gabled English were among many passing
 fads, while good colonial, early American, and
 Georgian have stood the test of time. If well done,
 they will always be good." This perception was not
 limited to architects, but was almost universally be-
 lieved in by the middle and upper-middle classes.
 The editors of Popular Mechanics presented the ar-
 gument in a way that all could understand: "Styles
 in houses come and go like styles in cars.... It pays
 to build in a style as liquid in public approval as a
 Liberty bond at a bank. Colonial is such a style."3
 Why has the colonial endured so long as a safe
 stylistic investment for the American middle and

 upper-middle classes? In the same article in Popu-
 lar Mechanics, three reasons were suggested for its
 popularity: "First, in plan and construction, Colo-

 ties to establish the colonial as the decade's major
 building type? What sources did the architects and
 their clients look to in creating colonial images of
 the thirties? What were the varied colonial images
 (or types) preferred? Were there any appreciable
 changes in the colonial image between 1930 and
 1941? Did these designs make any unique and
 significant contribution to this "time-honored" im-
 age? Who were the principal architectural prac-
 titioners of the colonial at this time? And finally,
 were there any major monuments created that
 spoke the colonial language?

 nial is the outgrowth of simple, honest housing
 requirements of our forefathers, requirements
 which in many ways have not changed greatly since
 the days when Thomas Jefferson built Monticello
 and Washington lived at Mt. Vernon. Second, Co-
 lonial is economical to build due to its simplicity, in
 plan and freedom from over ornamentation;
 third, it has good proportions."4 Here, then, were
 the essential rationales for the persistent use of this
 image: the injection of ethical considerations, such
 as "simple" and "honest"; its symbolism as the
 American national style, from Jefferson and
 Washington to the present; its down-to-earth, sen-
 sible economy of construction; and, finally, its
 adherence to "correct" classical principles of de-
 sign. These explanations, advanced in 1929, be-
 came intensified in the 1930s. Nationalism, as an
 inward-looking affair, the house as a symbol of the
 family, and puritanical simplicity of proportions,
 coupled with a self-conscious modesty of assertion,
 were the hallmarks of the colonial from 1930
 through 1941.

 Before looking into the varied interpretations
 of the colonial and the sources of these interpreta-
 tions which came to the fore in the thirties, we
 should remind ourselves of several premises upon
 which the period revival of the twenties was based.
 Traditionalists insisted that the architect's task was

 not one (nor could it be one) of seeking to replicate
 historic images of the past; rather, the obligation
 was to use historic images as a point of departure
 for the creation of new variations on an existing
 theme. Out of this approach developed the view
 that what architects were dealing with (and this is
 especially the case with the colonial) were architec-
 tural "types," not styles.6

 Our understanding of the twenties and thirties
 has been appreciably expanded beyond that of
 high-art modern. The richness of the popular art
 deco of the twenties and of the streamline mod-

 erne of the thirties now forms a part of our appre-
 ciation of the architecture and design of these two
 decades. Slowly we are beginning also to appre-
 ciate the contributions made by the exponents of
 traditional images.

 Perhaps our first need is to rid ourselves of the

 moral absolutism that the modernists attached to

 Thus, in the 1920os or 1930s, the functional
 needs of the time, of methods of construction, of
 suitable materials and parts, and above all of aes-
 thetic sensibility would of necessity transform the
 traditional image into something fresh and mod-
 ern. This new historic type would end up having
 more in common with other architectural forms

 their cause. The argument of ethicality may just as
 logically be attached to traditional architectural
 modes and especially to the colonial. Nor should
 we inevitably accept the often reported suggestion
 of the relationship between ethicality and design.
 Architect Wells Bennett, writing in 1931, ob-
 served: "The most fastidious of collectors of early
 Americana, however, will not hesitate to park his
 1931 Buick in the replica of a Colonial stable. The
 average citizen does not feel that the fashion of the
 place where he works has anything to do with the
 style of the place where he sleeps, the church
 where he worships, or the monuments in which he
 enshrines his governments and his heroes."5

 In discussing the colonial in the 193os, there

 then in use than it would with its specific historic
 source. By thinking in terms of type rather than
 style, both the architect and the client freed them-

 selves from the illusion of archaeological/historical
 constraints.

 The development of colonial revival imagery of
 the thirties was at least in part due to a broader
 knowledge and appreciation of the country's sev-
 enteenth- through early nineteenth-century ar-
 chitectural inheritance. Throughout the teens and
 into the thirties the principal professional Ameri-
 can journals had published page upon page of
 measured drawings and general interior and ex-
 terior photographs of American colonial architec-
 ture. From the twenties on, the Architectural Record

 are several questions that should be explored and,
 one hopes, answered. What happened in the thir-

 ture, edited by Russell F. Whitehead; the Architec-
 tural Forum presented the colonial in its Interior
 section and later in its Master Detail series; and the
 American Architect provided a view of the colonial
 through its Brick Precedent and Portfolio series.7
 By the mid 1930s the scope of these colonial inserts
 in these major national journals had substantially
 increased; not only did they often tend to be the
 most substantial item in an individual issue, but the
 colonial subject matter eventually all but elimi-
 nated the non-American traditional insert that one

 finds throughout the 1920S.

 It is apparent that these colonial inserts in the

 architectural journals were used directly as source
 material in the design process. The architect's
 characteristic approach was to clip and file the ma-
 terial separately, usually under the categories of
 doorways, windows, mantels, shutters, and so
 forth. These drawings and photographs were then
 consulted, particularly in the preparation of work-
 ing drawings and of details. Such details, garnered
 from the architectural journals, were also used by
 manufacturers; two of the most popular associated
 with the colonial revival in the thirties were Curtis

 Woodwork and Morgan Millwork.8 These presen-
 tations in professional journals were matched by
 increased attention paid to the colonial tradition
 in middle- and upper-middle-class magazines--
 ranging from Good Housekeeping, American Home,
 Better Homes and Gardens, House and Garden, House
 Beautiful, and Ladies' Home Journal to the more elite

 vancing the imagery of seventeenth- and eigh-
 teenth-century colonial Americana.9 Then there
 was a growing number of books depicting
 America's regional colonial architecture. Charac-
 teristic of these were Helen Wilkinson Reynolds,
 Dutch Houses in the Hudson Valley before 1776 (New
 York: Payson and Clarke, 1929), with an introduc-
 tion by Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Eleanor Ray-
 mond, Early Domestic Architecture of Pennsylvania
 (New York: William Helburn, 1931); Mixer
 Knowlton, Old Houses of New England (New York:
 Macmillan, 1927); Thomas T. Waterman and
 John A. Barrows, Domestic Architecture of Tidewater
 Virginia (New York: Scribner's, 1932); and William
 Spratling and Natalie Scott, Old Plantation Houses in
 Louisiana (New York: William Helburn, 1927). For
 interior details architects consulted such special-
 ized volumes as Edith Tunis Sale, Colonial Interiors
 (New York: William Helburn, 1930); for garden
 design, there was the two-volume set by Alice B. B.
 Lockwood, Gardens of Colony and of States: Gardens
 and Gardeners of the American Colonies and the Re-
 public before 1840 (New York: Scribner's, 1931).

 By 1941 the number of popular and profes-
 sional source books on colonial architecture had

 more than doubled, reflecting the deepening inter-
 est in and idolization of early America. These pub-
 lications ranged from the impressive beaux-arts
 drawings contained in the two-volume Great Geor-
 gian Houses of America (New York: Kalkhoff Press,
 1933-37), edited by William L. Bottomley, to nu-
 merous regional studies and monographs on indi-
 vidual "colonial" architects-Samuel McIntire,
 Robert Mills, and the firm of Town and Davis.'o

 9 Nutting's America the Beautiful series eventually con-
 sisted of eight volumes: Vermont Beautiful (1922); Massachusetts
 Beautiful (1923); New Hampshire Beautiful (1923); Connecticut
 Beautiful (1923); Maine Beautiful (1924); Pennsylvania Beautiful
 (1924); New York Beautiful (1927); Virginia Beautiful (1930). All
 these volumes were edited and reissued between 1935 and
 1937. For a discussion of Nutting and his importance in the
 colonial revival of the 1910os and 1920S, see William L. Dulaney,
 "Wallace Nutting: Collector and Entrepreneur," in American
 Furniture and Its Makers: Winterthur Portfolio i3, ed. Ian M. G.
 Quimby (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,
 1979), pp. 47-60; Wallace Nutting, Wallace Nutting's Biography
 (Framingham, Mass.: Old America Co., 1936); and Wallace
 Nutting, Supreme Edition General Catalogue (1930; reprint, Ex-
 ton, Pa.: Schiffer, 1977)-

 10 Characteristic of numerous regional studies often men-
 tioned in the magazines of the time were Herbert Wheaton

 Congdon, Old Vermont Houses: The Architecture of a Resourceful
 People (Brattleboro: Stephen Daye Press, 1940); Charles M.
 Stotz, Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania (New York: Wil-
 liam Helburn, 1936); Harold Donaldson Eberlein and Cort-
 landt Van Dyke Hubbard, Portrait of a Colonial City: Philadelphia,
 1670-1838 (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1939); Rexford
 Newcomb, Old Kentucky Architecture (New York: William Hel-
 burn, 1939); J. Frazer Smith, White Pillars: Early Life and Ar-

 Supplementing this array of professional and

 popular literature was a steadily increasing num-
 ber of picture books and historical studies devoted
 to colonial architecture. Wallace Nutting's 1920S
 series, from Vermont Beautiful to Virginia Beautiful,
 was reissued in the mid 1930s. While these were
 highly personal guides, they were, like his framed
 sepia photographs, his furniture, and his numer-
 ous books on furniture, exclusively devoted to ad-

 s In an advertisement of Curtis Woodwork, published in
 Architectural Forum 51, pt. 1, no. 3 (September 1929): 65, it was
 noted that the work was taken from specific colonial eighteenth-
 century buildings. Advertisements for Curtis Woodwork oc-
 curred both in the professional architectural journals and in the
 popular home magazines throughout the 1930s. For a typical
 example, see Pencil Points 19, no. 4 (April 1938): supp. p. 89.
 Curtis Woodwork also engaged major architects to design many
 of their products such as entrances and fireplace mantels. Sev-
 eral of these designs by Dwight James Baum were presented in
 an advertisement in Pencil Points 19, no. 1 (January 1938): 40.

 Certainly for the public, and one suspects the

 Probably Chamberlain's most popular photo-
 graphic essays were a group of ten small volumes
 devoted to historic New England cities and towns:
 Salem, Cambridge, Martha's Vineyard, Ports-
 mouth, and others. These volumes, like his earlier
 ones, were inexpensive ($1.25) and were beauti-
 fully printed in photogravure. At the same time,
 he issued a series of postcards entitled the Ameri-
 can Scene. Chamberlain's shift to photography and
 to the nostalgic subject of New England and its
 architecture was a shift not only in modes but
 also in audience. These photographic essays were
 aimed more at the middle- and upper-middle-class
 lay audiences than to architects. The timing of
 these picture books and his New England guide-
 book was excellent (if not fortuitous), for with the
 gradual economic improvement of the late 1930s,
 an increased number of Americans visited New
 England, particularly those coming from afar to

 architects as well, one of the most impressive advo-
 cates of the colonial was New England graphic-
 artist-turned-photographer Samuel Chamber-
 lain." During the twenties, Chamberlain's many
 books and numerous illustrations of European ar-
 chitecture published in the professional architec-
 tural journals were continually consulted by ar-
 chitects. His drawings of Italian, Spanish, French,
 and English domestic architecture represented in
 many ways the picturesque ideal that architects
 and clients of the period revivals were seeking to
 realize. In some of these presentations of Europe,
 Chamberlain had supplemented his etchings and
 lithographs with photographs, and by the mid
 1930s the camera had become his principal picto-
 rial tool. From 1936 on, he turned his attention to
 New England and its architecture. "I was at-
 tracted," he later wrote, "to old houses, particularly
 the small ones that could provide ideas for contem-
 porary house builders."'12 The first of his series of
 photographic essays on New England architecture
 was A Small House in the Sun (New York: Hastings
 House, 1936), with, according to the dust jacket,
 "181 illustrations .., .rich in ideas for the prospec-
 tive home builder, since no type of architecture has
 been developed in this country which so satisfacto-
 rily combines the beauty and utility of the Colonial
 House." This volume was followed the next year by
 Cape Cod in the Sun (New York: Hastings House,
 1937) and the first edition of his guidebook, Open
 House in New England (Brattleboro, Vt.: Stephen
 Daye Press, 1937). Four editions of the guidebook
 were issued between 1937 and 1941.

 American image in the thirties was the Works
 Progress Administration's depression-inspired
 American Guide series, which by 1942 had pro-
 duced guides to all the eastern states. These guides
 to the "Colonial East," through their texts, guide
 sections, and photographic illustrations, placed a
 major emphasis on seventeenth- through early
 nineteenth-century architecture.'4

 national home magazines, including Ladies' Home
 Journal, Better Homes and Gardens, and Good House-

 panic, matched his Spanish House for America (Phil-

 (fig. 2). William W. Wurster, Allen C. Collins, and
 Paul Hammarberg, who also designed exposition
 houses scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay
 area, took a similar colonial approach. Two indus-
 try-sponsored idea houses of the Treasure Island
 fair, one by the Gas Industry and the other by
 United States Steel, ran the gamut between a his-
 torically correct version of the California ranch
 house and a more modernized version.17

 Although the three principal expositions of the

 1930S-the 1933/34 Chicago Century of Progress
 Exposition, the 1939 New York World's Fair, and
 the 1939 San Francisco Golden Gate International
 Exposition-were committed to one degree or an-
 other to the modernist cause, they all commented
 on the colonial tradition. At Chicago, Thomas E.
 Tallmadge designed an "American Colonial Vil-
 lage": "Main Street as our great-grandfathers
 knew it" (fig. 1). These buildings, lining the tree-
 shaded street (with attendants and others in appro-
 priate costume), included reproductions of Bos-
 ton's Old State House and of Old Wakefield, where
 George Washington was born. In the case of the
 1939 New York and San Francisco fairs, the colo-
 nial was presented as a contemporary house type
 within their Town of Tomorrow. Of the fifteen
 houses at the New York fair, nine were variations
 of the colonial theme.'6

 commissions during these years) and the lay public
 (with its funds severely limited), national and re-
 gional competitions and the building of demon-
 stration houses were ways in which architecture,
 and especially the colonial tradition, could be expe-
 rienced. While there were always a few streamlined
 moderne designs present in the entries to these
 competitions, the vast majority included references
 to the colonial image. With only a few exceptions,
 the winners and runners-up in these national
 competitions were out-and-out colonial designs.
 Wills, of Boston, one of the most popular as well as
 gifted exponents of the colonial image, entered
 and won numerous awards in these competitions
 of the 1930s, ranging from the 1932 gold medal in
 the Better Homes in America competition to the

 sored by Better Homes and Gardens.'8

 These national competitions and the construc-
 tion of model homes in the thirties enjoyed a wide
 group of sponsors. In the twenties and on into the
 early thirties Herbert Hoover's Better Homes in
 America dominated governmental sponsorship.
 By the midthirties Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
 Federal Housing Administration was both directly
 and indirectly involved in many of the national ar-
 chitectural competitions.19 As in the late teens and

 twenties, various building industries and associa-
 tions initiated competitions, and in the thirties they
 built numerous demonstration houses all over the

 country. Of these, the best advertised and the most
 popular were those sponsored by news, home, and
 professional architectural magazines.

 As far as the middle- and upper-middle-class
 public was concerned, the most discussed of these
 competitions were the two sponsored by Life
 and Architectural Forum (both jointly owned by
 Henry R. Luce) in 1938 and 1940. By mid 1940,
 121 versions of the 16 designs had been built
 across the country; as an added inducement, one

 could purchase, for fifty cents to a dollar, knock-
 down scale models (with furniture) of the first 8
 designs. Of the 16 designs, 6 were openly colonial.
 Examples of the Life colonial houses were con-
 structed as far away from New England and the
 East as Portland, Oregon, and Edina, Minnesota,
 attesting to the widespread interest in these colo-
 nial images.20

 vided by Richard Koch, H. Roy Kelley, Aymar Embury II,
 Cameron Clark, and Treanor and Fatio. Designs that had a
 tinge of the colonial were produced by Gardner Dailey, Shreve,
 Lamb and Harmon, and Shaw, Noess, and Murphy. The Port-
 land, Oreg., Life house was based on Clark's design; that in
 Edina, Minn., on Wills's.

 Life house designs were the prairie Usonian house
 designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and the popular
 Cape Cod cottage by Wills. Although the client for
 the pair (Albert R. Blackbourn of Minneapolis)
 was quoted as leaning toward the former, he
 settled on the Wills scheme and eventually built it
 in 1939 in the suburban Minneapolis community
 of Edina (fig. 3).21

 decorative arts: furniture, wallpaper, fabrics,
 clocks, and dollhouses. Colonial furniture-repro-
 ductions and new variations on the originals-had
 fully come into their own in the 192os. As was the
 case with architecture, colonial furniture emerged
 as the predominant traditional furniture of the
 1930s. The tendency of colonial furniture of the
 thirties was either to approach the theme rather
 freely, as one finds in so much moderate-to-
 inexpensive informal maple and pine living-room,
 dining-room, recreation-room, and children's bed-
 room furniture, or to insist on its being authentic
 and "correct," as one finds in the far more expen-
 sive Williamsburg reproductions. The approach,
 though, in both cases, was to return to the simple,
 earlier period-for maple and pine furniture, to
 the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; for
 Georgian, to the early to mid eighteenth century.

 By the end of the decade these two approaches

 to colonial furniture and decoration were joined by
 a third: that of the urbane sophistication of the
 federal/regency and the Greek revival. And it was
 this later furniture and decoration that was seen as

 the closest link between traditionalism and the

 modern. The ability to furnish and decorate a
 room in the colonial made it possible for the colo-
 nial environment (usually, of course, not as a
 whole, but as a fragment) to be realized by an ap-
 preciable segment of the middle class who were not
 in a financial position to purchase even a new
 "spec-built" house.

 With the substantial drop-off of architectural

 commissions in the thirties, architects and their
 clients turned increasingly to remodeling older
 buildings, as a way to attain a current fashionable
 image inexpensively. In the commercial realm, res-

 Life house was built, but a variation on it, the Bernard Schwartz

 taurants and, above all, funeral homes clothed
 themselves in the colonial image. In domestic ar-
 chitecture, the urge was to colonialize older dwell-
 ings, especially those that represented the "mis-
 guided" taste of the late nineteenth-century
 Victorian episode and the "ungainly" craftsman
 period in the early twentieth century. If a family's
 budget was really limited, one could bring about
 some sort of colonial transformation by purchasing
 catalogue items-entrance doorways, bay win-
 dows, and fireplace mantels-from Curtis Wood-
 work and other national and regional companies.
 The colonial, as the American ideal in the thir-
 ties, received its ultimate stamp of approval from
 Hollywood's motion picture industry. The charac-
 teristic Beverly Hills house of motion picture stars
 and directors was a colonial one, in many instances
 designed by one of Los Angeles's principal domes-
 tic architects: Paul R. Williams, Roland E. Coate,

 toration of the Cite de Carcassonne, and, as Rocke-

 John Byers and Edla Muir, and others.22 The colo-
 nial image provided the backdrop for almost every
 film that was set in a contemporary American sub-
 urban environment. Characteristic of this imagery
 was the setting for Katharine Hepburn and Cary
 Grant's Bringing Up Baby. "Hollywood went tradi-
 tional," noted an article in Good Housekeeping,
 "when it created this refreshing version of an old

 Connecticut house to serve as a background ....
 [Y]ou will find in this house numerous good ideas
 that you will like to use in your own house."
 Pasadena architect Elmer Grey wrote in 1936:
 "The buildings they [the movie sets] depict are not
 permanent to be sure, but they reach many more
 people with their message than do many perma-
 nent buildings, and often in a way that makes very
 lasting impressions. It must be gratifying to feel
 that one is composing pictures which, in their ulti-
 mate life-like realism, enthrall and instruct audi-
 ences of thousands the world over!"'23

 While the sense of modernity and the futurist

 feller wrote, "to restore a complete area and free it
 entirely from alien or inharmonious surroundings
 as well as to preserve the beauty and charm of the
 old buildings and gardens of the city and its histor-
 ical significance." Certainly patriotism (or national-
 ism) and an idealization of the past were crucial to
 Rockefeller's decision to support the project; but
 equally so was his response to it as architecture. As
 a symbol, the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg
 and the adjacent Colonial National Park was the
 principal event that helped to promote the colonial
 revival of the thirties. In 1936, when the American
 Institute of Architects held its annual convention

 there, Hiram J. Herbert wrote in Better Homes and
 Gardens: "Williamsburg isn't only attracting tourists
 this summer by its historical appeal; it also is
 stimulating the desire for better homes." In the
 November 1937 issue of House and Garden, devoted
 to Williamsburg, Richardson Wright, the maga-
 zine's editor, wrote: "[House and Garden] believes
 that the future can learn from the past. It believes
 that the spirit of ancient Williamsburg and the ac-
 tuality of its splendid buildings and homes now
 restored have a definite, necessary and vital mes-
 sage for our times."24

 Although House and Garden commissioned the
 Boston firm of Perry, Shaw, and Hepburn, the ar-
 chitects for the Williamsburg restoration, to design
 three contemporary houses based on Williamsburg
 precedent, the impact of this restoration was essen-
 tially ideological, rather than that of inspiring a
 set colonial image which was widely emulated. In
 the realm of the specific, the effect of Colonial
 Williamsburg was far more pervasive in interior
 decoration. By the mid 1930s, the Craft House at
 Williamsburg was producing "approved reproduc-
 tions and adaptations." Others quickly entered the
 scene. The enterprising Williamsburg Galleries of
 Chicago created a wide collection of moderately
 priced furniture which could be purchased at de-
 partment and furniture stores across the country
 (fig. 4). Within a few years an upper-middle-class
 patron could purchase Williamsburg-inspired
 china, silver, paint colors, fabrics, wallpapers, light-
 ing fixtures, and hardware.25

 exponents of the colonial, architect Dwight James
 Baum, portrayed its progress through a camera in
 the pages of Architecture, and Samuel Chamberlain
 presented the restoration through six etchings
 published in Pencil Points. And as one would ex-
 pect, with the rise of the modern in this decade, it
 was a frequent subject of heated debate. When
 Frank Lloyd Wright held an exhibition of his work
 at the College of William and Mary in Williams-
 burg, he, being the publicist he was, could not re-
 frain from decrying the restoration and its effect
 on current American architecture. Harold R.

 Shurtleff, who had worked on the restoration, re-

 plied to Wright: "it seems a pity that Mr. Wright's

 The restoration of Colonial Williamsburg was a
 catalyst for historic preservation efforts during the
 1930s. In the final years of Hoover's administra-
 tion, the federal government, through the Na-
 tional Park Service, became increasingly involved
 in both restoration and preservation. This federal
 and eventual state involvement was accentuated in

 the depression years of the thirties, especially with
 the inauguration in December 1933 of the Historic
 American Buildings Survey.28 In his Lost Examples
 of Colonial Architecture (New York: William Hel-
 burn, 1931), John Mead Howells emphasized, as

 The Colonial Revival 119

 the colonial constituted America's only meaningful
 historic tradition worthy of preservation.

 Fiske Kimball pointed out in his introduction, "the
 depth of our artistic and historic loss." There were
 several ways of preventing these losses. Henry
 Ford started out in the twenties with preservation
 in situ of the historic Wayside Inn in Concord,
 Massachusetts. In a short time he took the Wil-
 liamsburg approach one step further, and in his
 Greenfield Village (along with the adjacent Edison
 Institute) at Dearborn, Michigan, he created his
 own version of the ideal colonial village. Ford's vil-
 lage was composed of historic buildings moved to
 the site and new buildings designed in the colonial
 image. The Edison Institute was housed in replicas
 of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Congress
 Hall, and old City Hall. And Ford's commitment to
 the colonial continued through the decade. Dear-
 born Inn, the hotel serving Greenfield Village, was
 designed in 1939 as a small colonial village, com-
 posed of replicas including the Edgar Allan Poe
 cottage, the Patrick Henry mansion, the Oliver
 Wolcott house, the Barbara Fritchie house, and the
 Walt Whitman farmhouse. In the same year, Ford,
 through the Ford Foundation, sponsored Spring-
 field Park near Dearborn, and the imagery of the
 single-family houses and the groups of apartments
 in this development were appropriately colonial.29
 It is fascinating to see how historic preservation
 efforts throughout the country were almost exclu-
 sively concerned in the late twenties and the thir-
 ties with the colonial image (whether factual or
 created). While some Hispanic monuments were
 restored and rebuilt in Florida, Texas, New Mex-
 ico, Arizona, and California, the interest even in
 these regions, as far as domestic architecture was
 concerned, was directed to what was perceived as a
 continuation of the eastern colonial tradition in the

 As had occurred in the past, the colonial images
 of the thirties emerged as something specific to
 that moment. And, as one would expect, what
 finally came about in 1940/41 was in many ways
 different from what existed in 1930o. In this decade
 there was an intriguing set of seemingly opposite
 demands which were played off against one an-
 other. The serenity and suggestion of formality of
 the classical tradition were quite often contrasted
 with the picturesque and informal, both in the
 forms of the building and in the relationship be-
 tween the building and its site. The puritanism of
 the primitive and the vernacular of the early colo-
 nial or of the Cape Cod cottage was quite the oppo-
 site to the urban sophistication of versions of the
 federal or Greek-revival types of the thirties. The
 atmosphere of "correct" and "accurate" scale and
 detailing was in many instances played off against
 the "free renderings" of the colonial types. Ele-
 ments of the "modern" (high art and streamline
 moderne) were either gently absorbed into the co-
 lonial image or contrasted with it. The colonial
 types of the thirties found it easy to embrace the
 new and fashionable spatial ideals of the time: the
 open, informal plan, the tight vertical and horizon-
 tal circulation links, the opening up of the interior
 to the exterior through extensive glass windows
 and doors, and the connection of interior living
 areas to the exterior through porches and terraces.
 The kitchen and the bathroom of the colonial
 house were approached exactly as they were in any
 modern or moderne-image dwelling of the time: as
 highly workable "machines for living."

 early and mid nineteenth century. In New Mexico
 it was the Angloized adobe, the territorial style,
 with its Greek-revival/late-federal overtones; in
 California, it was the Anglo-Monterey style and the
 California ranch house. A perusal of the pages of
 Lewis Barrington's Historic Restorations of the Daugh-
 ters of the American Revolution (New York:
 Richard R. Smith, 1941) gives the impression that

 A pervasive quality in the thirties was to design
 objects and buildings in modest, small scale. The
 architects' or builders' version of the colonial cot-
 tage, or even the larger two-story early New En-
 gland colonial house, represented a reduction in
 size from its equivalents in the 1920os. In architec-
 ture this reduction in size and apparent luxury of
 detail may be seen as a reaction to budget limita-
 tions caused by the depression; but this trend was,
 in essence, symbolic. By the end of the decade,
 when an upper-middle-class man felt that he could
 go ahead and build a new house, the cost of such a
 dwelling was some 40 percent less than it would
 have cost to build a similar dwelling at the end of
 the twenties.3s Reduction in size and simplification

 of detail were due to social factors, a more retiring
 life-style, changes in the size of families, and the
 way in which people wished to see themselves and
 to be seen. The romantic, idealized, rugged, and
 simple colonial past of the seventeenth and eigh-
 teenth centuries provided the perfect vehicle for
 this symbol of modesty and reticence. To realize
 this idealized past, the colonial image, even in free-
 rendered forms, must have an authentic ring. The
 building should rest closely on the ground; the
 pitch of the roof and its eave and cornice line
 should be correct in relation to the width and
 height of the wall surface; the windows (double-
 hung or, in seventeenth-century examples, case-
 ments) should be properly scaled with the appro-
 priate divisions of lights; paneled doorways,
 fireplace mantels, and stair and other details
 should be based on historic precedent; and every-
 thing should contribute to a sense of delicate and
 intimate scale.

 emerged with some changes, and a new designa-
 tion, the "Early American Farmhouse Style," came
 into vogue. Other shifts in the terminology of
 types, as well as visual and symbolic emphasis, in-
 cluded the substitution of "Pennsylvania farm-
 house" for "Philadelphia colonial" and the increas-
 ingly close association of the designation
 "Georgian" with English Georgian prototypes, or
 with the eighteenth-century Georgian of Mary-
 land, Virginia, and above all, of course, Williams-
 burg. "The Williamsburg Restoration," wrote Wil-
 liam Cantor Halprin, of the Westchester County
 Society of Architects in 1938, "will doubtless accel-
 erate the movement toward the Georgian style as
 the public becomes familiar with the enduring
 charm and dignity of that period."32

 Other colonial types more pervasive than the

 Colonial Types: The House

 While authentic types (or as they were more often
 than not referred to by architects and the lay
 public, styles), such as the "New England colonial,"
 the "Cape Cod cottage," and the "Pennsylvania co-
 lonial," were characteristic of the thirties, it is obvi-
 ous that there were innumerable variations, and
 there never was, of course, any accord on what
 terms should be used to describe this or that type.
 In 1925, in a series devoted to architectural images
 of the time published in Country Life, Henry Hum-
 phrey, Jr., suggested that there were six colonial

 types then prevalent. These were the New England
 colonial, the Dutch colonial, the Philadelphia colo-
 nial, the southern colonial, the Georgian, and
 finally, a "Free rendering of the Colonial Style."
 The use of these terms to describe types continued
 into the thirties with occasional modifications and
 elaborations.3 The type that Humphrey had
 labeled the "Free rendering of the Colonial Style"

 Georgian that dominated the thirties' scene were
 the Cape Cod cottage, the early New England
 (medieval) colonial, the classic New England colo-
 nial box, the Greek revival, and the federal style
 (often labeled regency). Added to these were re-
 gional versions of the colonial: the Caribbean (Ber-
 mudian) colonial, which became popular in Florida
 and along much of the gulf; the New Orleans style;
 the territorial Pueblo revival in New Mexico; the
 Monterey and ranch house in California; and the
 Pacific Northwest's own version of the colonial, a
 picturesque mixture of colonial, earlier craftsman,
 and medieval period-revival designs of the 192os.
 All these colonial types, including the regional
 variations, had occurred in the 192os, but they did
 not rise to prominence until the next decade.33

 At the opening of the thirties, Marcia Mead set

 down the varying colonial types then in vogue in
 an issue of the American Institute of Architects'
 Small Home magazine; at the end of the decade,
 Frederick M. Wells indicated how these earlier
 preferences had been expanded to include the
 Greek and regency modes.34 If one were to chart
 the national preferences for the colonial house

 be found in Normile, New Ideas. The Architectural Forum Book of
 Small Houses (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1938), p. xxxiv,
 divided the colonial into five types: Dutch colonial, Cape Cod,
 Georgian, southern colonial, and American farmhouse.

 If one can suggest a time when the Cape Cod

 types of the thirties, they would, on the basis of
 popularity, be arranged as follows: (1) Cape Cod
 cottage, (2) early American farmhouse, (3) early
 New England colonial, (4) Pennsylvania colonial,
 (5) New England colonial box, (6) Georgian, (7)
 regency (federal), (8) Dutch colonial, (9) Williams-
 burg version of the Georgian (Wrenesque), and

 style.""6 And World War II did not diminish its
 preeminence on the American scene. In 1949 the
 editors of the Architectural Forum devoted two long
 articles to the Cape Cod cottage and its influence
 on contemporary architecture. They reluctantly
 admitted, "twentieth century America's most
 popular house design, now scattered throughout
 the entire country, is the Cape Cod Cottage ...
 Seldom has one house design achieved such uni-
 versal popularity with builders and homeowners
 alike."37

 Chamberlain wrote: "A nice thing about the
 Cape Cod cottage is that its lines can be adapted
 perfectly to a new house, fitted with every modern
 comfort without any incongruity. The prefab-
 ricated 'machine-to-live-in' has a potent rival in the
 Cape Cottage." And when New York architect Al-
 fred Easton Poor published Colonial Architecture of
 Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, he indi-
 cated in his foreword two reasons behind his study:
 "First, to make a record of the houses of our ances-

 colonial began its rapid ascendancy to popularity,
 it was probably in 1932 when the gold medal in the
 Better Homes of America's Small House Architec-

 tural Competition was won by Wills. His winning
 design, the 1931 cottage for Maurice A. Dunlavy in
 Brookline, Massachusetts, while not really tradi-
 tional in plan, exhibited all the essential hallmarks
 of this colonial type-it was a one-and-one-half-
 story cottage, sheathed in various widths of white
 clapboard, with a central, high, massive chimney,
 "correctly" proportioned and broken-up double-

 tors before time and 'modernization' take too great
 a toll from existing examples. Second, to show the
 beauty that these houses achieved through simplic-
 ity and straightforward plan, in the hopes that it
 may be an inspiration to those who are now build-
 ing our smaller houses, and to those who feel the
 unique value of the 'Cape Cod House' as a distinc-
 tively American contribution to Architecture."35
 By 1940 there was no question that "the over-
 whelmingly popular image in the country" was the
 Cape Cod cottage (fig. 5). In the Ladies' Home Jour-
 nal, Richard Pratt reiterated what was common
 knowledge: "that prospective small house owners
 predominantly prefer the Cape Cod Colonial

 tage," Ladies' Home Journal 57, no. 5 (May 1940): 78-79. The
 editors of American Home devoted an issue (20o, no. 3
 [September 1938:25-44]) to a "Portfolio of 16 Small Colonial
 Homes." These 16 designs provide a good cross section of the
 colonial types that were being built in the mid 1930s. In addi-
 tion, various agencies of the federal government promoted the
 Cape Cod cottage as a solution to the low-cost, single-family
 house (Federal Housing Administration, Technical Bulletin no.
 3 [Washington, D.C., June 15, 1936]). A similar position was
 taken in "The Low Cost House," Architectural Forum 72, no. 4
 (April 1940): 211-22.

 hung windows, and even the essential white picket
 fence surrounded by hollyhocks (fig. 6).38

 Although the Cape Cod came to be synony-
 mous with Wills's designs of the thirties, there were
 many other architects who employed the image
 with equal success. Among these were Charles S.
 Keefe, Jerome R. Cerny, Cameron Clark, Gordon
 Allen, James Gamble Rogers II, and Perry, Shaw,
 and Hepburn, all of whom fashioned highly con-
 vincing Cape Cod images.39

 great popularity in the twenties, the Dutch colo-
 nial, continued into the thirties. In 1938, when the
 Architectural Forum published its Five Star Ques-
 tionnaire, 6o percent of those polled preferred the
 colonial image, and of these some 30 percent indi-
 cated their fondness for the Dutch colonial. What

 Another story-and-a-half type that had enjoyed

 water story-and-a-half house was used by Perry,
 Shaw, and Hepburn as a basis for their House and
 Garden Williamsburg House Number 2 of 1927
 (fig. 7).

 In the thirties there were, in addition to the

 pure Cape Cod cottages, a variety of one- or one-
 and-one-half-story buildings at Williamsburg that
 provided the sources for many designs, including
 the Raleigh Tavern, the Pitt-Dixon dwelling, the
 Purdie dwelling, the Captain Orr dwelling, the
 Blair house, and others.40 The form of this Tide-

 is surprising with this sort of enthusiastic response
 is how few of these colonial types were designed
 and built. There were a sprinkling of gambrel
 (which in some cases could possibly be read as
 Dutch) spec-built houses constructed and a few ar-
 chitect-designed houses, but the number of Dutch
 colonial houses constructed in the 1930s remained
 small.41 The Dutch colonial types built in the thir-
 ties were distinct from those of the previous de-

 The theme of a colonial cottage composed of
 various parts loosely attached to one another, in-
 timating that they might have been added at vari-
 ous moments in time, was a frequently employed
 image. As a design, such colonial cottages played a
 variety of visual games. Their essential cottagey
 form suggested charm and humbleness, although
 in fact they often contained square footage that
 beguiled their apparent small size. They often con-
 trasted a general picturesqueness against segments
 of the design that were quite formal; in their interi-
 ors, for example, space and detailing were often
 treated in a formal fashion. That the ideal of the

 large house as a colonial cottage did not die out in
 the depression can be seen in an extensive country
 house designed by John W. Stedman, Jr. (figs. 9,
 io). Needless to say, the normal 1930s colonial cot-
 tage seldom approached such upper-middle-class
 ideals. Much more typical of the time was Fen-
 wick W. Wall's small house at West Islip, Long
 Island (fig. 11).

 Akin to the informal, pieced-together Cape
 Cod cottage were numerous informal, two-story
 colonial dwellings which were referred to simply as
 colonial and at other times as the "American farm-

 house type," or "modified colonial."43 The design
 approach taken in this colonial type was strongly
 affected by the fashion in the twenties for rural
 English (the Cotswold cottage) and French (Nor-
 man farmhouse) medieval forms. The rambling
 quality of these American versions of the Euro-
 pean vernacular satisfied both the desire for the
 picturesque, a suggestion of the classical, and the
 need to embrace the latest functional spatial needs
 of the period. In such designs garages could be

 xxix-xxxv. For some historic New England examples of gam-
 brel-roof cottages which were used as sources by architects, see
 Albert G. Robinson, Old New England Houses (New York:
 Charles Scribner's Sons, 1920o). The plates in this volume are
 not numbered. The author illustrates examples from New Bed-
 ford and Dedham, Mass. (the wing of the 1636 Fairbanks
 house), and from Windsor, South Lyme, East Lyme, Litchfield,
 and Hadlyme, Conn. Examples of eighteenth-century Virginia
 story-and-a-half cottages were published in the Measured
 Drawings of Early American Architecture series in Architectural
 Record 63, no. 1 (January 1928): 81-88; 63, no. 6 (June 1928):
 585-92; and 67, no. 6 (June 1930): 587-90. Other photo-
 graphs and measured drawings were published in American Ar-
 chitect 143, no. 2617 (May 1933): 69-70; and 147, no. 2637
 (September 1935): 57-64-

 Garden Homes Costing Less than $7,500,"' Ladies' Home Journal

 cades (fig. 8). The Dutch colonial of the teens and
 the twenties was in most instances a two-story
 dwelling, which by a minor (sometimes actually
 false) maneuvering of the gambrel roof was made
 to pass as a one-and-one-half-story dwelling. In
 most cases the front and rear shed-roof dormers

 end up occupying almost the entire roof area of
 these houses. In the thirties the ideal Dutch colo-

 nial looked more closely to the original historic ex-
 amples in New York and New Jersey. These de-
 signs were to be seen (at least from the street) as
 story-and-a-half cottages. Small, separate, gable-
 roof window dormers replaced the twenties' broad,
 single, shed-roof dormers, and the roof frequently
 exhibited its historically correct upward bend at
 the eaves. Other "correct" details entered: win-

 dows of proper proportion and broken into small
 lights, paneled shutters, occasional use of stone
 sheathing, and other features.42

 easily integrated into the houses; the kitchen, ser-
 vice area, stairs, and entry could be gathered to-
 gether as a tight circulation/utility core; and in-
 door/outdoor living requirements could be fully
 realized. Many of the architects who employed the
 colonial image in the thirties essentially then co-
 lonialized the plan and picturesque disposition of
 these 192os period revival medieval images, an ex-
 cellent example being Roger H. Bullard's own
 house in Manhasset, Long Island (fig. 12).

 When handled by Mecaskey and other Phila-

 delphia architects, the image always had a strong
 ring of regional authenticity. When carried else-

 where the Pennsylvania farmhouse type became
 looser, although still successful as a colonial image.
 Next to Philadelphia and its environs, Los Angeles
 (notwithstanding the strange logic) emerged as the
 second home of this colonial type. Although a
 number of Los Angeles-area architects, including
 John Byers and Edla Muir, H. Roy Kelley, and
 Welton D. Becket, designed this colonial type, it
 was Beverly Hills architect Gerard Colcord who
 became its most effective spokesman. His houses
 had "the sturdy character of a fieldstone and clap-
 board Pennsylvania Farmhouse . . . even the

 thickly wooded setting looks Pennsylvanian" (figs.
 14, 15).45

 Yet another colonial type which was looked
 upon with fondness in the 1930s was the seven-
 teenth-century, two-story, early American house
 of New England, often referred to as a "garrison
 house." Like the Cape Cod cottage, the simplicity
 and suggestion of rugged puritanism evoked by
 this image had a great appeal during the depres-
 sion. Henry H. Saylor, writing in 1935, asked,
 "What is there in this extremely primitive house of
 the seventeenth century that holds so strong an
 appeal to us of this sophisticated generation?" Say-
 lor's answer lay in the symbolism of this colonial
 type: "Here are the enduring fruits of our
 forefather's efforts to build honestly, sturdily,
 without ostentation." Some fifteen years earlier
 Murray P. Corse had argued, "The present day
 offers an excellent occasion for such a revival ...

 tury homes of our Puritan ancestors?" "Appreciat-
 ing the widespread interest in Early American
 home life," wrote the editors of Ladies' Home Jour-
 nal in 1932, "the Journal commissioned a Boston
 firm of architects to reproduce the American ar-
 chitecture of 1650 in such a manner that it can be
 enjoyed today, with our much changed mode of
 living" (fig. 16).46

 As was the case with the thirties' Cape Cod cot-
 tage, Wills was closely associated with this "au-
 thentic" early American type. In the 1933 Better
 Homes of America competition, he received an
 honorable mention for a saltbox version of the

 early American type, in the Ordway house at New-
 ton Center, Massachusetts (fig. 17). Externally this
 house appears so authentic that most of us would

 and where can we find a better inspiration for
 dignified simplicity than in these seventeenth cen-

 a straight-forward and eiconomical plan." Earlier,
 in 1 921, Dwight James Baum carried the argument
 for this colonial type into the realms of aesthetics

 and folk architecture: "The interest in the earlier
 house lies in the splendid outline and careful
 studied proportioning of windows and door open-
 ings to the solid mass of plane wall surfaces. They
 (the carpenter/builders) achieved an unconscious
 relation of parts and proportion of opening to wall
 space and even glass divisions. . . . Some of the
 crudities of design add a certain quaintness that
 would be lost by a refinement of design." As one
 would expect, this New England colonial image
 was used on many occasions by Wills, Will Rice
 Amond, and Baum, as well as by other architects,
 particularly in the Northeast (figs. 18, 19).47

 With the depression, the number of large- to
 medium-size dwellings built in the more formal
 and often sumptuous colonial Georgian style de-
 creased substantially, and when they were built the
 general inclination was to turn to the earlier, sim-
 pler phase of the Georgian, or to the styles that
 followed the Georgian. In truth, much of what was
 referred to as Georgian in the 1930s would, to be
 historically correct, be designated as English re-
 gency or American federal. But despite the eco-
 nomic effects of the depression, there was a scat-

 Of all the colonial types, the two-story New En-

 gland rectangular box, usually sheathed in white-
 painted clapboard (or painted shingles) with
 louvered, shuttered, double-hung windows and
 covered by a gabled roof, has been the most persis-
 tent in this century. Ethel B. Power was thinking of
 this New England type when she suggested, "a
 large degree of the popularity of the Colonial
 house is due to its economy of construction.... It is
 usually contained within a rectangle; it has a sim-
 ple, often unbroken roofline; ... in addition it has

 ages most admired in the thirties were those associ-
 ated with Williamsburg and Tidewater Virginia.48
 The largest of these Georgian, Williamsburg-
 inspired houses was Jerome Robert Cerny's 1940

 nor's Palace at Williamsburg (fig. 2o).

 through its plain surfaces, two-dimensional detail-
 ing, and simple volumetric forms, be responded to
 as modern (figs. 21, 22, 23)-

 As early as 1919 Baum had written "Bringing

 Colonial Architecture Up to Date," and in 1934 he
 noted that the "house of tomorrow ..,. will recall in

 a fresh manner the architecture of our own Greek

 Revival, the English Regency or the French Direc-

 In 1933 the fashionable New York store W. and
 J. Sloane sponsored a Fifth Avenue demonstration
 house in the regency style. "But why was the Re-
 gency Style chosen? Because it is a traditional type
 of architecture that lends itself to modern adjust-
 ments; because it is one of the two architectural
 styles-the other being its first cousin, Greek Re-
 vival-that are destined to enjoy great popularity."
 When in the same year Rexford Newcomb pub-
 lished his volume on how to build a colonial house,

 he designated the federal style as something quite
 distinct from the earlier phases of the colonial.49 In
 glancing through the pages of America's middle-
 and upper-middle-class home magazines of the
 thirties, it is apparent that the regency as a colonial
 type was thought of as a nearly perfect combina-
 tion of three ideals of the time: the sense of return-

 ing to the colonial past; the desire to be suave and
 sophisticated via a highly refined version of classi-
 cism; and the urge to have an image that could,

 toire." Of these early nineteenth-century classical
 forms, it was the American Greek revival that came
 to intrigue Baum. In a scheme he published in
 1940, the proportions of the house and the pitch of
 the roof are Greek, but the strongest Greek feature
 is the Doric-columned pergola which stretches
 across the face of the house (fig. 24).5o This design
 illustrates how few the historic references need to

 cates how inventive one could be with this colonial

 type.

 Colonial Image and Regionalism

 One of the intriguing aspects of the thirties' colo-
 nial revival that sets off this phase of the colonial
 revival from that of the past was its ability to estab-
 lish a series of repeated national images found
 coast to coast but at the same time to encourage the
 development of regional types. In each instance
 the unspoken desire was to develop an image that

 would be tied to the national colonial tradition but
 Florida's West Indies colonial. Richard Koch's

 at the same time would be responded to as specific
 to the locale. The five geographic areas where this
 regionalism most strongly asserted itself were in
 Florida, along the Gulf Coast (closely associated
 with New Orleans and Louisiana), in New Mexico
 and the Southwest, in California, and in the Pacific
 Northwest.

 Donald Markle house (1936) at Pass Christian, Mis-
 sissippi, was, like the Alexander house in Palm
 Beach, oriented around a two-story living veranda;
 it bespoke New Orleans rather than Palm Beach by
 its general French colonial atmosphere conveyed
 by the high-pitch hipped roof and the detailing of

 Florida, like California, had been a center in
 the late teens and on through the twenties of the
 Spanish colonial revival and Mediterranean styles.
 But the Spanish/Mediterranean tradition which
 had been seized upon with lust by Addison Mizner
 and others fell out of favor at the end of the twen-
 ties, as rapidly as it had quickly ascended. In the
 midthirties the editors of House and Garden noted,
 "Florida is now undergoing a reaction from the
 florid houses of Latin ancestry toward more con-
 servative design"; Louis Capron wrote in House
 Beautiful in 1935, "Tropical Colonial is supplanting
 the Spanish," and he entitled one of his articles
 "Revolt at Palm Beach."5' In the thirties the clients

 and architects of Florida did seek out a great deal
 more restrained sources, and these, as one would
 expect, led away from the open picturesque ro-
 manticism of the Hispanic/Mediterranean to the
 visual discipline of the classically inspired tradi-
 tions. While there were a few "correct" Georgian
 houses built in Florida in the thirties, the "Geor-

 gian" most often used was inspired by that of Ber-
 muda and the British West Indies (fig. 25).52

 On a national level, the regionalism of New Or-

 leans was closely associated with the many-tiered
 iron balconies of buildings within the city's Vieux
 Carre district. But some of the most interesting
 interpretations of the Mississippi delta "colonial"
 architecture shared many points in common with

 51 "Palm Beach Architecture Now Goes Conservative,"
 House and Garden 68, no. 4 (October 1935): 40. While this asser-
 tion is true for traditional architectural imagery in Florida, one
 must remember that both Florida and California became by
 1940 major strongholds of popular streamline moderne design.

 (September 1935): 30-33, 84-85.

 52 Examples of the Georgian in Florida in the 1930s would
 be Maurice Fatio's 1937 house at 822 S. County Rd., Palm
 Beach, in Barbara D. Hoffstot, Landmark Architecture of Palm
 Beach (Pittsburgh, Pa.: Ober Park Assn., 1974), p. 192; and

 the veranda (fig. 26).53

 One of the persistent twentieth-century strong-
 holds of American regionalism has been New Mex-
 ico. In the early decades of the century, Anglo
 easterners, who had settled in Albuquerque, Santa
 Fe, and Taos, intermixed their efforts at historic

 preservation with a desire to create a style based on
 the historic amalgamation of the Pueblo Indians of
 the Rio Grande valley and the Spanish. The Pueblo
 revival was the result of this effort, and eventually
 this architectural image was employed for building
 types ranging from gasoline service stations,
 motels, and spec houses to public buildings. Not-
 withstanding the vigor of this regional style in the
 decades of the twenties and thirties, it, like the
 Spanish/Mediterranean revivals of Florida and
 California, was slowly nudged into the colonial.
 The regional colonial source was New Mexico's
 own territorial style of the mid nineteenth century:
 an amalgamation of Pueblo, Spanish, and Anglo.54
 The colonial elements of the territorial (loosely
 derived from a late provincial version of the fed-
 eral and Greek revivals) usually consisted of a dec-
 orated brick coping for the parapeted adobe walls,
 occasionally gabled roofs, wooden double-hung
 windows with accompanying louvered shutters,
 and pedimented window frames and other ex-
 terior and interior detailing in milled lumber (fig.
 27). Colonial-inspired territorial revival houses of
 the thirties were built throughout the Southwest
 from Texas to Arizona and on into California. As a

 regional colonial type, the territorial was presented
 in builders' pattern books, and it occurred as spec
 housing both before and after World War II.

 In 1929 Martha B. Darbyshire wrote of the
 California scene: "Today, Spanish architecture is
 either dead or fast dying. The reason is plain
 enough. It was not as practical and suited to the
 American [Anglo] idea of everyday living as it was
 attractive to the eye." The implicit superiority of
 the Anglo tradition, expressed through colonial
 architecture, is revealed by one of those who initi-

 ated the Monterey revival, Pasadena architect Gar-
 vin Hodson. "Thus there was created," he wrote,
 "this delightful composite of New England and
 Spanish Colonial which seems to have combined so
 completely the advantages of solid comfort and
 good taste"-the "solid comfort" being the His-
 panic ingredient, and "good taste" the Anglo. The
 colonializing of California's Hispanic/Mediterra-
 nean tradition of the teens and twenties produced
 two closely related regional types-the Monterey
 and the California ranch houses. Los Angeles ar-
 chitect Roland E. Coate observed of this adaptation
 in the late twenties: "A new kind of house has ap-
 peared in California, and in a few short years has
 succeeded in establishing itself.... It represents an
 attempt to apply familiar Colonial forms to mod-
 ern conditions in California, [and] ... blended with
 this there is a suggestion of the Spanish style which
 is inevitable in this country which is so rich in its
 tradition from Spain."55

 Supposedly the colonial Monterey style of the
 thirties was modeled after two-story balconied or
 porched houses built in California's coastal cities
 from the mid i83os on through the 1850s.56 But in

 Like most terms designating a fashion, a style,

 or an architectural type, "California ranch house"
 had been in use since the 189os. By the early 1930s
 the term came to be narrowed and applied to in-
 formal, somewhat rambling, single-floor dwellings,
 which, like the Monterey revival house, seemed to
 be based on a nineteenth-century mixture of the
 Hispanic and the Anglo.57 As with the Monterey,
 the trend in the thirties for the California ranch

 house was to reduce slowly the Hispanic aspect of it
 and to increase its colonial qualities. Harold O.
 Sexsmith's 1936 Townley house in San Marino il-
 lustrates the version of the California ranch house

 that was to enjoy nationwide popularity after
 World War II (figs. 29, 30).

 From the teens of this century to the present,
 the Pacific Northwest has provided an unusual

 Northwest was not on the whole based on the nor-

 mal premise of regional-that of historic prece-
 dent; rather, it was a cultivated response to the
 mountainous, woody environment of the coastal
 areas of Oregon and Washington (figs. 31, 32). In
 the thirties, the Pacific Northwest architects and
 clients sought out some sort of an argument of
 history to substantiate their interest in the colonial.
 Portland architect Glenn Stanton, writing in 1938,
 referred back to "the simple Colonial style of the
 houses built [in the Willamette valley] from about
 1865 to 188o.... [Q]uite a few show a feeling of
 the Greek Revival, others are finer in scale-a
 translation of style in the old home states. These
 early examples here influenced, in a limited way,
 the domestic designs of the architects, who have
 found in their simplicity and rugged character, a
 fair answer to the requirements of our climate."58

 The Colonial Revival 141

 Colonial: Commercial and Public

 Since the twenties, the colonial image, often as a
 version of the colonial house, had been used for

 commercial buildings from large office complexes
 to the smallest roadside restaurant. For larger
 buildings, the colonial precedent tended toward
 mid eighteenth-century Georgian. The smaller
 buildings ranged more broadly through colonial
 history, from the early eighteenth century up
 through the federal style after 18oo. As in the de-
 sign of the house, there was a movement in the
 thirties toward a preference for the later colonial--
 the regency or federal-and there was a general
 desire to modernize-that is, to incorporate mod-
 erne elements. Those who commissioned auto-

 mobile-oriented drive-in architecture in the thir-

 ties-service stations, restaurants (fast food and
 otherwise), motels, and the like-sensed that the
 colonial provided an appealing advertisement.59

 From the late twenties on, the new parkway sys-
 tems laid out in and around New York provided
 service station/restaurants and rest stops that were
 rural and colonial. National and regional oil com-
 panies designed prototype stations which, with
 their white walls, shuttered windows, and correctly
 detailed wooden trim, read as small colonial dwell-

 ings. Fast-food outlets, like Howard Johnson's and
 the Dutchland Farm Restaurants, played the usual
 late thirties' game of presenting themselves as both
 colonial and modern (fig. 33).6o

 Colonial retail and office commercial build-

 ings-some conveying an authentic feeling, others
 loose in image-occurred from Maine to Califor-
 nia. These ranged from good-size developments
 such as Palmer Square (completed in 1941) in
 Princeton, New Jersey, "the largest collection of
 new buildings in the Colonial style outside of Wil-
 liamsburg," to Paul R. Williams's elegant Music
 Corporation of America Building in Beverly Hills
 (1940), seemingly a Georgian country house set in
 its own colonial garden (figs. 34, 35).61

 Turning to public buildings, churches, and
 educational buildings, the preferred colonial types
 in the thirties continued to reflect the twenties' pre-
 dilection for eighteenth-century American Geor-
 gian. Whether it was a small post office in a mid-
 western town (fig. 36), a school in New England
 (fig. 37), or a collegiate building in the Pacific
 Northwest (fig. 38), the characteristic design was a
 red brick structure whose facade presented a bal-
 anced composition, accentuated usually by small-
 pane windows, central ornamented entrances, and
 the roof surmounted by a cupola and spire. The
 prototype sources were often elements borrowed
 from eighteenth-century churches or from such
 historic monuments as Independence Hall in Phil-
 adelphia or the Colony House in Boston.62

 Both officially and unofficially the federal gov-
 ernment was committed to the colonial. This was

 America, Beverly Hills, Calif., 1940. From Architect and
 Engineer 141, no. 3 (June 1940): 18.

 federal post office buildings-in each case to in-
 sure that they turned out to be colonial designs.63
 The general course of design for public build-

 ings in the thirties is revealed in two Clark projects:
 his 1931 Bryan Memorial Town Hall, Washington,
 Connecticut, and his 1936/37 restoration and addi-
 tions to the 1794 Town Hall, Fairfield, Connecti-
 cut. The Bryan Town Hall, with its sumptuous,
 two-story, columned and gabled portico, poses as a
 restrained but formal Georgian design (fig. 39). In
 contrast, the remodeled and added-to, wood-
 sheath Fairfield Town Hall stands, as Talbot Ham-
 lin observed in 1938, "in perfect simplicity-a New
 England Town Hall" (fig. 40).64

 an image dear to the heart of Franklin Delano
 Roosevelt, both before and during his long presi-
 dency. Whether at Hyde Park or the White House,
 he liked to play the part of the gentleman-
 architect-being particularly fond of seeing him-
 self associated with Thomas Jefferson. In the area
 around Hyde Park along the Hudson, he inter-
 vened on a number of occasions in the design for

 Conclusion

 "A few fortunate souls," wrote Samuel Chamber-
 lain in 1937, "possess genuine Cape Cod cottages,
 authentic, unspoiled ones. ... Most of us, however,
 must be content with a modern interpretation, and
 it is fortunate for us that the true flavor of Cape
 Cod, perhaps minus the salt atmosphere, can be
 captured by a sympathetic observation of a few pe-
 culiarities of its cottages." For the architect of the
 thirties to discover and maneuver these pecu-
 liarities, it was observed in the Architect and En-
 gineer, "he must have a spirit of humility. He must
 instruct himself that certain elusive but enduring
 qualities in buildings of the past have caused them
 to have the same allure now as in the beginning. It
 is a part of his culture to search out these elusive
 and enduring qualities so that to the full extent of
 his ability such qualities may also be built into his
 architecture."''65

 The colonial revival of the thirties, as was the
 case in the twenties, indicates how successful tradi-
 tionalism could be in solving and expressing sym-
 bolic and functional needs of the day. The mod-

 ernists claimed that they were the only ones who
 could properly symbolize and deal with the mate-
 rial, political, and social needs. Yet with the mod-
 ernist roots in the world of the architect-as-artist

 and art for art's sake, they found it very difficult to
 compete effectively with traditionalism, which to a
 considerable degree was based on "a spirit of
 humility."

 If we grant the essential premise of tradi-
 tionalism-the need for continuity, the desirability
 of maintaining an image that could be read at vari-
 ous levels by a broad audience-then it is apparent
 that the colonial revival in the thirties was remark-

 ably creative and vigorous. The "allure" of the
 original colonial buildings of the seventeenth
 through early nineteenth centuries was indeed
 captured in the work of the revival's principal ex-
 ponents. If we look back to the work of Royal
 Barry Wills, Dwight James Baum, Cameron Clark,
 and others, it is apparent that they achieved the
 transformation of the historic colonial into an im-

 age highly expressive of the decade.

 Answers have already been suggested to several
 of the questions posed in the early part of this dis-
 cussion. Of these, certainly the key question re-
 volves around the reasons for the prominence of
 the colonial in the thirties. It would be a mistake to

 attribute its popularity to one single cause. The

 implication of inward-searching nationalism, while
 a highly significant ingredient, was only one of sev-
 eral reasons for the widespread fondness for the
 colonial. The suggestive powers of architecture to
 remind us of past values-in this case, of a simpler,
 puritanical, family-oriented world of manageable
 scale-was implicit in the thirties' view of the colo-
 nial past. To these explanations must be added
 three others: practicality, sentiment, and aesthetic
 predilection.

 veying a feeling of historic accuracy, and simulta-
 neously of realizing the functional needs of the
 time, and finally the desire to have the image en-
 compass the modern in a casual, easygoing fash-
 ion. This game can be observed in examples that
 came close to appearing as almost "pure" repro-
 ductions, as well as openly modernized colonial
 designs.

 In 1946, shortly after the end of World War II,
 the editors of Life conceded with reticence that
 Wills was the American architect whose colonial

 structures and parts to reinforced concrete. For
 smaller buildings, particularly wood-frame and
 -sheath dwellings, the colonial almost always
 turned out to be one of the most economical build-

 ing types of the time.

 As previously discussed, not only were there
 specific historic types of the colonial that came into
 prominence in the 1930s, but there was a process
 of continual change in the interpretation of these
 types, and there was a continual absorption of the
 modernist image. By the end of the decade, there
 were commercial and public buildings and dwell-
 ings that could be responded to either as modern-
 ized colonial or as modern with a slight nod to the
 colonial. The unique and significant contributions
 to the "time-honored" tradition of the colonial in

 should be."66 The editors of Life (with their associa-
 tion with Architectural Forum) were by this time out-
 and-out exponents of the modern, and their
 phrase "sentimental American ideal" was used in
 the negative, critical sense-for in serious modern
 buildings there was certainly no place for drippy
 sentimentality. Sentiment, and specifically middle-
 class sentiment, was (and has remained) one of the
 essential bases for the popularity of the colonial,
 past and present. In open contrast to the modern-
 ist, traditionalists had always argued that sentiment
 was an essential ingredient of architecture and that
 instead of attempting to ignore it, the architect was
 under obligation to understand it and expose it.

 In the same 1946 article on Wills, Life noted
 that while his Cape Cod cottages and other colonial
 designs did not have the appearance of "machines

 objects. They correctly pointed out how well-
 conceived were his plans, how carefully he took
 into account current building technology and the
 life-style of the middle-class family. If we examine
 the siting and the plans of colonial revival build-
 ings in the thirties, from small four-room cottages
 to large public buildings, it is clear that their ar-
 chitects were as objective and rational in their anal-
 ysis of functional considerations as any modernist
 of the day.

 Continuing from the late twenties into the thirties

 To mention the principal domestic landmarks
 of the colonial revival in the 1930s is not an easy
 task, for such a list would be extensive, and geo-
 graphically the examples would span the country.
 While a number of these colonial domestic land-

 wrote frequently on architecture and the decora-
 tive arts in the thirties, pinpointed the aesthetic
 reasons why the colonial was so popular in the thir-
 ties: "They possess a common denominator of
 simplicity, sturdiness, sincerity and later of dignity
 and directness." "At its best," she concluded, the

 marks were good-size suburban or country houses,
 by far most were modest, middle- or upper-
 middle-class suburban dwellings. Because of the
 quality of design of so many of the colonial cot-
 tages and houses of the thirties, it is difficult to
