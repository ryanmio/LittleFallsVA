 In the early 178os, Thomas Jefferson castigated the design

 of Williamsburg's early Georgian buildings.5 Yet in later
 years he came to appreciate non-architectural values in

 eighteenth-century structures. In 1825, when a Philadelphia

 antiquarian, Dr. James Mease, asked where the Declaration

 of Independence had been written, Jefferson identified a

 brick house on Market Street. Ignoring its lack of architec-

 transmitted unbroken."' For James Russell Lowell "patri-

 otism, the love of country," was the force that led him to

 speak in favor of the preservation of Old South Meeting

 House in 1877. Like many of his generation, Lowell (born in

 I819) could not accept a Colonial building as "a model of
 architecture ... in any aesthetic sense." Rather, Old South's

 importance lay in the fact that it had "looked upon great

 men and great events," and so had the power to "lift our

 minds to a higher level of feeling."'

 The simplistic view that Colonial architecture was American

 architecture did not meet with universal acceptance. There

 were those who recognized, to varying degrees, its indebted-

 ness to England. Henry Cabot Lodge, scholar and Senator

 from Massachusetts who was simultaneously a patriot and

 Anglophile, insisted in a speech before the national conven-

 tion of the A.I.A. in 1907 that "Old Colonial forms" were

 "so agreeable" because the colonists "did not merely imi-

 tate ... something which had no connection with its sur-

 was a farmhouse near Sudbury, Massachusetts, that was

 over a century old when purchased by the architect about

 1910.63 In 1913 Cram considered several new Colonial

 houses that showed a careful study of regional Colonial

 styles, "notable work redolent of race."64 For Cram, Colo-

 nial architecture was good not because it was American, but

 because it had English origins. Thus he said of Harvard's

 eighteenth-century architecture: "English it was, of course,

 so far as we could make it, for we were all English-or rather
 British-in bone and blood and tradition down to half a

 roundings. . . ." Instead, "they tried to apply forms which

 century ago."65

 had been tested elsewhere in a way to make them represent

 the New World."56 Colonial architecture might derive from

 English sources, but Lodge believed that it was transformed

 in America, acquiring its own character.

 Frank E. Wallis, an early student of the Colonial,57 did not

 claim that the colonists had altered Georgian forms in trans-

 porting them from England. He simply maintained that

 Strangely enough, Cram's archrival in the struggle of
 Gothic vs. Classic, Charles McKim, had a similar under-

 standing of the subservience of American to English Geor-

 gian, at least when speaking before a British audience, the

 R.I.B.A., in 1903. He remarked that "precisely the most in-

 teresting, and in their sphere the most admirable, architec-

 tural monuments of my native land . .. are those that most

 while "we must accept the English Georgian parentage, this

 strongly recall their English prototypes."66

 Georgian or Colonial happens to be the only style ... which

 the colonists understood or desired. That this period of ar-

 chitecture was interwoven in our fabric of free government

 ... must prove ... that Colonial is our national style of
 architecture."s58

 Ralph Adams Cram approached Colonial architecture as

 an ardent Anglophile and Gothic Revivalist. He labored

 under the assumption that America was still an English

 colony without European ties: the English and Americans

 "are one people, with one history and one blood." Conse-

 quently, English Gothic "is the work of our own race... our

 own inalienable heritage."''59 Cram was incensed by the very
 idea of French influence-in the form of Beaux-Arts classi-

 cism-on American architecture: "blood will tell, and does

 good, red English blood take kindly to the argot of the

 Quartier" ;60 or again, "we are English; neither French, nor

 Italian; therefore let us not sell our birthright for a mess of-

 potage du jour!"561

 Cram's firm designed residences, schools, and churches

 following American Georgian models,62 and his own home

 Others went out of their way to deny the Americanism of the

 Colonial. The important critic Mariana Griswold Van Rens-

 selaer recognized that there was, in 1886, a school of thought

 which held that Colonial buildings should be faithfully re-

 produced, because they were "the only examples at once

 'American' and good." She admitted that certain Colonial

 roof types and methods of wooden construction did not

 have English or European sources, and that Colonial struc-
 tures were "identified with whatever historic associations

 we can call our own." Still, she concluded that the Colonial's

 "patterns were all imported." Only "the wigwam of the

 North and the pueblo of the South" were truly "Ameri-
 can."67

 The New England antiquarian Samuel Adams Drake de-

 nied that new Colonial buildings had any connection with

 American tradition. In his opinion, the Colonial Revival

 merely resulted from the fact that architects ("those inde-

 fatigable purveyors of public caprice") had run out of new

 sources "after ransacking the whole earth," and were now

 happy to find a new style ripe for plunder in their own

 country. New Colonial houses were rising everywhere; ap-

 parently the "old colonial was . .. a fetich before which our

 national pride loves to prostrate itself." But Drake believed
 that "reverence for the shadow"-new Colonial structures

 -was "a vicarious atonement for our sins against the sub-
 stance"-genuine old landmarks. Drake was appalled by
 the destruction of such historic shrines as the Hancock man-

 sion (Fig. i), which, before its demolition, had "taught his-

 tory; . . . awakened patriotic aspirations; . . . stimulated

 honest endeavor. .. ."68 Colonial Revival houses, on the
 other hand, had no associations and so nothing to teach.
