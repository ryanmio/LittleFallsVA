 White Ethnogenesis and Gradual Capitalism:
 Perspectives from Colonial Archaeological Sites
 in the Chesapeake

 ABSTRACT The piecemeal development of capitalist socioeconomic systems in the colonial Chesapeake was deeply intertwined

 with projects of white ethnogenesis. Crafting a sense of "groupness" along lines perceived as racial required free "whites" to remain

 economically and socially interdependent. A variety of strategies and material forms-including reciprocal exchanges, hall-parlor house

 plans, and earthfast construction-facilitated this cohesion. Such integrative tactics coexisted in colonists' behavioral repertoires with

 more "capitalistic" strategies that prioritized private profit over social obligation. Colonists' deployment of diverse social strategies reflects

 a complex calculus assessing the benefits of economic autonomy against the benefits of ethnic ("white") solidarity. These dynamics can be

 illustrated through an 18th-century archaeological site at Flowerdew Hundred in the Chesapeake. [Keywords: ethnogenesis, capitalism,

 and cultural systems has aptly been characterized

 T HE EMERGENCE OF CAPITALIST social, economic,
 as the most pervasive global change of the last half mil-
 lennium (Little 1994). Although the broad strokes of its
 global development are fairly well understood, less appar-
 ent are the means by which this multifaceted transforma-
 tion emerged "on the ground," or how and why the charac-
 ter, sequence, and pace of capitalism's appearance differed
 among localities (Wallerstein 2004:x). By taking a "jeweler's
 eye view of large-scale causal processes specific to capitalism
 as they operate in particular contexts" (Leone and Potter
 1998:116), historical archaeology permits glimpses of its
 emergence as varied and dependent on local circumstance.
 Region-specific analyses expose modern conditions as prod-
 ucts of human ingenuity, bringing "back into focus places
 and time periods in which entrenched categories were still
 in flux and contested, crystallizing around an organizing
 common sense that had not yet covered its tracks" (Leone
 1999:9).

 Traces of capitalist systems "under construction" ap-

 pear in patterns of material culture, land use, and social
 interaction in the Chesapeake region of Virginia during the
 17th and 18th centuries. For purposes of the current analy-
 sis, capitalism can be understood as a set of socioeconomic
 strategies that prioritize private profit, individual auton-

 omy in investment decisions (Harris 1999:164), and the
 creation of wealth (Wallerstein 2004:23-24). In the Chesa-
 peake such strategies coexisted with other socioeconomic
 tactics that placed greater emphasis on the integration
 of individuals and families into communities. Most colo-

 nial planters eschewed communal forms of land tenure
 familiar from England, for example. Their commitment
 to private property reflects a preference for economic de-
 tachment from the community, and their focus on soil-
 depleting but potentially lucrative crops reveals an in-
 terest in profit maximization. Simultaneously, however,
 colonial Chesapeake planters remained integrated socially
 and economically through reciprocal exchanges. Their fa-
 vored house types-expedient and wooden-required own-
 ers to call regularly on local craftsmen, and the open
 floor plans they chose facilitated visiting that often in-
 volved the exchange of goods. These practices reflect
 socioeconomic tactics that existed with, yet differed in
 key ways from, private profit-driven models of decision
 making.

 Why did Chesapeake colonists not extend the capital-
 istic models they employed in some domains to a wider
 range of decisions about material culture, economic re-
 sources, and social interaction? Although individuals' use
 of diverse strategies was, and is, doubtless common in

 communities throughout the world, the complexity of Vir-
 ginia planters' socioeconomic tactics is significant for the
 light it sheds on processes of white ethnogenesis. I sug-
 gest that the emergence of capitalist socioeconomic systems
 in the Chesapeake region was piecemeal: For many resi-
 dents, developing a sense of ethnic identity as "white"-in
 part through cultivating connections to others understood
 to be of European descent-was more desirable than thor-
 oughly extricating themselves from socioeconomic obliga-
 tions to one another. The projects of establishing race as a
 primary social fact and of establishing "the white race" as

 profoundly different from others depended on a sense of
 white cohesiveness. This solidarity, in turn, relied on inte-

 grative systems of exchange among Euro-Virginians. Thus,
 in the colonial Chesapeake, the development of racial iden-
 tities slowed the development of capitalism as local expres-
 sions of international transformations.

 Bell * White Ethnogenesis and Gradual Capitalism 447

 The view of whites as being "nonraced" infiltrates

 much modern anthropological scholarship, including that
 within historical archaeology (Orser 1998). In this disci-
 pline "to say that one is interested in race has come to
 mean that one is interested in any racial imagery other
 than that of white people" (Dyer 2003:301), especially that
 of African Americans (Paynter 2001:125). Prominent stud-
 ies of white ethnicity are tellingly set in Massachusetts
 (Paynter 2001) and Appalachia (Horning 1999), areas be-
 yond the pale of slavery's heartland. Although enslavement
 existed to a limited extent in these regions, the construction
 of white ethnicity within plantation systems such as those
 of the Chesapeake has gone largely unexamined (Mullins
 1999:189). The ways in which whiteness emerged there gen-
 erally "worms out of critique" (Hill 2004:7). By denying an-
 alytical attention to white ethnogenesis, archaeologists are

 complicit in making whiteness invisible and seemingly nat-
 ural (Jones 1997:1-13). Ignoring "white ethnicity," archae-
 ologists help "to redouble its hegemony by naturalizing it"
 (Roediger 2002:327).

 Whiteness is not the absence of race; white is a

 In this study, I consider the articulations between cap-
 italism and ethnicity in the Chesapeake beginning with
 an explanation of the term white ethnogenesis as it applies
 to the 17th-century social landscape. I then consider and
 compare characteristics of capitalism with other socioeco-
 nomic strategies in England and Anglo-Virginia. Domains
 in which a partial development of capitalist orientations
 appear in the Chesapeake include settlement patterns,
 socioeconomic exchange, and domestic architecture. An
 early-18th-century archaeological site at Flowerdew Hun-
 dred illustrates these trends and their relationships with the
 development of racism. As the site's handmade ceramics
 suggest, it was in the context of regular interethnic contact
 that landowners used material culture, especially domestic

 color, and its emergence as a social phenomenon mer-
 its consideration (Dyer 2003:306). The " 'white race'-
 supra-class unity of European-Americans in opposition
 to African-Americans" almost certainly did not exist in
 17th-century Anglo America (Allen 1994:162; cf. Sobel
 1987). Ethnic identities are socially negotiated rather
 than objectively established, and in the early colonial
 Chesapeake such identities had not yet been reified
 (Franklin and Fesler 1999). Individuals of African, Native
 North American, and European heritage interacted in
 any number of ways (Sobel 1987). In the 17th-century
 Chesapeake, "blacks and whites drank, caroused, and for-
 nicated together"; in addition, interracial marriages con-
 tinued to occur into the 1660s (Berkin 2003:13; Morgan
 1975:327). Early on, some African Virginians successfully
 pressed their legal claims for freedom, becoming well-to-do
 planters (Berlin 1996:276-279) with indentured European
 through which people of diverse social statuses, from var-
 servants working their lands (Berkin 2003:13). In this

 from people they considered to be of African or Native
 American descent. Researchers have often applied the term

 architecture, to forge a sense of sameness among "whites"
 and a sense of difference from "people of color."

 The terms whiteness and white ethnicity refer to the means

 ethnogenesis to processes of social definition among subal-

 terns positioning themselves "within and against a general
 history of domination" (Hill 1996:1). White ethnogenesis in
 colonial Anglo-America-the creation of "whiteness" as an
 ethnic identity and privileged social category-has received
 less scholarly attention. The frequent conceptualization of
 African Americans and others as "racial" but of European
 Americans as "normative" (Hartigan 1997:501) or as "just
 human" has rendered "whiteness" an unmarked category
 (Hill 2004), at least from the perspective of many white peo-
 ple (Frankenberg 2001). As Toni Morrison once observed
 of a Hemingway character, "Eddy is white, and we know
 he is because nobody says so" (1993:72). In the work of
 Hemingway and many other U.S. writers, race is usually
 only marked for nonwhite characters.

 nic identities "on the ground" comprised two transactions:
 (1) internal definition, creating a sense of cohesion or
 "whiteness"; and (2) external differentiation, generating a
 belief in difference from others (Jenkins 1997). Whereas a

 mid-17th-century observer might have perceived a hypo-
 thetical crowd as containing gentlemen immigrants from
 London, merchants from Glasgow, Virginia-born gentry
 planters, indentured servant "girls" from Bristol, and peri-
 patetic Irish laborers, an observer in the 18th century might
 see "white" people, only later making discriminations based
 on class, occupation, or other social factors (cf. Fredrickson
 2002:53). This change in thinking required not only the
 establishment of distinction between European Virginians
 and African or Native Americans ("white" vs. "nonwhite")

 but also the manufacture of a sense of coherence among the

 diverse members of this new category of "whites" (Kulikoff
 1986:44).

 Acts of "othering"-fostering a conviction of "white"
 people's distinctness from "colored" others-depended, in
 part, on legal changes enacted over the course of several
 generations (Epperson 1999:160-172; Smedley 1993). The
 first use of the term white to refer to people appeared in
 a 1691 miscegenation law, which forbade any "English or
 other white man or woman being free" to marry "any ne-
 groe, mulatto, or Indian man or woman bond or free"
 (Epperson 1999:160). As they began recognizing "whites" as
 a distinct and superior social group, legislators instituted in-

 creasingly stringent codes that restricted the rights of non-
 whites but enhanced those of whites of all economic levels

 (Morgan 1975:311-312). Late-17th-century laws sought to
 prevent "that abominable mixture and spurious issue which

 hereafter may encrease in this dominion, as well by negroes,

 mulattoes, and Indians intermarrying with English, or other

 white women, as by their unlawfull accompanying with one
 another" (Morgan 1975:334-335). The distinction was be-
 tween legally "intermarrying" and unlawfully "accompa-
 nying with one another" (the latter phrase referring to ex-
 tramarital relations and reproduction). Lawmakers sought

 to prevent association both within and outside of wedlock.
 The 1705 code of Virginia decreed that no white servant
 should be stripped to be beaten and that blacks could no
 longer testify against whites (Sobel 1987:45). In 1723, the
 Virginia Assembly issued a law providing that "no free ne-

 gro, mulatto, or indian whatsoever, shall have any vote at
 the election of burgesses, or any other election whatsoever,"
 an edict that the governor hoped would "fix a perpetual
 Brand upon Free Negros & Mulattos" (Allen 1994:240-241).
 Such measures encouraged Virginians of every ethnicity
 to distinguish habitually between "whites" and all others
 (Morgan 1975:329).

 Material culture also appears to have played diverse,
 fundamental roles in processes of racial definition. As anal-
 yses below suggest, changes in manor houses' floor plans
 and in the location of laborers' quarters underscored social

 differences between bondspeople and planters (cf. Epperson
 1999:160-172). Simultaneously, the small wooden houses
 planters usually opted to build facilitated intimacy in visit-
 ing among peers, enmeshed house owners in local networks
 of maintenance and exchange, and downplayed differences
 in wealth among European Americans. These measures
 likely fostered a sense of white similarity or "groupness."

 Cultivating an ethnic social cohesiveness was almost

 possess the "agent of one's own demise" (Hall 2000:40).
 Although African Americans were present in other North
 American colonies, they often composed a small propor-
 tion of the population. Estimates put the 18th-century en-
 slaved population in Massachusetts, for example, at only
 one to two percent (Greene and Harrington 1932:12-19;
 cf. Brown and Trager 2000:113; Paynter 2001). Thus, de-
 mographic ratios and the slave-dependent economy of the
 colonial Chesapeake likely encouraged white planters to
 view solidarity among themselves as desirable.

 Euro-Virginians' selective deployment of capitalist
 strategies in social and economic decisions makes sense
 in this light. By sacrificing some forms of autonomy, they
 gained ethnic solidarity. I now discuss what I mean by cap-
 italism and how it differed from more socioeconomically

 integrative strategies. I also hope to illuminate the relation-
 ship between "capitalism" and "racism" as these new con-
 cepts developed in the colonial Chesapeake.

 CAPITALISTIC AND INTEGRATIVE STRATEGIES

 In early modern England, custom and law acknowledged
 communal obligation in the production of food. In this
 economy, the growing and milling of grain

 were principally social rather than economic activities.
 ... The farmer who grew it... did not really own the corn;
 he attended it during its passage from the field to the
 market. He could not store it in order to wait for a more

 propitious moment of sale; he could not move it to a
 distant market.... Rather, he must load up his carts with
 his grain, proceed to the nearest market, and offer his
 year's harvest to his traditional customers. Similarly, the
 miller and the baker were constrained to push the grain
 processing along in an orderly fashion to its final form
 as a loaf of bread selling at a price set by the local assize
 court. [Appleby 1978:27]

 During the 17th century, changes were accelerating in

 England and its colonies. In the Chesapeake, social expec-
 tations entailed in food production waned as agriculture
 became defined primarily as an economic activity driven
 by individual acquisitiveness. Robert "King" Carter, one of
 colonial Virginia's wealthiest planters, revealed the impor-
 tance of individual profit when he suggested that he would

 have "lived at a very little purpose if I cannot get as much
 for my tobacco as other men" (Hudgins 1990:68). English
 immigrants to Virginia were often "drawn by a commit-
 ment to their own advancement and a belief that land, la-

 certainly desirable because many Chesapeake planters
 were economically reliant on enslaved African Americans.
 Depending on the particular time and place, enslaved peo-
 ple composed between 24 and 58 percent of the 18th-
 century Virginia population (Greene and Harrington 1932:
 137-143). In some locales, "white" Virginians were in
 the minority (Greene and Harrington 1932:156). Although
 large-scale uprisings were rare, "Many slave owners cer-
 tainly believed such rebellion to be a constant possibility"
 and were aware that to hold a person in bondage was to

 bor, and tobacco opened the way to wealth" (Billings et al.
 1986:53).

 In this respect, Chesapeake planters' cultural orien-

 tations can be characterized as capitalistic. Definitions of
 capitalism are famous for their variability, with much de-
 bate about the distinctive features of capitalism and about
 whether an economy dependent on the labor of enslaved
 people, rather than wage laborers, can aptly be character-
 ized as "capitalistic" (e.g., D. Bell 2002:129; Marx 1990:
 151-152; Robinson 2004; Sanderson 1995:138-139). In this

 debate, Immanuel Wallerstein's position on capitalism is
 useful both because of the centrality it grants to the profit
 motive-a point on which most thinkers agree-and be-
 cause of its applicability to the colonial societies under dis-
 cussion. Following Wallerstein (2004:23-24), capitalism is
 here understood as a set of socioeconomic strategies, or
 "cultures of livelihood-making" (Herzfeld 2001:113), that
 sublimate social obligation to individual autonomy and
 the pursuit of private profit (cf. Marx 1990:254). In this
 light, capitalism and slavery are compatible. The "capital-
 ist world-economy is built on the endless accumulation of

 capital. One of the prime mechanisms that makes this pos-
 sible is the commodification of everything"-including hu-
 man beings as "labor" (Wallerstein 1988:5; cf. Sanderson
 1995:140). Agents employing capitalistic socioeconomic
 strategies generally act to increase private profit rather
 than to acknowledge social obligations (Glassie 2000:28-
 29; Johnson 1996:7-10). Because exchanging goods and la-

 bor informally within community networks can compro-

 mise efficiency and profit, individuals often withdraw from
 webs of economic interdependence (Larkin 1988:1-61).

 community's influence (Appleby 1978:58). Whatever views
 particular people held about the injustice or even sinful-
 ness of enclosure, "All were agreed that private farming
 yielded more than farming in common" (Appleby 1978:60).
 Facilitating the accumulation of private wealth, enclosure

 disentangled individuals from webs of community obliga-
 tion (Glassie 2000:105; Johnson 1993:165-170). The "per-
 sistent consciousness of a common fate faded" when sep-
 arate farms were established and decisions about land use

 passed from members of a village to members of a family
 (Appleby 1978:59).

 The institution of separate farms took hold early and
 firmly in the colonial Chesapeake. Despite economic in-
 centives, few towns emerged in Virginia and settlements
 remained "much more diffuse than in New England" or
 England (Walsh 1988:202; cf. Horn 1994:139). Planters scat-
 tered widely to claim the maximum amount of land on
 which to grow tobacco, the region's soil-depleting cash
 crop, and often located their homes in the center of their
 properties to ease "a planter's daily movement back and
 forth across his several tobacco fields" (Kelly 1979:202). Sep-

 In some ways, Chesapeake colonists exhibited capitalist

 arate farms maximized agricultural efficiency and profitabil-

 strategies, as in the example of planters like "King" Carter.
 These freeholders used their property for personal rather
 than for the community's benefit. On closer inspection,
 however, other aspects of colonial Chesapeake planters' be-
 havior appear to have been informed by alternate sets of
 values, as they used a variety of reciprocal means to remain
 interconnected socially and economically. The coexistence
 of these strategies emerges clearly in patterns of land use
 and exchange.

 ity for individual householders.

 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EXCHANGE

 IN THE CHESAPEAKE

 If capitalistic ideals informed colonial landowners' pref-
 erence for separate farms, the logic supporting other
 customs-visiting neighbors and employing earthfast
 building methods-appears to have emanated from other
 strategies that integrated families in community networks.
 Colonial Chesapeake planters were famous for the amount
 of time they spent in one another's houses (Isaac 1982:70-
 72). A 17th-century visitor to the region claimed, "People

 Coming from a variety of backgrounds and regions, English

 immigrants to the Chesapeake were familiar with a range
 of settlement patterns including hamlets, single farm-
 steads, and nucleated villages with surrounding open fields
 (Hoskins 1955). Nucleated villages containing between 12
 and 50 households were especially common. Residents of
 these nucleated villages vested land management in mem-

 bers of the village and adhered to interhousehold decisions,
 "which governed rotations, the limits on the numbers of
 animals, and the times of planting and fencing of grazing
 land" (Dyer 1997:144). Even in places where nucleated vil-
 lages did not prevail, a degree of collectivity generally re-
 mained in the sharing of pastures and regulations of grazing
 (Dyer 1997:146).

 Expectations of communal activity were changing dur-
 ing England's colonization of Virginia in the 17th century.
 Many people were "improving" agricultural land by ditch-
 ing, draining, irrigating, and, above all, enclosing it. From
 a legal perspective, enclosure entailed the end to common
 land rights; in practice, it involved fencing and hedging
 tracts for private use; and economically, it signaled a fam-
 ily's intention to conduct its activities independent of the

 spend most of their time visiting each other.... When a
 man has fifty acres of ground, two men-servants, a maid
 and some cattle, neither he nor his wife do anything but
 visit among their neighbors" (Walsh 1988:233). In the
 18th century, George Washington likewise recalled that "for

 twenty years his family never once dined alone" (Talpalar
 1960:229). Visiting involved the exchange of time, goods,
 and labor: "Neighboring families relied heavily on each
 other for aid in their work, for borrowing back and forth
 when supplies ran low or the proper tools were lacking,
 and simply for conversation or sharing important personal
 and family events" (Walsh 1988:206). These exchanges ob-
 ligated freeholders to each other in ways seemingly at odds
 with the desire for distance expressed by their decision to
 farm independently.

 The coexistence of independent and integrative strate-

 gies appears clearly in domestic architecture. Archaeo-
 logical investigation of colonial sites in the Chesapeake
 has shown the near universality of earthfast architecture
 (Carson et al. 1981; Deetz 1993; Deetz 2001). In earth-
 fast or post-in-the-ground structures, builders placed main
 structural posts directly into the soil rather than onto

 House repair generally fell to local planters who were also
 part-time craftsmen (Kelly 1979:203). Even large slavehold-
 ers often looked to free craftsmen for building construction

 and upkeep (Russo 1988:414-427). In this need for recurrent
 maintenance, earthfast architecture obligated householders

 to others (St. George 1983). Many researchers infer that ar-
 chitectural features such as wooden posts were "'designed
 to fail' for social reasons": to generate contexts for exchange
 (St. George 1983:6; cf. Deetz 1996:147-149; Shackel 1998).
 The temporal and spatial associations of earthfast housing
 with complex, multifaceted social relationships suggest that
 this architecture is an archaeologically visible manifestation

 of a social construct in which mutual dependence and inter-

 action were givens. Planters apparently built these houses,

 in part, because relying on other free people to help main-
 tain them was not only feasible but also desirable.

 Earthfast housing therefore exhibits the influence of di-

 verse socioeconomic strategies. In permitting resources to

 be diverted from housing to agricultural production, it ex-
 presses a commitment to profit, just as the establishment of

 separate farms suggests the value of economic autonomy.
 However, earthfast architecture, as well as the custom of

 visiting neighbors, implies the existence of exchange and
 involvement among free community members.

 THE USE OF DOMESTIC SPACE

 Other salient trends in colonial Virginia architecture also
 suggest the coexistence of integrative and capitalistic ori-
 entations. A preferred house plan, the hall-parlor dwelling,
 occupied a position both temporally and socially between
 through-passage and central-passage houses. The earlier
 through-passage house integrated the resident family, labor-

 ers, and visitors. The later central-passage house sequestered
 the family from laborers and visitors alike. The hall-parlor
 form was intermediate in its incorporation of visitors but

 mission.

 foundations (see Figure 1). In the Chesapeake the wooden
 character of these buildings extended from the frame to
 the covering: most colonial houses had wooden clapboards,
 shingles, and chimneys (Wells 1993).

 Earthfast architecture, a "quick and dirty technique" of

 raising a house, reduced initial construction costs (Upton
 1998:152), but even prosperous planters often built, occu-
 pied, and maintained such houses (Kelso 1984:76; Neiman
 1986:299-300). The utility of earthfast architecture for peo-
 ple of diverse means makes sense from a capitalist perspec-
 tive, because reducing housing costs facilitated investment
 in more directly profitable enterprises. Specifically, in the
 colonial Chesapeake, these enterprises centered on the cul-
 tivation of tobacco (Carson et al. 1981).

 Earthfast dwellings required frequent maintenance,

 however, because in the humid Chesapeake hole-set posts
 would rot in roughly a decade (Billings et al. 1986:127).

 its distancing of laborers from the resident family.

 In early modern England and the early colonial
 Chesapeake, multiroom houses often had through-passage
 plans. Archaeologically documented examples in Virginia
 include the circa-1675 manor house at the Clifts Planta-

 tion in Westmoreland County (Neiman 1986:297) and the
 early-17th-century "stone foundation house" at Flowerdew
 Hundred in Prince George County (Carson et al. 1981:182).

 In England, through-passage houses were "everywhere the
 commonest form in houses of more than one cell. In most

 of the country it was universal" (Mercer 1975:50).

 The through passage was a corridor running perpen-
 dicular to the dwelling's long axis, with doorways open-
 ing onto both facades of the house (see Figure 2). This
 passage communicated on one side with the hall and on the
 other with a service space, often a pantry (Mercer 1975:231).
 In these houses, the hall and through passage worked
 centripetally, drawing laborers, visitors, and householders
 together (Johnson 1993:56). Through passages provided
 the primary and sometimes exclusive access to a dwelling.

 and where many and multifarious activities went on"
 (Mercer 1975:19). Typically, family members could only
 reach the parlor by passing through this common area. This
 arrangement

 was of little consequence whilst old relationships lin-
 gered, that is, while many of the workers employed were
 themselves of much the same status as the owner, were
 farmers, sons waiting to take over their fathers' lands, and
 likely to marry their masters' daughters. [Mercer 1975:61]

 Through-passage houses supported the density and inti-
 macy of relationships among members of a householder's
 family and laborers in early modern England.

 During the 17th century, the through passage was los-

 ing popularity in England and its Chesapeake colonies. In
 England, functions long housed in pantries off the through
 passage were increasingly relegated to outshuts, rooms at-
 tached to the rear of houses. By the 18th century, ser-
 vants often occupied separate "cottages" (Mercer 1975:70-
 74). Manor houses now exhibited centrifugal tendencies,
 with laborers working and sleeping in spaces distinct from
 those of the householder's families (Johnson 1993:119).
 This architectural transformation reflects "the long process
 of the exclusion of farmhands from the family's life" (Upton
 1982:50). Housing responded to and helped form a world
 in which the two bore a diminishing sense of social con-
 nection (Neiman 1993:253).

 The separation of family and labor materialized in the
 colonial Chesapeake as hall-parlor houses within plantation
 contexts that contained separate laborers' dwellings along

 with outbuildings such as barns and detached kitchens.
 Among the great majority of the colonial Chesapeake pop-
 ulation, one- and two-room houses were nearly universal
 (Herman 1997:18-37; Upton 1983:268-269). A structure
 with two unequally sized principal rooms, the hall-parlor
 dwelling (see Figure 3) was so regionally common that many
 contemporaries referred to it as a "Virginia house" (Upton
 1986:318). The larger room was the hall: a multipurpose
 living space generally square in plan, heated by a fireplace,
 and communicating with the exterior (Glassie 1975:120-
 122). The parlor was a smaller, less heavily trafficked room.
 It was usually rectangular in plan and often communicated
 only with the hall, an arrangement making it a more private
 space (Deetz 1996:152-164).

 Because hall-parlor dwellings were so small, activi-
 ties requisite to maintaining the household were suffused
 throughout a miscellany of outbuildings (Wells 1993). In
 the Chesapeake, hall-parlor houses functioned as parts of
 dispersed architectural landscapes that included laborers'
 quarters, barns, and detached kitchens. A late-17th-century
 visitor described planters' architectural customs:

 Whatever their rank, and I know not why, they build only
 two rooms with some closets on the ground floor ... but
 they build several like this, according to their means.
 They build also a separate kitchen, a separate house for
 the Christian slaves, one for the Negro slaves, and several
 to dry the tobacco. [Epperson 2001:55]

 Hall-parlor houses and the proliferation of plantation
 outbuildings were key features in a project of social re-
 definition. Although some early-17th-century Chesapeake
 planters had housed laborers in buildings separate from
 the main dwelling (Mouer et al. 1999:108), many others
 had lived with their servants (Neiman 1993:254-261;

 Upton 1982:47-48). By claiming hall-parlor manor
 houses as private domains and assigning laborers-white
 "Christian" or "Negro" slaves-to separate spaces, planters
 made an "audacious assertion of a new relationship"
 (Upton 1982:53). In an act of social extrication, landown-
 ers physically distanced themselves from those who worked
 their plantations (Deetz 1996:147-152). This architectural
 development reflects a move toward the commodifica-
 tion of human beings and the reification of laborers as
 "labor."

 Even as hall-parlor manor houses served to create dis-

 tance between householders and workers, the dwellings
 nevertheless maintained an open floor plan easily acces-
 sible to visitors. In the Chesapeake, beginning in the last
 quarter of the 17th century, entry was usually directly into
 a hall rather than a lobby or baffle entry, as was common in
 New England (Cummings 1979:6-7). Climatic differences
 between the two regions make sense with this architectural
 variation: lobby entries in northerly New England insulated
 the hall, and open forms in Virginia facilitated the circu-
 lation of cooling air. These environmental differences can
 easily be overstated, however, and overly simplified (Baron
 1992:77-78). Colonial observers variously commented on
 the heat of Massachusetts and the chill of Virginia, consid-
 ering the summers of Massachusetts deadly and "extreme
 cold" of the Chesapeake winter unhealthy (Kupperman
 1984:223-235). New England winters and Chesapeake sum-
 mers are insufficient in themselves to account for archi-

 ensembles. These dwellings minimized the presence of
 workers in the hall but maximized the ease of entry
 for peers (cf. Glassie 1975; Mercer 1975:59). Along with
 separate laborer's quarters, hall-parlor houses constituted
 mechanisms both of integration and alienation: promoting
 interaction among peers but encouraging distance between
 owners and laborers.

 Architectural forms allowing householders greater pri-
 vacy from visitors existed in the Anglo-American architec-
 tural repertoire, not only in the form of the lobby entry
 but also in the central-passage house. A central passage
 was a corridor running perpendicular to the long axis of
 a house (see Figure 4). It included the dwelling's front door,
 but rather than separating a hall from service rooms as
 the through passage had, the central passage divided two
 living spaces (Glassie 1975; Upton 1986:317). The central
 passage provided householders a significant amount of pri-
 vacy (Brunskill 1981:43). It permitted access to the par-
 lor without recourse to the hall and acted as a buffer be-

 tween the entry and the living spaces on either side (Pogue
 2001). Architectural historians infer that the central pas-
 sage helped "to declare and maintain the social boundaries
 that separated the planter from his neighbors" (Wenger
 1986:139). If the abandonment of the through passage and
 movement of laborers to separate buildings indicated grow-
 ing distance between house owners and workers, the adop-
 tion of central passages suggests an increasing social dis-
 tance among peers.

 During the 18th century, central-passage houses existed

 in England and its colonies (Chappell and Richter 1997),
 but hall-parlor houses remained popular in Virginia (A. Bell
 2002). Their resilience seems largely attributable to their
 utility in integrating householders into wider networks of

 tectural differences between the two region's predominant
 dwelling plans.

 Social considerations also influenced colonial

 Chesapeake property holders' decisions to build easily
 accessible hall-parlor houses as part of diffuse architectural

 associations through visiting. When more private options
 existed, continuing to build and occupy hall-parlor houses
 can be interpreted as an effort to maintain social ties. Hall-
 parlor houses-like earthfast construction, separate farms,
 diffuse plantation landscapes, and customs of visiting-
 depict colonial Chesapeake landowners as drawing, in part,
 on capitalistic socioeconomic strategies and, in part, on
 more socially integrative modes of interaction.

 from manor house to quarters, repeated continuously across
 the Chesapeake, made the point in both a personal and a
 political way that people of African and Native American
 descent were to be conceptualized as fundamentally differ-
 ent from Euro-Americans: nonwhites as less than human

 (Morrison 1993:71). In this and other ways, processes of
 racial definition transpired in large measure at the house-
 hold level (cf. Wilkie 2001:111). The transfer of laborers

 and whites as simply human (cf. Fusco 1993:37).

 ARCHITECTURE AND ETHNOGENESIS

 This pastiche of strategies gains coherence when consid-
 ered in the context of contemporaneous processes of ethno-
 genesis. Plantation architecture apparently had great utility
 in helping to craft a sense of sameness among European
 Americans and of difference from "others." The virtu-

 ally ubiquitous hall-parlor dwellings, set within ensem-
 bles of outbuildings, reduced laborers' presence in the
 manor house-a distancing that enforced perceptions of
 distinction between householders and workers (Epperson
 1999:56). Domestic segregation that had begun in England
 with the decline of the through-passage plan served, in
 Virginia, to bolster perceptions of racial difference (Upton
 1982:54; cf. Wallerstein 1988). In addition to displacing
 laborers, especially enslaved people of color, from manor
 houses, planters also regularly assigned them to quarters
 visually similar and spatially proximal to agricultural out-
 buildings. This move conflated the labor and residences
 of enslaved people with barns and sheds that housed live-
 stock, crops, and tools. The association encouraged a view
 of African Americans and other nonwhites as literally and
 socially occupying a "territory between man and animal"

 In addition to promoting a sense of ethnic difference,
 domestic architecture also likely worked to encourage an
 impression of similarity among European Americans. Many
 well-to-do colonial Virginians could have built houses on
 foundations with little need for regular maintenance. Their
 opting for earthfast architecture, however, enabled them to
 remain in exchange networks with local artisan-planters;
 they "had" to call on these free neighbors to maintain
 their earthfast dwellings (St. George 1983). The institution
 of visiting among Chesapeake planter families also fos-
 tered a sense of "groupness." Time spent at each other's
 houses constituted a form of gift exchange, and "a gift
 that does nothing to enhance solidarity is a contradiction"
 (Douglas 1990:vii). Visiting represented a significant invest-
 ment of energy, the return on which was the formation
 and strengthening of coalitions among white Virginians.
 Euro-Virginians' favoring of hall-parlor plans facilitated this
 process of social integration. In Massachusetts, hall-parlor
 dwellings generally contained lobby-entries that compart-
 mentalized callers; Chesapeake hall-parlor houses, however,
 regularly lacked such barriers, and visitors moved directly
 into the hall-the "heart and hub of the house" (Deetz
 1996; Mercer 1975:59).

 Small, earthfast wooden houses likely had even fur-
 ther social utility for Chesapeake landowners: They pro-
 claimed group unity and sameness through a lack of con-
 spicuous display. Historical archaeologists have devoted
 significant attention to conspicuous consumption-the cul-
 turally defined excessive, visible, nonproductive expendi-
 ture of resources (Veblen 1994). They have often interpreted

 houses incorporating brick, or exhibiting a stylish facade,
 as residents' means of setting themselves apart from their
 neighbors (e.g., Markell 1994). This interpretation sits un-
 easily against the architectural landscape of the colonial
 Chesapeake's one- or two-room earthfast houses, often with
 wooden chimneys and without plaster or glazed windows.
 Usually the first order of conspicuous consumption is avoid-
 ing "vulgar surroundings, [and] mean (that is to say, in-
 expensive) habitations" (Veblen 1994:24). Houses in the
 colonial Chesapeake likely functioned not as status items
 in competitive displays but rather as "collective objects":
 material forms exhibiting and maintaining ties to a group
 (Riggins 1994:111). Despite real differences in wealth, many
 Euro-Virginians built modest wooden houses. This choice
 foregrounded their similarities and, thereby, played a key
 part in creating a sense of likeness among their occupants
 (Bell 2000:565-566).

 Domestic architecture, thus, aided in creating and sta-

 bilizing a social structure under construction in early Anglo
 Virginia (cf. Douglas and Isherwood 1979:59). Houses can
 be understood as an arena in which Euro-Virginians demon-
 strated that, for them, race trumped class: that all "white"
 people were at least somewhat alike and different altogether
 from "blacks" and "others." In the colonial Chesapeake,
 small wooden dwellings composed an important part of the
 "armature of domination" (Wolf 2001:357).

 The various strands in this reading of Virginia's so-
 cial past come together at and are effectively illustrated
 by an early-18th-century archaeological site at Flowerdew
 Hundred, in Prince George County. This Chesapeake site ex-
 hibits salient characteristics of colonial Virginia architecture
 and social patterning, including the complex suite of cap-
 italistic and integrative strategies that many planters used.
 Artifacts the site yielded, particularly handmade ceramics,
 also suggest the multiethnic social milieu in which planters
 appear to have weighed the benefits of economic autonomy
 against the benefits of white solidarity.

 cupation during the first half of the 18th century (Deetz
 1993:108).

 The structure was a 30-by-16-foot earthfast building

 with eight main structural posts on ten-foot centers. The
 dwelling's long axis ran east-west, its eastern gable end fac-
 ing the James River. Two posts immediately outside the east-
 ern end of the building's southern wall suggested an entry.
 A pair of posts on the western end of the building marked
 a bulkhead entrance to a wood-lined cellar. On the east, a
 smaller cellar abutted a brick hearth base and wooden chim-

 ney. Planking must have covered these cellar holes that,
 given their size, would have spanned much of the space on
 the dwelling's principal floor. For this reason, and because
 the western cellar itself had a wooden floor that survived

 archaeologically, the entire dwelling likely had a wooden
 floor. Excavators also found interior wall plaster and leads
 from casement windows (Deetz 1993:108-109).

 Flowerdew Hundred, a 1,000-acre plantation on the James
 River in Prince George County, Virginia (see Figure 5), con-
 tains dozens of sites that range in date from the Archaic
 through the 20th century (Deetz 1993). The domestic site
 of interest here, 44PG98 Feature 35 (see Figure 6), consisted

 of post holes and post molds, two cellar holes, and the re-
 mains of a hearth (Deetz 1993:106-107; Franklin and Bell

 1995). Analysis of artifacts excavated from these contexts
 (Bell 2003) confirms that the site saw its most intensive oc-

 footprint is inconsistent with characteristics of a through-
 passage dwelling. None of the main options for chimney
 placement in a through-passage house position it on an
 exterior wall, the location of the chimney in the Feature
 35 house. Neither does this house exhibit characteristics of

 central-passage or lobby-entry structures. Its doorway was
 on the eastern end of the southern facade, meaning that
 the door could not have opened into a central passage bi-
 secting rooms on either side. Likewise the door did not abut
 a centrally positioned chimney, as would be the case with a
 lobby-entry house. The asymmetricality of Feature 35's plan
 supports the inference that it was a hall-parlor house. The
 eastern end containing the exterior doorway and hearth
 was the hall, whereas the western room was a more private

 parlor.

 The two-room plan and small size of the Feature 35

 manor house imply that many of the functions needed to
 maintain the household took place in a variety of outbuild-
 ings. The area around Feature 35 is littered with the remains
 of other architectural and ancillary features. Some of these
 features postdate the earthfast dwelling, and others are con-
 temporary with it (Deetz 1993:104-106). These include a
 2.5-foot-square pit located approximately 35 feet northwest
 of the earthfast dwelling and filled during the third quar-
 ter of the 18th century (Bell 1994). Although archaeological
 testing of this area was too limited to confirm the pit's func-
 tion, its size and contents-including straight pins, buttons,
 marbles, and ceramics-are typical of subfloor pits found in
 laborers' houses throughout the Chesapeake (Kelso 1984).
 Feature 35 undoubtedly resembled the vast majority of its
 contemporaries and successors by comprising part of an en-
 semble of plantation buildings.

 floors, wooden shutters or oiled paper rather than glazed
 windows, and plasterless interior walls (Neiman 1986:297;
 Wells 1993:5). Its refinements indicate that, at least at some
 point in its use life, this dwelling was a manor house and
 not laborers' quarters.

 Documentary sources identify the property's own-

 ers as members of the interrelated Limbrey and Wilkins
 families (Gregory and McClenny n.d.:1-4) and indicate
 that this dwelling was the seat of a 350-acre planta-
 tion (Deetz 1993:102), a holding of medium size in the
 early-18th-century Chesapeake (Carson et al. 1981:170).
 The Limbreys and Wilkinses occupied economic posi-
 tions below the gentry but above many free Virginians,
 and certainly above thousands of bound laborers in the
 Chesapeake. Because the Feature 35 dwelling was the cen-
 ter of a separate farm, its owners could independently make
 decisions about land use. Documents also indicate that

 their property was part of a patchwork of parcels owned
 by members of an extended kin network (Beaudry n.d.). At
 Flowerdew, much of the "ownership history is a complex
 web of family relationships, and the majority of the prop-
 erty transfers followed kinship lines" (Deetz 1993:60).

 This site illustrates early-18th-century Chesapeake pat-

 terns in additional ways, demonstrating the complexity of
 socioeconomic strategies its owners employed. First, archi-
 tectural amenities such as plaster and wood flooring reveal
 that its residents were well-to-do but nevertheless chose to

 build an expedient earthfast dwelling. On the one hand,
 this decision reflects an interest in profit maximization
 seemingly consistent with capitalistic orientations, as re-
 ducing the initial outlay for house construction permitted
 investment in income-generating ventures. On the other
 hand, this architecture reveals a communal orientation in

 its need for regular maintenance, usually provided by free
 craftsmen-planters (Carr 1988:350-351). Second, the settle-

 ment pattern at Flowerdew Hundred reveals the influence
 of both capitalistic and communal ideals. The owners' de-
 cision to establish a separate farm suggests leanings toward
 familial separateness; yet, at the same time, they were inte-
 grated through kinship ties to households throughout the
 local area. Finally, the hall-parlor plan of Feature 35 eased
 visitors' entry to the dwelling and, thus, facilitated family
 members' connections with their social peers, but it also
 reduced the presence of laborers in the manor house.

 Both negative and positive evidence indicate that the
 Feature 35 dwelling had a hall-parlor plan. Its archaeological

 This at least is the narrative that analysis of domes-
 tic architecture and settlement patterns suggests. Other

 artifacts recovered at Feature 35, however, complicate this
 interpretation. Specifically, handmade ceramics suggest a
 greater degree of contact between house owners and la-
 borers, and among people of different ethnicities, than the

 planters' hall-parlor house indicates. The presence of these
 ceramics in a manor house reveals that the hall parlor in
 the colonial Chesapeake was to some extent an expression
 of desire rather than a reflection of accomplished reality
 (Mullins 1999).

 1999; Singleton 1999:10). Still other researchers maintain
 that conceptualizing the colonial Chesapeake population
 as being divided into three ethnic compartments misrep-
 resents the complexity of its social landscape (Epperson
 1999:160) and spuriously "segments a culturally plural so-
 ciety" (Singleton and Bograd 2000:8). This last interpreta-
 tion is consistent with the understanding, noted above,
 that in the early colonial Chesapeake ethnic identities
 were nebulous and that the social status of African Amer-

 icans relative to others was largely "indeterminate" (Allen
 1994:178).

 Relationships between Native and African Americans

 Fill from the cellars at Feature 35 yielded a total of 288 ce-
 ramic sherds, including English and German types such
 as tin-glazed earthenware, Westerwald, and Staffordshire
 slipware (Bell 2003). Most sherds, however (n = 197 or
 68 percent), were low-fired, unglazed, handmade earthen-
 wares (see Figure 7). Many exhibit treatments such as cord
 marking and net impressions consistent with local Native
 American ceramic traditions (Egloff and Potter 1982). Other
 sherds have characteristics such as everted rims and bur-

 were often so complicated that some contemporaries
 claimed no distinction existed between the two. Hoping
 to dispossess the Pamunkey Indians of their land during
 the 19th century, for example, petitioners argued that the
 territory was reserved for American Indians but occupied by
 African Americans: "The claim of the Indian no longer exists

 ... his blood has so largely mingled with that of the negro
 race as to have obliterated all the striking features of Indian

 nishing that would lead many scholars to characterize them
 as colonoware: a hand-built, "low-fired, unglazed, smooth-
 surfaced earthenware with quasi-European vessel forms,"
 and with features such as flat bases and handles (Henry
 1992:1).

 Much research has focused on identifying the ethnicity
 of colonoware's makers and users. Ivor Noel Hume (1962:4-

 5) initially surmised that colonoware "was manufactured by
 local Indians who were exposed to European influences" for
 use by enslaved Africans. Innumerable archaeologists have
 since joined the discussion about colonoware. Some favor
 the hypothesis that Native Americans were colonoware's
 primary producers (Henry 1992; Mouer et al. 1999; cf.
 Ferguson 1992). Others assert that the ware's creators were
 more likely African Americans (Deetz 1993; cf. Emerson

 extraction" (Johnston 1970:276-277). The Pamunkey Indi-
 ans' counterclaim acknowledged "that there was a Negro
 element among them but they assert[ed] that all of the tribe

 are persons of more than one-half Indian blood" (Johnston
 1970:277).

 Several scholars (Henry 1992:151-156; Mouer et al.
 1999:85-86) have identified colonoware sherds unearthed
 in a 19th-century trash pit on Pamunkey Reservation as
 compelling evidence that Native Americans created the pot-
 tery. However, the apparently complex heritage of many
 Pamunkey Indians suggests that we should view the pottery
 as having deeply interethnic roots. Colonoware represents
 "a process of interaction" (Singleton and Bograd 2000:6),
 a "synergistic development" emerging from the interaction
 of African, Anglo, and Native Americans (Joseph 2002:220).

 plies a separation of property owners and laborers that
 ceramics reveal to be a fabrication, more of a desired ar-

 which racial categories now entrenched lacked coherence

 in this project, including hall-parlor houses, inherently ac-
