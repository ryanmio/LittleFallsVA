 Reassessing the Hallowes Site:
 Conflict and Settlement

 in the Seventeenth-Century
 Potomac Valley

 ABSTRACT

 Located along the shores of Currioman Bay
 in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on land
 patented in 1651 by John Hallowes, the site
 was excavated from July 1968 to August 1969
 by William Buchanan, Jr., Edward Heite, and
 a group of volunteers. Documentary evidence
 directly relating to the site's history was com-
 piled by Virginia Sherman. No written report
 was completed at the time, and no systematic
 inventory was made of the artifacts until the
 1980s. From 2010 to 2012 the artifacts were

 The John Hallowes site in Westmoreland County, Virginia, was
 excavated from 1968 to 1969. No report of the excavations
 was completed at that time, although an article summariz-
 ing the findings was published in Historical Archaeology
 in 1971. The artifacts from the site were not systematically
 cataloged until the 1980s, and it was not until 2010-2012
 that an integrated study comparing the artifact data with site
 features, site history, regional archaeological findings, and
 regional history was completed. Benefiting from nearly 50
 years of advances in Chesapeake archaeology, the reanalysis
 has challenged accepted dates for the site's initial occupa-
 tion, resulted in new interpretations of John Hallowes 's role
 in the Maryland conflict known as Ingle's Rebellion, traced

 on loan to the Department of Anthropology,
 University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for a reex-
 amination of the site as part of a broader study
 of 17th-century settlement of Virginia's Northern
 Neck, the peninsula bounded by the Potomac
 and Rappahannock rivers (Figure 1).

 In an article published in Historical Archae-
 ology in 1971, Buchanan and Heite (1971:39)
 interpreted the site as the "yeoman cottage"
 of Hallowes 's granddaughter, Restitute Whiston
 Steel Manley, one of her sons, or a tenant, and
 dated the occupation from the 1680s to 1716.
 Buchanan and Heite 's excavations uncovered

 political alliances formed during that rebellion that led to the
 creation of the Potomac River community of Appamattucks,
 and examined changing ideas about military masculinity on

 the Chesapeake frontier.

 Introduction

 a house of earthfast construction consisting of
 post holes, associated post molds, and a brick
 hearth, and two large features (Figure 2). Sets
 of roughly rectangular trenches were located at
 the northeast and southwest corners of the build-

 Curated archaeological collections offer impor-
 tant opportunities to reassess the findings of
 past researchers and offer new interpretations
 based on a better understanding of artifact
 types and chronologies, an expanded body of
 comparative data, and current theoretical per-
 spectives. A recently completed reassessment of
 the John Hallowes site (44WM6) is a case in
 point (Hatch et al. 2013). The reassessment has
 resulted in a refined site chronology that chal-
 lenges previous interpretations of the site as an
 example of the response of Virginian colonists
 living in the Potomac River valley to the events
 leading up to and inclusive of Bacon's Rebel-
 lion (1675-1676), and instead situates the site's
 fortifications within the framework of a conflict

 ing, and additional linear trenches extended from
 the building at the northwest corner and along
 the east wall. The trenches were interpreted as
 drains or possibly ditch-set fences (Buchanan
 and Heite 1971:40).

 During the 1970s, Fraser Neiman uncovered
 a fortified house at a nearby plantation known
 as the Clifts (Neiman 1978, 1980a, 1980b). The
 earthfast dwelling, the construction of which
 dates to 1670, was surrounded by a rectangu-
 lar palisade with opposing, circular bastions.
 Neiman (1980a:75) and others have argued that
 this palisade was built in response to conflict
 in the Potomac River valley that contributed to
 Bacon's Rebellion (1675-1676) and identified
 the rectangular trenches at the corners of the
 Hallowes site structure as bastions built to for-

 that rocked Maryland some 30 years earlier.

 (Carson et al. 1981:191; Hodges 1993:205-208,
 2003:509). The recent reassessment, however,
 argues for a new interpretation of the timing
 and purpose of the Hallowes defenses. The
 revised chronology for the site places the con-
 struction of the house at the Hallowes site at

 modern-day Westmoreland County, was created
 in 1648 when the ban on settlement was lifted.

 just after Ingle's Rebellion in Maryland, when,
 between 1644 and 1646, control of that colony
 was seized from the proprietary family (Jonas
 1966:247; Riordan 2004). This earlier conflict
 resulted from internal political animosities and
 divided loyalties brought about by the English
 Civil War, a political crisis that reverberated
 across the Atlantic and directly affected the
 settlement of Virginia's Potomac River frontier.

 Settlement of the Northern Neck

 John Smith initiated English exploration of
 the upper reaches of Chesapeake Bay in 1608,
 arriving on the Potomac River in June of that
 year (Wells 1994:15). The area was home to
 dispersed communities of Algonquian-speaking
 Indians who became important suppliers of both
 foodstuffs and furs to English colonists in the
 years that followed (Wells 1994:17; Rice 2009).
 While trading partnerships emerged, during the
 first four decades of the 17th century the lands
 lying north of the York River and south of the
 Potomac remained contested territory between
 Indians and English settlers from Maryland and
 southern Virginia.

 Rich soils, well-suited for tobacco cultiva-
 tion, were distributed between tributary rivers
 and creeks emptying into the Potomac River
 and Chesapeake Bay in the northeastern por-
 tion of the Northern Neck. Fertile farmland

 At that time, a community known as Chicacoan,
 established near the Coan River in the early
 1640s, became the political center of the new
 county. Within a short time, colonists began
 entering land patents in Northumberland County
 into the official record (Nugent 1934; E. Morgan
 1975:231; McCartney 1990:13).

 English immigrants arrived in large numbers
 in lower York, Rappahannock, and Potomac
 counties during the 1650s and 1660s, many of
 them servants imported to work on plantations
 that produced medium- to high-quality tobacco,
 specifically the Oronoco strain (E. Morgan
 1975:227-228; Walsh 1999:54,59, 2010). By
 1653, the European population of the Northern
 Neck had grown so rapidly that Westmoreland
 County was formed from Northumberland. By
 1664, settlement upriver necessitated the forma-
 tion of the Potomac River county of Stafford.
 Merchants from London and Bristol supplied
 colonists living along the Potomac and Rap-
 pahannock rivers, purchasing tobacco on credit
 and delivering a variety of finished goods from
 English manufacturers (Horn 1988:75). Rapid
 settlement of the Northern Neck resulted in

 shortages of land within a few decades, and as
 servants fulfilled the terms of their indentures

 they were forced to look elsewhere for patent-
 able land (Sprinkle 1985:3992-3993).

 John Hallowes

 John Hallowes was born in December 1615

 and easily navigable waterways, combined with
 a landscape that had been partially cleared by
 Indian farmers, made the inlets and necks of the

 area desirable locations for 17th-century English
 settlement (Potter and Waselkov 1994; Klein and
 Sanford 2004:66-67).

 The third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644-1646)
 resulted in a 1646 treaty between the Virginia
 Colony and an alliance of Indian groups. The
 treaty specified that all land north of the York
 River, including the area along the southern
 shore of the Potomac, was to remain free of
 English settlement. Virginia's colonial govern-
 ment, however, did not strictly enforce the ban.
 Northumberland County, which encompassed

 in Lancashire, England, to Henry and Elizabeth
 Hallowes (Fishwick 1888:158; Buchanan and
 Heite 1971:38). He was baptized in the Roche-
 dale Parish Anglican church later that month. In
 March of 1634, at the age of 19, he travelled
 on the Ark , one of the first two ships sent to
 colonize Maryland. Upon his arrival in the
 fledgling colony, he was indentured to Thomas
 Cornwalyes, who had paid for his passage under
 the headright system (Stone 1987:17). Corn-
 walyes, destined to become one of the richest
 men in the colony prior to the 18th century,
 was a Roman Catholic and a commissioner of

 the Maryland Colony (Maloney 1996:45; Rior-
 dan 2004:24-26,29,195-196).

 With his indenture complete by 1639, John

 Hallowes married Restitute Tew on 2 June of

 that year in a ceremony performed by Thomas
 White, most likely a Protestant who served as
 a justice of the peace for St. Mary's County
 (Browne 1887:52). Hallowes subsequently
 acquired land at St. Michael's Hundred, work-
 ing as a mariner and carpenter throughout the
 1640s and transporting tobacco to Virginia as
 early as 1642 (Browne 1887:67,154,169). By
 1647, he had established a residence at a settle-
 ment known as Appamattucks, located along
 an approximately 10 mi. stretch of riverfront
 between Mattox Creek and Nomini Bay on the
 south bank of the Potomac River (Library of
 Virginia 1650-1652:49, 1653-1659:15; Browne
 1887:331). He still nurtured close ties to Mary-
 land, however, and continued to do business
 there for the remainder of his life.

 (Library of Virginia 1675-1689:220; Buchanan and
 Heite 1971:39). Although the period of tenancy
 is unclear, the property may have been leased
 as early as 1666, when the Andersons moved to
 Stafford. The land stayed in the Manley family
 until 1722, when Samuel Hallowes, John's distant

 cousin, sued for and won the property. He never
 came to Virginia and sold the land to Thomas
 Lee of Stratford Hall in 1733. The property then
 stayed in the Lee family until 1838 as part of
 the plantation at Stratford (Buchanan and Heite
 1971:39). It went through a series of subsequent
 owners before being acquired by the Stratford
 Harbour development in the 1960s.

 Archaeology at the Site

 Hallowes became a wealthy man by the stan-
 dards of the day, owning over 5,000 ac. of land
 and several servants. He served as a commis-

 sioner for Northumberland County from at least
 1650, when records for the county begin (Library
 of Virginia 1650-1652:49; Nugent 1934:207,252).
 Additionally, when Westmoreland County was
 created from Northumberland, he was appointed
 major in the militia and a justice for that county
 (Library of Virginia 1653-1659:36; Buchanan and
 Heite 1971:39). In 1655 Restitute Hallowes died,
 and John married Elizabeth Sturman (Nicklin
 1938:444). By 1657, the year of his death, Hal-
 lowes had been appointed sherriff of the county,
 a position generally reserved for members of the
 gentry (Library of Virginia 1653-1659:80; Can-
 et al. 1991:23).

 Hallowes's widow married David Anderson and

 probably lived on the Appamattucks property until
 1666, when Anderson moved to Stafford County
 (Nicklin 1938:440). The property then passed to
 Hallowes's daughter, Restitute, and her husband,
 John Whiston, who repatented the land in 1667,
 but probably did not live there. In 1674, Resti-
 tute, granddaughter of John Hallowes, and her
 husband, Matthew Steel, acquired the property.
 Court records confirm that the land was occupied
 by tenants during this period (Buchanan and Heite
 1971:39). Upon Steel's death in 1680, Restitute
 married John Manley, who, in 1681, obtained per-
 mission to evict the tenants from his wife's land

 Field notes from the 1968-1969 excavations

 lack the standardization and detail expected in
 modern recording systems. However, enough
 information was recorded in notes, maps, photo-
 graphs, and in the article published in Historical
 Archaeology to allow overall field methods to
 be understood (Buchanan and Heite 1971:40).
 Excavators gridded the site and used a system
 of lot numbers, grid numbers, and feature num-
 bers to record artifact- and feature-provenience
 information. Volunteers conducted surface collec-

 tions, with some collection areas tied to the site
 grid. They removed the plowzone at the site by
 shovel, although a photograph from the excavation
 period also shows a bulldozer in use. Only one
 artifact type with a terminus post quem postdating
 the 17th century (two ironstone fragments) was
 recovered from a total of 1,974 surface-collected

 artifacts and faunai remains. The tight clustering
 of artifact dates overall indicates a short period
 of occupation.

 There is no evidence that excavators screened

 plowzone or feature fill; however, the recovery of
 a few small artifacts from features indicates that

 these were probably excavated by trowel, resulting

 in greater recovery rates for these contexts. Indeed,
 more than two decades after the excavation at

 Hallowes, Edward Heite remained opposed to
 screening, arguing that the use of screens detracted
 from attention to stratigraphie provenience of
 the artifacts in situ, despite several studies that
 had demonstrated their importance to artifact
 recovery (Heite 1992:15-16). The nonstandard

 recovery methods that excavators used biased

 ible artifacts. These methods probably led to the
 underrepresentation of beads, straight pins, and
 small animal bones in the collection.

 used in the reanalysis included calculating an
 adjusted mean ceramic date for the site and for
 features, dating by terminus post quem , using a
 ceramic intersection (Figure 3), and calculating
 pipe-stem dates (Figure 4) (Tables 1 and 2).
 Historical research allowed for the creation of

 Artifacts: Interpreting Site Chronology

 Prior to the reanalysis, the fortification of the
 house at the Hallowes site was thought to date
 to the last quarter of the 17th century (Buchanan
 and Heite 1971:39; Neiman 1980a:74, 1993:265;
 Carson et al. 1981:191; Hodges 1993:205-206,
 2003:509). Subsequent refinements of chronolo-
 gies for artifact manufacture and use in the 1600s
 have resulted in a reassignment of site-occupation
 dates to approximately 30 years earlier.

 Common methods of dating for archaeological

 sites from the 17th and 18th centuries that were

 an hypothesized date range of occupation of
 1647-1681, bracketed on one end by John Hal-
 lowes's arrival in Virginia and on the other by
 a reference in the Westmoreland County records
 that describes the eviction of tenants from the

 land (Library of Virginia 1675-1689:220). The
 hypothesized date range yielded a mean occu-
 pation date of 1664 that is extremely close to
 the dates arrived at through the analysis of the
 archaeological assemblage.

 Artifact date ranges were adjusted by
 removing wares with extremely long periods
 of production - in this case tin-glazed

 unassociated with the occupation of the site.
 Morgan Jones-type ceramics were also excluded

 from the mean ceramic date since the precise
 date range for the ware is uncertain. A more
 detailed discussion of this type at Hallowes
 has been published separately (McMillan et al.
 [2014]). The beginning dates for all the early
 ceramic types were pushed forward to 1634,

 An exact chronology of individual feature con-
 struction, use, and abandonment is not possible
 due to some methodological issues relating to
 excavations, and to the problems of chronological
 resolution arising from the ubiquity of Morgan
 Jones-type coarse earthenwares. Nevertheless,
 three phases of development and alteration have
 been identified.

 since the European occupation of the Potomac
 Valley did not begin until the settlement of St.
 Mary's City in that year. In effect, the adjustment
 of these dates kept #the mean ceramic date
 from being pushed back in time artificially. In
 addition, while North Devon gravel-tempered
 coarse earthenware can date as early as 1650,
 for this study an introduction date of 1675 has
 been assigned in keeping with common use
 in the Chesapeake (Maryland Archaeological
 Conservation Lab 2012). Following these
 considerations, the adjusted mean ceramic date
 for the site as a whole is 1670, while the
 adjusted date for features is 1664. The latest-
 dating artifact that is contemporary with the site's
 occupation is a Priamus Williams marked pipe
 with a terminus post quem of 1677.

 The first phase of occupation incorporates the
 construction and early use of the dwelling, bas-
 tions, and Features 17 and 63 (Figure 5). The
 structure was a hall-and-parlor plan of earthfast
 construction with an off-center brick hearth. The

 Dwelling , Phase 1

 Several other artifact types and patterns from
 the site also lend support to an occupation date
 range that spans the third quarter of the 17th
 century. For example, 14% of the total tobacco-
 pipe assemblage is comprised of locally made
 pipes, mirroring patterns seen in sites dating from
 1660 to 1680 excavated by members of the Lost
 Towns Project in Maryland (Cox et al. 2005).
 Glass bottles on the site also point to a pre- 1680
 occupation, since three of the four glass ves-
 sels identified were case bottles, and the fourth
 vessel was a round bottle of the globe-and-shaft
 style dating to ca. 1640-1660 (Lanmon 2011:19-
 20,287-288). Finally, even the faunai remains
 point to a pre- 1660 date, since the proportions
 of beef, swine, and venison closely resemble the
 averages for sites dating between 1620 and 1660
 (Miller 1984; Bowen 1996). While these methods
 are not standard dating tools in the Chesapeake,
 they do provide important corroborating evidence
 for site dates that have been determined using
 more conventional methods and must be seen as

 more than just coincidence.

 Site Features and Chronology

 The 1960s excavations revealed the remains

 of a single post-in-ground dwelling with a brick
 chimney base and ditch-set bastions at opposite
 corners (a possible later addition), two ditch-set
 fence lines, a shallow basin-like feature (Feature
 63) within the southwest bastion, a large pit fea-
 ture (Feature 17) directly north of the dwelling,
 and other small features in the yard and within
 the building (Figure 2).

 house was oriented with its east facade facing
 Currioman Bay (Buchanan and Heite 1971:41).
 It measured approximately 50 ft. north-south by
 20 ft. east-west and was supported by a total of
 12 structural posts, 11 of which were exposed
 and excavated. The distances between post
 molds, starting from the northeast corner of the
 east wall, were 9.5, 10.5, 9.7, and 9.9 ft, while
 from the northwest corner along the west wall
 they measured 9.1, 10, 9.9, 9.7, and 10.4 ft. The
 spacing is consistent with construction methods
 used in 17th-century "Virginia houses," where
 studs, placed between posts set at 10 ft. intervals,
 served as points of attachment for 5 ft. lengths of
 clapboarding that formed the outer walls of the
 structure (Stone 1982:233).

 Judging from the orientation of the post
 holes - long axes parallel to the wall line - and
 the location of the post molds, the dwelling
 was raised using what is variously known as
 the tie-beam, reverse, or bent-assembly method
 (Carson, Barka et al. 1981:150; Moser et al.
 2003:200-201; Carson, Bowen et al. 2008:54-55).
 If one story in height, the dwelling contained
 1,000 ft.2 of interior space within the main block;
 if two storied, or, more likely, one story with a
 loft, the available space doubled to 2,000 ft.2.
 Summary data for post-hole and -mold features
 are presented in Table 3.

 A locally made belly bowl-style pipe bowl
 fragment with a rouletted rim was the single
 dateable historical artifact recovered from the fill

 of the structural post holes (Feature 51) (Table
 3). While this particular style of pipe cannot be
 dated with certainty, it is generally associated with

 contexts dating from the early to mid-17th century

 (Luckenbach and Sharpe 2007). One post hole
 contained three fragments of Prince George-type
 Indian pottery; the remainder did not contain
 any artifacts (Table 3).

 Indeed, the fact that the building stood for more
 than 30 years without repair to the structural
 posts speaks to his skill as a carpenter.

 Post molds contained numerous artifacts,
 including a fragment of North Devon gravel-
 tempered ceramic, suggesting that the destruc-
 tion of the house dated to the late 1670s or

 early 1680s (Noël Hume 1969:133; Maryland
 Archaeological Conservation Lab 2012) (Table
 3). The posts were not replaced during the life
 of the structure, supporting the argument that
 the site was occupied for a relatively short
 time. The average lifespan of a post-in-ground
 structure in the Chesapeake was about 20 years,
 although with the right materials and conditions
 some posts could last much longer without
 replacement (Carson, Barka et al. 1981:133).
 From his experience as a carpenter in Maryland,
 John Hallowes may well have been familiar
 with the durability of various species and would
 have selected the proper wood for a long-lasting
 house, probably red cedar or black locust.

 Located slightly off center of the interior of
 the structure were the remains of an H-shaped,
 partially robbed, brick chimney base (Buchanan
 and Heite 1971:41). Measuring approximately
 11 ft. north-south by 10.5 ft. east-west, the
 chimney divided the dwelling into a minimum
 of two rooms. The northern room, the chamber
 or parlor, measured roughly 20 x 20 ft. The
 southern room, the hall, may have measured
 roughly 30 x 20 ft. Irregular spacing between
 the last two post molds in the west wall line,
 however, indicates that this space was likely
 partitioned, with an unheated room measuring
 10.5-11 x 20 ft. along the south gable end, and
 the hall measuring 20 x 20 ft. In this scenario,
 the house follows a three-unit plan described
 by Neiman as typical of 17th-century English
 houses with a lobby entry (Neiman 1978:3107,
 1990:261-262, 1993:265-267).

 Feature 17

 Feature 17, a large square pit measuring
 approximately 13 ft. east-west by 9.5 ft. north-
 south, with a 2 ft. extension from the southeast

 quadrant, was located approximately 20 ft. north
 of the dwelling. Photographs indicate that the
 walls of the feature appear to have been rela-
 tively vertical, but its depth could not be deter-
 mined because there were no post-excavation
 images (Figure 6). It contained three layers and
 was cut by what the excavators described in the
 excavation notes as a "brick disturbance." The

 top layer contained dark fill, rich in artifacts and
 oyster shells. It sealed a layer defined by ash
 and oyster shell, which in turn sealed a layer
 characterized by significant amounts of mortar.
 Morgan Jones-type ceramics in the uppermost
 layer indicate a fill date of no earlier than the
 mid- 1660s. This date is supported by the pres-
 ence of a single fragment of Rhenish stoneware
 with manganese decoration, which post-dates
 1660 (Noël Hume 1969:281). The middle layer

 of fill contained the largest number of artifacts
 on the site, particularly faunai remains, and
 was assigned a terminus post quem of ca. 1640
 due to the presence of a Bookbinder-style pipe
 stem (Luckenbach and Kiser 2006:165). Finally,
 the deepest layer contained a single fragment
 of Martincamp-type earthenware, in production
 during the first half of the 17th century (Hurst
 et al. 1986; Straube 2001:55-58). The brick dis-
 turbance contained few artifacts, but a terminus
 post quern of ca. 1640 was assigned based upon
 the presence of a Bookbinder-style pipe stem
 (Luckenbach and Kiser 2006:165).

 The pit and the dwelling are not aligned. This
 fact, in combination with the early date of the
 artifacts from the deeper fill layers and the pres-
 ence of building materials in the fill, indicate
 that it was created and filled quite early in the
 site's history. Shortly after its abandonment, the
 pit became a location for the disposal of refuse
 from the Hallowes household. A later ditch-set

 fence, originating at the northwest corner of the
 dwelling, cut the northwest comer of the feature.

 This relationship indicates that the pit was filled
 while the house was still occupied. Buchanan
 and Heite (1971:41) interpreted the feature as
 a temporary pit house used while the dwelling
 was under construction, and the results of the

 were probably constructed right after the house
 was finished and removed about the time that

 Bastions

 Feature 63

 Attached to the southwest and northeast comers

 of the house were two large ditch-set bastions.
 The Hallowes site was among the first post-in-
 ground buildings and the first fortified house
 uncovered in the Chesapeake, and methods for
 identifying and excavating this type of structure
 were underdeveloped in the 1960s. Previously
 interpreted by Buchanan and Heite (1971:41)
 as wing additions or drains, the bastions have
 subsequently been recognized as components
 of a domestic fortification (Neiman 1980a:74,
 1993:265-266; Carson, Barka et al. 1981:191;
 Hodges 1993:205-208). Ditch fill and post molds
 were not separated during excavation, although
 the excavators did recognize post molds in some
 sections of these features, particularly the south-
 west bastion (Buchanan and Heite 1971:40).

 The southwest bastion measured approximately
 9 ft. north-south by 12 ft. east-west and enclosed
 105 ft.2 of space. It was designed to defend
 the structure's western facade and the southern

 Within the southwest bastion, the excavators
 discovered a shallow basin-like feature (Feature
 63) that they interpreted as a pit, privy, or but-
 tery (Buchanan and Heite 1971:41). It measured
 approximately 8 ft. east-west by 5 ft. north-
 south. The depth of the feature is unknown, but
 photographs suggest that it was relatively shallow
 compared to the bastion (Figure 8). The location
 of Feature 63, and the way that it respects the
 boundaries of the bastion ditch, suggests that it
 was created while the bastion was being used.
 It is possible that the feature was excavated and
 the fill was thrown against the sides of the bas-
 tion to create a firing step, which would have
 allowed defenders to shoot over the palisade
 from the interior (Noël Hume 1982:223-225;
 Miller 1986:54). This interpretation is supported
 by the presence of several divots within the
 feature cut that are recorded photographically,
 possibly suggesting shovel marks created during
 the initial excavation of the feature in the late

 1640s (Figure 9).

 gable end. The northeast bastion defended the
 eastern facade and the northern gable end. It
 measured approximately 13 ft. north-south by 20
 ft. east-west and enclosed 212 ft.2, or twice as
 much space as its counterpart to the south. The
 reason for the much larger size of this bastion
 is unknown, but it may be due to the dwelling's
 orientation. The larger bastion, facing the water,

 The feature contained two layers, each filled
 with domestic trash, including a large amount of
 faunai remains. Large numbers of fish remains
 in each layer, particularly sheepshead (Archosar-
 gus probatocephalus) and black drum (Pogo nias
 cromis ), indicate that the feature was filled in late
 spring, since those species spawn during May
 and June and would have been more accessible

 viewing the site from Currioman Bay and the
 Potomac River (Figure 7).

 No evidence exists to pinpoint a construction

 date for the bastions, but the fact that both
 features cut into structural post holes for the
 house indicates that they were put up after
 the building was completed. The fill from the
 bastions, which included Morgan Jones-type
 lead-glazed coarse earthenware, indicates that
 they were taken down as early as the mid- 1660s.
 Based upon the lack of North Devon gravel-
 tempered coarse earthenware in the fill, and the

 Archambault 2006). Following the same logic
 used to date the bastions and with the presence
 of Morgan Jones-type ceramics in both layers,
 the feature was filled no earlier than the 1660s,
 most likely after the bastions were removed.

 the main house (3 x 1.5 ft.) and, therefore, does
 not appear to be contemporaneous with them.
 However, the post mold is roughly the same
 size as the other structural posts, being about
 1 x 1 ft. The hole and mold were excavated

 construction, with an additional post or posts
 aligned to a structural timber from the east wall
 line falling just outside of the excavated area.

 While the evidence for such a construction is

 tenuous, an earthfast addition would explain the
 presence of the post hole and mold east of the
 southeast end of the dwelling, and would pro-
 duce a floor plan strikingly similar to the earli-
 est plan of the Clifts manor house and the ca.
 1670s manor house at Newman's Neck (Neiman
 1978, 1980a:39-47; Heath et al. 2009). If this
 room were added, its presence along the east
 facade of the house would have obscured lines

 of sight from the northeast bastion. Therefore,
 its construction likely postdated the destruction
 of the fortifications.

 Phase 3

 There are numerous other features on the

 Hallowes site, but most consist of small posts
 or amorphous yard features, the dates and func-
 tions of which are difficult, if not impossible,

 to determine. However, there appear to be at
 least four distinct ditch-set fences related to

 the house (Figure 10). The presence of these
 fences indicates a substantial rearrangement of
 the landscape that took place during the later
 occupation of the site.

 Ditch-set fences could be built in two ways.
 One method consisted of setting upright planks
 in an approximately 1 ft. deep ditch and pack-
 ing the soil around them to hold them in
 place, creating a barrier known as a slot fence
 (Samford and Moody 1989:14). Another method
 employed the use of woven wattle around
 upright poles set in a shallow ditch (Neiman
 1980b:25). Excavations of a number of 17th-
 century landscapes, including those at Brush-
 Everard, Rich Neck, Wolstenholme Towne,
 Nansemond Town, Hampton in the James River
 valley, and the Clifts in the Potomac Valley
 of Virginia, have uncovered fences of these
 types (Neiman 1980b:25; Samford and Moody
 1989:14; Muraca et al. 2003:26-28,71,90-91).
 Similar fences have been found at a range

 archaeological studies, the majority of work has
 focused on 17th-century Maryland and prehistoric
 or 18th-century Virginia, often treating the two
 localities as distinct from one another (Fausz
 1988; Carr et al. 1991; Potter 1993; Wells
 1994; Riordan 2004; Rice 2009; Walsh 2010).
 Archaeological and historical research focusing on
 Virginia's 17th-century Potomac shore has been
 conspicuously absent as compared to research in
 Maryland, with a few exceptions (Buchanan and
 Heite 1971; Neiman 1978, 1980a, 1980b; 1993;
 Coombs 2004; Heath et al. 2009; Rice 2009;
 Hatch et al. 2013).

 The reanalysis revealed that John Hallowes built
 the fortified house, and he and his family occupied
 the site for much of its history. A closer look at
 Hallowes's political alliances illuminates the strong
 connections that existed between people on both
 sides of the river in the 17th century. These con-
 nections, seen through the combination of archaeo-
 logical and historical data, reveal how intercolonial
 interaction affected settlement, politics, and trade
 in Virginia's Potomac Valley.

 John Hallowes's experiences in Maryland and
 his subsequent move to Virginia were shaped
 by political tensions between and within the two
 colonies and by ethnic tensions between colonizers
 and Indians. The first wave of settlers to Mary-
 land, of which he was a part, found themselves in
 contested territory. In 1632, King Charles I granted
 Cecil Calvert, Lord Baltimore, substantial lands
 in the northern reaches of Chesapeake Bay. To
 the south, powerful Virginians, who were ardent

 Protestants, petitioned the king to revoke this royal
 charter that took away land they considered to be
 part of their colony. The charter was upheld by
 the Lords Commissioners for Foreign Plantations,
 to whom the king had referred the challenge
 (Jonas 1966:242).

 Cecil Calvert thus became lord proprietor of
 Maryland. Tensions mounted between Calvert sup-
 porters and their southern neighbors over control
 of Kent Island, a fur-trading post in the Chesa-
 peake Bay, and armed conflict erupted in 1635
 (Jonas 1966; Menard 1981:129-133). In an early
 confrontation that helped spark the Chesapeake
 "fur wars," men aboard a sloop belonging to
 Virginian William Claiborne, who had previously
 laid claim to the island, fired upon two Maryland

 tion also indicates that they were later features at
 the site. One fence line extends from the southeast

 corner of the northeast bastion, suggesting that it
 incorporated a remnant of that bastion. Another
 fence cuts the western side of the southwest bas-

 tion, while a third runs northwest of the northeast

 bastion and would have blocked the line of sight

 from that vantage point had it been standing when

 the bastion was in use. The fourth fence runs per-
 pendicular to the east wall of the structure. This
 line would have significantly hindered the defen-
 sive capability of the fortifications, creating blind
 spots along the eastern portion of the structure if
 the two features were contemporary. Additionally,
 this fence must postdate the eastern addition, as
 the two elements could not have been in place at
 the same time.

 The division of the yard space through the use
 of fences at the site is reminiscent of the yards at
 Mattapany-Sewall and at the St. John's site in St.
 Mary's City, Maryland, during the ca. 1675-1690
 period (Keeler 1978:54-58,63-64,147; Chaney and
 King 1999). At St. John's, the residents delineated
 a large forecourt area with fences in front of the
 primary facade of the structure. Additionally, the
 backyard was divided into two areas by a fence
 that corresponded to the interior hall and parlor
 rooms, effectively creating two outdoor spaces
 that mirrored the interior of the dwelling (Keeler
 1978:54-58). These two areas served distinct func-
 tions at St. John's, indicating the increasing for-
 malization of space in the Chesapeake over time
 (Keeler 1978:72-74). The segmentation of the yard
 through the use of fences at the Hallowes site
 may indicate similar processes taking place during
 the 1670s, but with almost no excavation in the
 yard area this conclusion is only speculative.

 and Colonial Conflict

 ships, the St. Helen and the St. Margaret. John
 Hallowes was aboard the St. Margaret , defend-
 ing Calvert's claims to power (Browne 1887:22;
 Jonas 1966:242-244; Fausz 1988:71; McMillan
 and Hatch 2012). Whether he was a willing
 supporter or defended Calvert in the service of
 Cornwayles is less clear. In 1638, the Maryland
 Council gave Hallowes and Cuthbert Fenwick,
 who had also been transported into Maryland
 by Thomas Cornwayles and later served as his
 factor (Stone 1987:27), permission to arrest
 people trading with Indians without a license and
 to confiscate their goods and vessels. This act
 effectively made Hallowes and Fenwick privateers
 and put them on the front lines of opposition to
 Virginians' claims to trade in the area (Browne
 1885:83-84; Maloney 1996:56).

 Although he may have begun life in Maryland
 as a supporter of the lord proprietor, by the 1640s
 Hallowes was no longer allied with the proprietary
 cause. His former master, Thomas Cornwayles,
 had also become a vocal critic of Calvert (Malo-
 ney 1996:46). In 1644, Richard Ingle, a promi-
 nent trader, arrived in the Chesapeake, setting
 off a series of events that brought the rancorous
 politics and unrest of the English Civil War to
 the Potomac Valley (Riordan 2004:3-6). A strong
 Parliamentarian and Protestant (he named his
 ship The Reformation ), Ingle was accused of
 defaming the king by acting Maryland governor
 Giles Brent. Under orders from the Maryland
 Council, Thomas Cornwalyes apprehended Ingle.
 Cornwalyes eventually released him without
 the governor's consent because Ingle was never
 convicted of a crime. Brent accused Cornwalyes
 of being in league with Ingle and tried to arrest
 him. Both Ingle and Cornwalyes left Maryland
 together for England (Riordan 2004:139-149).
 Ingle returned to the Chesapeake again in 1644
 and recruited men from the Chicacoan settle-

 ment on the Virginian side of the Potomac River
 to capture Maryland in the name of Parliament
 (Riordan 2004:185-186). In February 1645, he
 lead an attack on St. Mary's, the colonial capital,
 captured Cornwalyes 's house, and used it as a
 base of operations until he moved the rebel force
 to Nathaniel Pope's house. Renamed "Mr. Pope's
 Fort," the house, which had formerly belonged
 to Cecil Calvert's brother Leonard, was fortified
 with a palisade (Riordan 2004:227-231). Ingle left
 about a month after the invasion, and the rebels
 commanded Maryland until December 1646, a

 Settlement

 period known as the "Plundering Time" (Menard
 1981:140, n. 54). The rebel forces were comprised

 primarily of Protestant settlers who lived on the

 manors controlled by the Catholic gentry of Mary-
 land (Riordan 2004:221-223).

 One of these rebels was John Hallowes. His

 opposition to Calvert and the Loyalists is con-
 firmed by the oath of fealty that he had to swear
 to Lord Baltimore in January 1647 (Browne
 1885:174), and by his service to Edward Hill,
 a Virginian illegally appointed as governor of
 Maryland during the rebellion (Riordan 2004:268).
 By September 1647, Hallowes had left Maryland
 for the Virginia settlement of Appamattucks. His
 reasons for leaving are ultimately unknown, but
 his disapproval of how the Maryland Colony was
 being governed by Lord Baltimore was likely
 an important factor. During the late 1640s, there
 was an influx of former Maryland rebels to the
 Appamattucks settlement, including Hallowes,
 Nathaniel Pope, and Walter Broadhurst (Library
 of Virginia 1650-1652:49,67,71-73, 1653-1659:36;
 Riordan 2004:221-223; McMillan and Hatch
 2012). These men all left Maryland at about the
 same time and for a similar reason. Indeed,
 they may have feared retribution for their role
 in the rebellion.

 The archaeological manifestations of conflict
 in the Potomac Valley can be viewed on both
 the broad scale of settlement patterning around
 the Hallowes site and the narrow scale of site

 architecture, particularly relating to the forti-
 fication of Hallowes's house. The settlement

 and community at Appamattucks illustrates the
 important role that the people and politics of
 Maryland had in Virginia, while the fortification
 of John Hallowes's house reveals how conflict

 in the Potomac Valley impacted individuals on
 a day-to-day level. Both examples illustrate why
 the river valley can be a more productive unit of
 analysis than other proposed units, which include
 the tobacco region, modern and past political
 boundaries, or the Chesapeake Bay, for interpret-
 ing archaeological assemblages (Walsh 1999; P.
 Morgan 2011).

 Settlement on the Northern Neck, particularly
 before the influx of transatlantic migrants in
 the 1660s, was often heavily tied to kinship
 and community networks that were established

 At least 8 of these 11 men are known to have

 people that they either already knew or with
 whom they shared strong ideological or economic
 connections (McMillan and Hatch 2012; Hatch
 2013). Indeed, this pattern of settlement appears
 common throughout the Chesapeake into the 18th
 century (Beeman 1984; Rutman and Rutman
 1984; Walsh 1988; Perry 1990; Carr et al. 1991;
 Ptacek 2013). An example of this process on
 the Northern Neck includes a concentration of

 Maryland emigrants, mostly from Kent Island,
 settling around Chicacoan prior to 1645, possibly
 in relation to Calvert taking control of the
 northern Chesapeake fur trade (McMillan and
 Hatch 2012). Additionally, Robert and Elizabeth
 Newman moved to the Chicacoan area from

 the Plundering Time (Browne 1885:174,182,228;
 Nicklin 1938). Forces loyal to Lord Baltimore
 recaptured Maryland in late 1646 and early 1647,
 spurring the former rebels to seek out new homes
 free from the influence of the Calverts. One man,

 Nathaniel Pope, made his intentions explicit by
 attempting to recruit people on Kent Island to
 move with him to Appamattucks until they were
 able to retake Maryland from Lord Baltimore

 Most important to this study, and discussed in
 detail below, is the community at Appamattucks
 established by former Maryland rebels in 1647.
 Clearly, these communities, or enclaves, were
 important in the early history of the Northern
 Neck and provide a great deal of insight into
 life in the area. For the purposes of this paper,
 however, we emphasize the broader context of

 Potomac's shores.

 of Baltimore. They chose not to move to Chi-
 cacoan, which had been settled downriver almost
 a decade earlier, but rather settled in an area of
 the Potomac Valley that had not yet been popu-
 lated by Europeans. This decision marked their
 intention to create a distinct community identity
 for themselves through geographical separation.

 Once settled in Virginia, these former Mary-

 landers continued to interact frequently, as evi-

 A detailed examination of land patents, Virginia

 county court records, and proprietary records from
 Maryland reveals that there were 11 landowners
 who moved from Maryland to Virginia with their
 families and servants between 1647 and 1648,
 in what appears to be an intentional migration
 stemming from the aftermath of Ingle's Rebellion
 (Figure 11) (Table 4). All but one of the patentees
 had obtained land patents by 1652, and all the
 patents indicate that they settled at Appamattucks
 (McMillan and Hatch 2012; Hatch et al. 2013).
 Nine of these households appear to have come
 from the two neighboring hundreds of St. Mary's
 or St. Michael's in Maryland, indicating that they
 had likely known and interacted with each other
 long before their relocation. Two of the patentees
 in this wave had resided on Kent Island. Perhaps

 County prior to 1652 were Appamattucks men, as
 were the majority of justices in the newly formed
 Westmoreland County after 1653 (Table 5).

 Not only did Ingle's Rebellion act as a catalyst

 for the mass migration of people in 1647, it also
 served to unite these migrants around anti-Calvert
 political views. Unlike the relative diversity
 that defined many other communities settled by
 unrelated transatlantic migrants, the community
 at Appamattucks was formed in the crucible of
 rebellion by people who shared common beliefs
 and already knew one another and the Potomac
 landscape. The direct participation of the majority
 of these settlers in the rebellion served to create

 distinct community bonds that were reflected for
 the next decade and beyond in the lists of com-
 missioners for Westmoreland County, which were
 dominated by former rebels (Table 5).

 Why Build a Fortified House?

 Fortification

 The archaeological remains of 17th-century
 fortifications in the Chesapeake region are well
 documented from the 1607 James Fort to the

 fortified compound at the Clifts, dating to 1675.
 The earliest fortifications, associated with settle-

 ments funded by the Virginia Company, enclosed

 domestic and commercial complexes that could
 include several buildings. The English drew on
 professional military designs developed in war-
 fare on the Continent and from the experiences
 of early Virginia Company leaders in Ireland,
 specifically with the use of bawn architecture
 (St. George 1990: 242-244; Hodges 1993, 2003;
 Kelso et al. 1999; Pecoraro 2010). Fortifications
 from the early period of settlement in Vir-
 ginia resulted first from fears of Indian attack,

 To date, Hallowes is the only known Chesapeake

 site with fortifications built into the house. Other

 especially in the wake of the 1622 and 1644
 Powhatan uprisings, and as precautions against
 attacks from foreign European powers, spe-
 cifically the Spanish (Deetz 1993; Hodges 1993,
 2003; Pecoraro 2010). All of the earliest fortified
 sites are located on the peninsula and southside
 of Virginia, for obvious reasons of settlement
 patterning, but no fortified houses post-dating
 the mid- 1640s have been found in those regions,
 perhaps due to increased English settlement.

 archaeologists working on these sites have opted

 bastions were of equal size, bastions of signifi-
 cantly different sizes characterize the remaining

 appropriate when the perceived threat was of an
 Indian attack.

 The larger bastion at Hallowes was also
 approximately two times larger than any other
 bastion associated with a domestic fortification

 in the Chesapeake, and the smaller bastion was
 comparable only to the largest bastions at other
 sites. While our sample for domestic fortifica-
 tions is admittedly small, it does encompass all
 the published sites with bastions in the region,
 making the comparison of the bastions at Hal-
 lowes to those of other sites strongly suggestive
 but not conclusive. Other than defense and visual

 display, little can be surmised concerning the use
 of the bastions at Hallowes. Due to excavation

 methods that sampled plowzone in an unsys-
 tematic way, the spatial analysis of artifacts is
 suspect at best. However, it is likely that these
 spaces may have been used for storage of goods
 or livestock under certain conditions. In general,
 they were probably spaces for the performance of
 daily household activities due to their large size
 and proximity to the house.

 Before exploring the link between Ingle's

 Rebellion and the architecture at the Hallowes

 site further, it is useful to consider local rela-
 tions with Indian groups in the area generally,
 and Hallowes's relations specifically, in order to
 assess the likelihood that the fortifications were

 built in response to the real or perceived threat
 of Indian attack.

 Hallowes and the Indian Trade

 By 1634, the colonization of Maryland made

 Anglo-Indian interaction in the Potomac Valley a
 factor in the day-to-day lives of both Indians and
 European colonists. During the 1630s, William
 Claiborne's Virginians at Kent Island fostered
 strong relationships with the Susquehannocks
 to the north based on the fur trade, while
 Calvert's Marylanders closely allied themselves
 with neighboring Indian groups, such as the
 Piscataways, in order to act as a buffer against
 attacks from northern tribes (Fausz 1988;
 Rice 2009:98-102). Calvert's alliance with
 the Piscataways, traditional enemies of the
 Susquehannocks, and his attempts to wrest the
 northern fur trade from William Claiborne led

 to significant conflict between Maryland and
 the Susquehannocks that lasted until the 1650s
 (Potter 1993:191-192; Rice 2009:102-105).

 During this period of conflict, particularly after
 1642, Susquehannock raiding parties traveled
 down the Potomac Valley and attacked Mary-
 landers and their Algonquian allies, resulting
 in the deaths of several colonists. Additionally,
 the Susquehannocks raided Algonquian groups
 on the Virginia shore during this same period,
 including the Patawomecks (Rice 2009:105).
 However, the majority of these raids tended to
 strike upriver of the major areas of settlement.
 In general, conflict on this scale between the
 Europeans settling along the Potomac River
 prior to the 1660s - such as the Chicacoans, for
 whom the English settlers named their settle-
 ment, and their Indian neighbors the Matchotics
 and Yaocomicos - was minimal to nonexistent.

 Instead, it appears that large-scale violence
 between colonists and neighboring Indian groups
 did not occur during the early settlement of the
 Potomac Valley as it had along the James River
 from 1609 to 1646.

 While fear of Indian attacks along the tidal

 Potomac was still a reality of life prior to
 the 1660s, it tended only to be referenced in
 the Maryland records (Rice 2009:103). This is
 not to suggest that the Virginians at either the
 Chicacoan or Appamattucks settlements were
 immune to Anglo-Indian conflict, but, rather, the
 unique circumstances of these early settlements
 may have provided a stronger sense of security
 as compared to that of the Maryland colonists
 across the river. Many of the Chicacoan set-
 tlers were involved in Claiborne's Kent Island

 venture in the 1630s, and, as a result, would
 likely have been on good terms with the
 Susquehannocks, unlike their Maryland counter-
 parts (McMillan and Hatch 2012). The Maryland
 rebels who settled at Appamattucks received aid
 from the Virginians at Chicacoan during Ingle's
 Rebellion and maintained strong ties with that
 settlement after they had fled Maryland in the
 late 1640s. These connections to Claiborne, in
 conjunction with strong alliances with local
 Algonquian tribes, likely made the threat of a
 disastrous Indian attack on the colonists seem

 more unlikely for these Virginians than it did
 for the Maryland colonists during the 1640s
 and 1650s. Eventually, Anglo-Indian conflict did
 reach Virginia's Potomac Valley, but only after
 the massive influx of transatlantic immigrants
 starting in the 1660s, leading up to Bacon's
 Rebellion in 1676 (Sprinkle 1985).

 D. B. HATCH, B. J. HEATH, L. K. MCMILLAN - Reassessing the Hallowes Site 67

 Hallowes 's relationship with Indians during

 the 1640s is complex. In 1642, his former
 master, Thomas Cornwalyes, and Giles Brent,
 military commander of Kent Island following
 Claiborne's expulsion, organized and led a
 raid against the Susquehannocks in retaliation
 for Indian raids on the Maryland colonists the
 previous year (Riordan 2004:113). Surviving
 records indicate that Hallowes 's boat was hired

 Martin's Hundred, which presumably had larger
 populations to man and defend the bastions, had
 smaller bastions, suggesting that the fortifica-
 tions at Hallowes were more about display than
 actual functionality. While Hallowes was quite
 wealthy, it is unlikely that he had a household
 larger than the population of Martin's Hundred
 in the early 1620s, which numbered around 40
 (Noël Hume 1982:260).

 for the expedition, and Hallowes accompanied
 the raiders (Browne 1885:119-120; Riordan
 2004:113). Closer to home, he engaged in
 unlicensed trade with members of local tribes,
 an action that resulted in a warning from the
 council (Browne 1887:186). Until 1646, Hal-
 lowes appeared numerous times in the Maryland
 records suing or being sued for payments of
 tobacco, beaver, and roanoke (a type of bead)
 (Browne 1887:164,175-176,192,206,220,282). He
 was also warned in 1643 and 1644 about giving
 guns to Indians, again indicating his close
 association with the Indian trade in the upper
 Chesapeake Bay (Browne 1887:259).

 Similar efforts at displaying power through

 the orientation of public buildings to waterways
 have been observed in other colonial contexts

 of political conflict or competition (Lenik 2010;
 Pyszka 2012). The size and prominence of the
 waterside bastion at Hallowes does not support
 the proposition that the house was fortified to
 protect against Indian attacks, since most Indian
 raids would have been overland. Additionally,
 Hallowes 's close relationship with local Indian
 groups, based upon historical and archaeological
 evidence of trade, would also seem to rule out

 that possibility. The important aspects of orienta-
 tion and scale, when coupled with the documen-
 tary evidence of John Hallowes's involvement in
 Ingle's Rebellion, helps to explain the presence
 of the fortifications at the site.

 Fortifications: A Masculine Response
 to Ingle's Rebellion

 Unlike other domestic fortifications in the

 Chesapeake, which are generally houses sur-
 rounded by palisade fences, the fortifications
 at Hallowes effectively turned the house itself
 into a fort. The most interesting aspect of the
 architecture is the discrepancy in size between
 the two bastions. The difference in size appears
 to have little to do with practicality of defense,
 but is likely best explained in terms of visual
 perspective. The orientation of the site is such
 that the northeast bastion faces both Currioman

 Bay, which would have been the primary means
 of access to the site by water, and the Potomac
 River, the primary route of travel up and down
 the Northern Neck during the mid- 17th century
 (Figure 7). When this fact is taken into account,
 along with the knowledge that the northeast
 bastion is twice as large as any associated with
 a domestic fortification in the region, it seems
 probable that John Hallowes purposefully con-
 structed the northern bastion at a larger scale in
 order to make his home seem more imposing
 from the water along which most English set-
 tlers would have traveled. Indeed, other bawn-
 type fortifications, such as Nansemond Fort or

 The interpretation of what this architecture

 meant to both John Hallowes and the people
 who saw it along the Potomac River, however,
 is less straightforward. Based upon a close
 reading of the events before and after Ingle's
 Rebellion and how Hallowes was impacted
 by these events, we offer an interpretation of
 this unique architecture couched in ideas of
 colonial masculinity. Our argument is highly
 contextual in its examination of the maintenance

 of a single aspect of John Hallowes's identity,
 namely gender. However, as other researchers
 have pointed out, gender is, by its very nature,
 intimately tied to other aspects of identity,
 including race and status, and its expression is
 closely linked to context (Conkey and Spector
 1984; Spector 1993; Brown 1996; Wilkie 2004,
 2010; Beaudry 2006; Voss 2008). The ways in
 which people choose to create and express this
 aspect of identity and what remains of it archae-
 ologically can be highly variable. Therefore, this
 is an interpretation of a single site, place, and
 time, and should not be viewed as a "gendered
 pattern" of fortification to be tested at other
 sites in the Chesapeake. Rather, it is an attempt
 to understand what this architecture might have

 meant to John Hallowes and his contemporaries
 in reference to only one aspect of his identity.

 Upon his reclamation of Maryland, Cecil

 Calvert and, later, Thomas Greene, passed sev-
 eral laws that suppressed the rights of former
 rebels. One of these acts forbade them from

 of weapons in the colonial Chesapeake and
 competing ideas about military authority reveals
 that it may have been meant as a way of insult-
 ing the men involved in the rebellion.

 By the mid- 17th century, gun ownership in
 the Chesapeake was almost universal among
 free men (Brown 1996:177). Guns were essen-
 tial to frontier life in order to defend life and

 leaving the colony without permission (Browne
 1885:193-194). This law was a clear attempt
 to prevent the rebels from conspiring with
 sympathizers in Virginia, particularly those at
 Chicacoan, who had aided in the overthrow
 of the lord proprietor. For men like Hallowes,
 however, who had made a significant portion
 of their living from trade with Indians and the
 colonists of Virginia, the law proved oppres-
 sive to commerce, and no doubt influenced his
 decision to leave the colony. Perhaps Hallowes
 thought that if Baltimore and his allies passed
 laws to restrict the freedom of former rebels, it
 was only a small step from seeking martial ret-
 ribution. His fears may have been magnified by
 the fact that Calvert used a group of hired mer-
 cenaries from southern Virginia to reclaim his
 colony and then gave them land to settle near
 present-day Annapolis (Krugler 2004:182-184;
 Riordan 2004:258-270).

 In this sense, the fortification of his house
 may have been a way for John Hallowes to
 allay his own fears of retribution from the Cal-
 vert faction in Maryland. Calvert never did seek
 military action against the former rebels, and the
 Virginia records show no evidence of any fear
 of an attack from Maryland by the Chicacoan
 settlers. With this being the case, perhaps the
 fortification at Hallowes was less of a defensive

 strategy and more of a challenge to the Balti-
 more faction's treatment of the former rebels.

 The orientation of the larger bastion toward the
 Potomac River created a more imposing facade
 for those approaching the site from the north,
 which, in addition to discouraging any form of
 attack, overtly signaled the militaristic nature of
 the settlement.

 In addition to imposing travel restrictions,
 Thomas Greene, who took over as governor of
 Maryland after Calvert's death in June of 1647,
 passed a law that required men involved in the
 rebellion to surrender their arms and ammunition

 while they were within the Maryland Colony
 (Browne 1885:193). While this law seems quite
 practical in preventing another uprising at first
 glance, a closer examination of the importance

 property, as well as to acquire food. The posses-
 sion of firearms by property-holding men came
 to symbolize colonial masculinity, so much
 so that guns were passed down from fathers
 to sons as a form of "patrilineal continuity"
 (Brown 1996:177). The ideas of masculinity
 and patriarchal authority associated with guns
 would have been all the more important in the
 Chesapeake during the mid- 17th century when
 mortality rates were high and demography was
 skewed such that traditional English family roles
 were difficult or impossible to duplicate. By
 stripping former rebels of their weapons while
 in Maryland, Greene was effectively stripping
 them of their manhood and reinforcing his own
 patriarchal authority.

 The same strategy was mirrored by Westmore-

 land County petitioners 30 years later following
 Bacon's Rebellion, when they suggested, unsuc-
 cessfully, that Baconians be denied the right to
 carry guns (Brown 1996:178). The following
 decade, the Maryland government tried a similar
 tactic in order to thwart an uprising. In 1689,
 the provincial council ordered that "[a]ll the
 publick Armes" be collected for repairs and sent
 to the sheriff at St. Mary's City or the magazine
 at Mattapany under the pretext of an impending
 attack by the Dutch (Browne 1890:56; Chaney
 and King 1999:72). However, rather than stem-
 ming from concern over foreign attack, their
 orders sought to remove firearms from the
 hands of the Protestant Associators who opposed
 the proprietary government. The council's plan
 failed, as few if any people surrendered their
 arms. The Protestant Associators successfully
 rebelled and took over the Maryland government
 in April of that year. In reviewing this tumul-
 tuous 40-year period in Chesapeake history, it
 is clear that access to firearms by the majority
 of men challenged the patriarchal authority of
 colonial leaders like the Calverts in Maryland
 and William Berkeley in Virginia. Yet limit-
 ing or forbidding the possession of firearms to
 men served to hinder the colonial venture. In

 their own forms of masculine authority through
 service as county commissioners, burgesses, and
 militia officers.

 If the fortifications at John Hallowes 's house

 The use of patriarchal authority to suppress

 rebellion is an indication that new ideas about

 masculinity and the military may have clashed
 with medieval forms of masculinity during and
 after the Plundering Time. While St. Mary's
 City was not created as a military settlement
 as Jamestown had been decades earlier, the
 conflicts surrounding Ingle's Rebellion were
 militaristic in character, including fortifications,
 plunder, and physical conflict. In the medieval
 view, military service was seen as a way for the
 lower classes to achieve a form of masculinity
 through mastery by way of plunder, conquest, or
 mutiny. Mutiny, which became a grave offense
 after the changes in military masculinity around
 the mid- 17th century, was seen as acceptable
 if soldiers were being mistreated (McCurdy
 2011:14-15). Starting in the late 16th century
 with the introduction of large numbers of small
 arms on the battlefield, new views of military
 order and masculinity were being formed that
 emphasized obedience, discipline, and defer-
 ence to commanders. However, this form of
 military masculinity coexisted with the medi-
 eval form into the mid- 17th century (McCurdy
 2011:21-22).

 Viewed through the lens of military mascu-
 linity, the actions by both the rebels and the
 leaders of Baltimore's proprietorship during and,
 specifically, immediately after Ingle's Rebel-
 lion can be seen as a conflict between these

 two schools of thought. The Baltimore fac-
 tion's demands for obedience from the former

 rebels, expressed through the passage of laws
 and the oath of fealty, were crucial to the spe-
 cific circumstances of the time and his need

 to keep control over his colony. More broadly,
 however, they were in keeping with the new
 ideas about masculinity and military authority
 that had started to solidify during this period,
 emphasizing obedience and punishing mutiny.
 However, many of the Maryland rebels appear
 to have subscribed to the medieval ideas of

 masculinity, evidenced by their participation in
 the Plundering Time. When Baltimore and his
 allies tried to force new gendered behaviors on
 the former rebels, many, like John Hallowes,
 fled to Virginia, where they could exercise

 are viewed in light of the suspension of gun
 ownership and conflicting concepts of military
 masculinity, then the bastions may be seen as
 a symbolic rejection of Lord Baltimore's patri-
 archal authority. The presence of fortifications
 at the site sent a general signal of power and,
 more specifically, indicated an armed, almost
 military, presence. The orientation of the larg-
 est bastion toward the water demonstrated

 Hallowes 's strength to passersby, especially
 Marylanders who had supported Baltimore and
 acted to dissuade them from antagonizing him.
 In the simplest terms, by fortifying his home
 John Hallowes was reclaiming his own mas-
 culinity and patriarchal authority that had been
 taken by Leonard Calvert, Thomas Greene, and
 Lord Baltimore.

 While fortifications in the Chesapeake have
 not been interpreted as explicit symbols of
 colonial masculinity, their relationship to gun
 ownership, military prowess, and competing
 forms of masculinity create important connec-
 tions among the concepts (Boulware 2011; Ditz
 2011:257-259; Lindman 2011; McCurdy 2011).
 The context of Hallowes's flight from Maryland
 after Ingle's Rebellion, coupled with Lord Bal-
 timore and his allies' passage of laws aimed at
 punishing the former rebels, provide important
 support to this interpretation. Whatever the
 exact meanings of the fortifications, it becomes
 clear that they were the direct consequence of
 Ingle's Rebellion, illustrating the extent to which
 conflict shaped the lives of the early settlers in
 Virginia's Potomac Valley.

 Conclusion

 Reanalysis of the Hallowes site has provided

 the opportunity to rediscover important aspects
 of the early history of Virginia's Potomac
 Valley that have been largely unexplored. It has
 revealed connections between Maryland and Vir-
 ginia that have generally not been examined by
 archaeologists and historians working mostly in
 the lower Tidewater region. These connections,
 long recognized by many Maryland research-
 ers, had an immeasurable impact on the early
 colonial history of the Northern Neck, and their

 remnants can still be seen today. The movement
 of people, ideas, and goods along the Potomac
 was integral to the societies that formed on both
 sides of the river in the mid- 17th century. The
 effect of colonial conflict on settlement patterns
 and architecture at the Hallowes site is a prime
 example.

 colonial Chesapeake (Rice 2009; P. Morgan
 2011). While it remains vitally important to
 understand community connections in this
 context, it was the river that helped to connect
 the members of the community and allowed
 them to move and coalesce into a unique
 entity. Early English settlers saw the river as a
 permeable boundary and a conduit for exchange.
 Understanding the Potomac Valley from their
 perspective deepens our understanding of the
 history and culture of its people.

 John Hallowes came to Maryland as a servant
 in 1634. By 1639 he was a free tobacco planter,
 mariner, and carpenter, and continued to live
 there with his family until 1647. He partici-
 pated in Ingle's Rebellion from 1645 to 1646,
 attempting to free the colony from Lord Balti-
 more's control. However, upon the failure of the
 rebellion, Hallowes and several other rebels fled
 across the Potomac to the less-regulated shores
 of Virginia, where they created a community at
 Appamattucks. Fearing retribution from Calvert's
 forces, or reclaiming the power and masculin-
 ity that he felt Calvert had taken from him,
 John Hallowes fortified his house so that all

 Acknowledgments

 The authors would like to thank William

 Buchanan and Edward Heite for leading the
 archaeological work at the Hallowes site in
 advance of its development in the late 1960s.
 Their efforts laid the groundwork for this analy-
 sis and served to bring to light an important
 piece of history that might otherwise have been
 lost. Virginia Sherman also deserves special
 credit for first bringing this site to the atten-
 tion of Buchanan and Heite and for conducting
 historical research on the site's inhabitants that

 travelers along the Potomac could see it. His
 relationship with the local Matchotic Indians and
 connections to Chicacoan settlers allied with the

 Susquehannock Indians served to allay his fears
 of large-scale Anglo-Indian conflict. Therefore,
 the construction of fortifications at the site was

 almost certainly related to his participation in
 Ingle's Rebellion, rather than a fear of Indian
 attack, as was the case for many other fortified
 sites in the Chesapeake (Neiman 1980a, 1980b
 Noël Hume 1982; Mouer et al. 1992; Kelso et
 al. 1999; Pecoraro 2010:62,88).

 Prior to this reanalysis, the site was interpreted
 as dating to after 1675, which had a significant
 impact on how it was viewed by historical
 archaeologists and historians, particularly in
 reference to the fortification and its purpose
 (Buchanan and Heite 1971; Neiman 1980a,
 1980b; Carson et al. 1981; Hodges 1993). This
 reanalysis, which has revised the occupation date
 of the site to 1647-1681, has benefitted from
 more than 50 years of research in Chesapeake
 history and historical archaeology, allowing
 for the refinement of dating and subsequent
 interpretations. This work has also benefitted
 from a nuanced understanding of early colonial
 history in the Potomac Valley, demonstrating
 how local events can have large impacts on
 the archaeological record. Finally, this research
 argues, indirectly, for the river valley as an
 important unit of analysis, particularly in the

 served as a starting point in this reanalysis.
 Without the dedication of these three people
 and the volunteers who aided them more than

 40 years ago, this reanalysis would not have
 been possible.

 Dee DeRoche, Virginia Department of Historic

 Resources, deserves special thanks for allow-
 ing us to bring this collection to Knoxville
 and hold it until our analysis was complete.
 Charles Hodges and Bly Straube prepared the
 original artifact inventory in the 1980s, and
 we are grateful for its accuracy and complete-
 ness. At the University of Tennessee, Crystal
 Ptacek produced the maps used here. Eleanor
 Breen helped to navigate the somewhat confus-
 ing original recording system, so necessary to
 assess contexts accurately. Lisa Phelan assisted
 in the measurement of some of the imported
 pipe-stem bore diameters, and Yolonda Moore
 spent hours combing the Archives of Maryland
 for references to John Hallowes.

 Bly Straube and Merry Outlaw, Preservation
 Virginia, and Julie King, St. Mary's College of
 Maryland, have recently provided insight into
 some of the ambiguous coarse earthenwares in
 the collection, including Morgan Jones type.
 Julie generously shared her historical research

 on Jones's potting career. Additionally, numerous
 conversations with Julie concerning her research
 on the Potomac River valley during the early
 colonial period have been of significant benefit
 to shaping the ideas presented here. Taft Kiser,
 Cultural Resources, Inc., provided information
 and help with identifying some of the locally
 made pipes. AI Luckenbach and Jane Cox, Lost
 Towns, also provided information about locally
 made pipes. Silas Hurry and Henry Miller, His-
 toric St. Mary's City, shared information about
 artifacts and faunai remains, and provided valu-
 able insights into the early history of Maryland.
 Luke Pecoraro provided detailed measurements
 of the bastions at Nansemond Fort, and Andy
