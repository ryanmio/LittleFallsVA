Re-creating Mount Vernon
The Virginia Building at the 1893 Chicago World’s
Columbian Exposition

Lydia Mattice Brandt

The Virginia Building at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, was understood as a complete
replica of George Washington’s Mount Vernon. The replica’s elite, white creators simultaneously posited Mount Vernon as
a paragon of the Southern plantation system defended by the Confederacy and as a symbol of a shared, national history that
indicated the South’s willingness to reconcile with the Union. Through the similarly conservative and retrospective strategies
of the Lost Cause and the colonial revival, the Virginia Building simulated an ideal world that reﬂected the attitudes of its
proponents on race, gender, and the state’s national role.

O N A WARM AUGUST DAY in 1893, hun-

dreds gathered on the grounds of Chi-
cago’s World’s Columbian Exposition to
celebrate the fair’s Virginia Day. A band played
‘‘Dixie,’’ the crowd’s rebel yell indicated that ‘‘a
large proportion of the audience was Southern,’’
and a series of Virginia’s political personalities re-
told the history of the state from Jamestown to the
present day, with an emphasis on ‘‘Liberty, Peace,
Fraternity and Union.’’1 After the public ceremo-
nies concluded, the group that had planned and
ﬁnanced the state’s exhibits in Chicago retired to a
private dinner held in the Virginia Building, a full-
scale replica of George Washington’s Mount Vernon

(ﬁgs. 1–2).2 This assembly represented the full
range of white, elite Virginians who had supported
the state’s participation in the fair: distinguished
former Confederate military personalities, mem-
bers of the defunct planter class, and supporters of
a ‘‘New South.’’ Surrounded by objects evoking ﬁg-
ures signiﬁcant to Virginia history from Washington
and Thomas Jefferson to Confederate President
Jefferson Davis and General Robert E. Lee, the
Mount Vernon replica created for the visitor an
impression of the uninterrupted evolution of the
state’s grace from the colonial plantation on the
Potomac, through the Confederacy’s heroism in
the Civil War, and into the prosperous future, where
Virginia would surely ‘‘come into port at last!’’3

Regional and national histories were insepa-
rable in the Virginia Building. The ﬁdelity of its
replication of Mount Vernon was meant to both
absolve its supporters of their participation in the
Confederacy and position them as productive, pro-
gressive members of a national culture and economy.
This dual narrative was consciously constructed in

included on the 1893 Virginia Building as documented in photo-
graphs, although it does appear in some prints and line drawings of
the building. This decorative feature disappeared and reappeared
on the original Mount Vernon throughout the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries and on replicas from 1893 until the 1930s.

order to fuel New South progressivism and national
reconciliation while allowing for the defeated ex-
Confederates to retain pride for their lost social
preeminence through the cultural movement dubbed
the Lost Cause. The New South Creed was the strat-
egy white Southerners embraced by the 1880s to
rebuild the region’s economy and participate in
national success (especially in terms of industrial
development) without letting go of the social, ra-
cial, and political ideals that had deﬁned them as
an antebellum and Confederate coalition.4 Many
simultaneously supported the Lost Cause, a fab-
ricated vision of the prewar South, in order both to
codify Southern pride in the culture defended by
the Confederacy and to prepare a palatable national
memory of the Old South ﬁt for reconciliation with

the North.5 The Virginians promoting both the
state’s economic potential and its cultural impor-
tance at the massive and international World’s
Columbian Exposition chose the man who was at
once the nation’s most universally revered icon
and the South’s most famous plantation master—
George Washington—to embody these dual concepts.
The image of the ﬁrst president’s house at the
World’s Columbian Exposition, therefore, repre-
sented two seemingly distinct memories: Mount
Vernon was at once a paragon of the Southern
plantation system so vigorously defended by the
Confederacy and a symbol of a shared national
colonial history. The crafted memory presented

in the Virginia Building established Washington
and Mount Vernon as steadfast symbols in an unin-
terrupted progression that began with union making,
led to inevitable union breaking, and ended with
a union reconciling. This version of reconciliation,
however, attempted to maintain the state’s South-
ern distinctiveness while insisting that Virginia—
and the South—had always been and would always
be an integral part of the Union. The once-defeated
South was going forward into the future, but only
through the valley of the past.

The Virginia Building straddled these seem-
ingly contradictory (but never mutually exclusive)
visions of Mount Vernon by utilizing the approaches
of the national colonial revival and the regional
Lost Cause movements to facilitate the presenta-
tion of a highly crafted memory.6 The promoters

6 The methodology for my interpretation of the ways in which
the Virginia Building exhibited an invented memory of the past
is dependent upon the following sources: John Bodnar, Remaking

of the Virginia Building longed for how they im-
agined that life in the Old South had been and
wished to proclaim the heroism of the Confederacy,
yet the Lost Cause was still forming in the early
1890s; the nascent movement lacked an appropri-
ate model for how the Virginia Building should
exhibit its ideology. The colonial revival, however,
could show the way. A similarly conservative atti-
tude toward the American past, it had been solid-
iﬁed in American popular culture and historic
preservation by 1893.7 It not only offered a national

narrative for the Virginia Building’s memory of
Washington and his home but also presented a
series of strategies for fundraising, presentation,
and organization that had already proven success-
ful in such projects as the preservation of Mount
Vernon by the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association
of the Union (MVLA). In this way, the colonial
revival helped the Virginia Building give shape to
the burgeoning Lost Cause ideology: to embody
both post-Confederate pride and an agreeable vi-
sion of a new South for a national audience.

A ‘‘State Building That Should Accurately
Represent Mount Vernon’’

In every visible way, the Virginia Building at the
1893 World’s Columbian Exposition seemed an ac-
curate replica of George Washington’s Mount Vernon
as it stood in Virginia. In his published account of
the World’s Columbian Exposition, Virginian R.
Beverly Eggleston exclaimed: ‘‘How delighted was
a Virginian to have his eye fall upon Mount Vernon
exactly reproduced.’’8 Eggleston’s pleasure in see-
ing a perfect reproduction of the symbol of ‘‘old
Virginny’’ was repeated time and time again by re-
porters, visitors, and especially Virginian guests.
Mount Vernon’s portico with its eight square col-
umns and its banquet hall with neoclassical mold-
ings and Palladian window, cupola, various dormers,
faux-stone ﬁnish, and distinctive asymmetrical fen-
estration pattern were, in fact, all reproduced to
scale. In addition, the two service ﬂankers (a kitchen
and guests’ quarters during the president’s lifetime)
were also reproduced, complete with the connect-
ing arcaded walkways (ﬁg. 3). The replica imitated
the ﬂoor plan of the original as well as the interior
elevations, reproducing such spaces as the entrance
hall, the banquet hall (used as the reception room),
the library, the bedroom in which Washington died,
and the attic chamber to which Martha Washington
retired after her husband’s passing.9

The Board of World’s Fair Managers of Virginia
strived to ensure that the Virginia Building would
look just as Mount Vernon did in the year 1893.
They had begun discussing the possibility of pro-
curing a model of Mount Vernon and borrowing
Washington-related objects for the Virginia Build-
ing from the MVLA in early 1892, even before the
Board of World’s Fair Managers of Virginia had
chosen an architect.10 By June of the same year, the
MVLA had agreed to provide a model so that the
Virginia Building could be faithfully copied.11
The Virginia Building’s Richmond-based architect,
Edgerton Stewart Rogers (1860–1901), presumably
made measured drawings of the building during
multiple trips to inspect Mount Vernon’s architec-
ture.12 Rogers published two of the replica’s inte-
rior elevations in the Inland Architect and News Record
shortly before the exposition opened, using the
titles of ‘‘Mount Vernon’’ and ‘‘Virginia Building’’
interchangeably (ﬁg. 4).13 The drawings conﬂated
Mount Vernon with its replica in Chicago, encour-
aging the idea that differences between the two
were indistinguishable down to the last detail. A
historian of the fair described the extent of the
ﬁdelity to the original in the Virginia Building’s
interiors: ‘‘The carved mantels and wood trimmings
were exact facsimiles, as well as the windows, with
small panes and sashes fastened with wooden
buttons.’’14

The Virginia Building’s hostess, Lucy Preston
Beale (1848–1928), also made multiple visits to
Mount Vernon in the early 1890s to ensure that the
interiors of the replica would imitate the MVLA’s
contemporary interpretations of the various do-
mestic spaces as closely as possible (ﬁg. 5). Beale
examined ‘‘details of the Mansion and the arrange-
ment of its furniture’’ to ensure that a visitor to
Mount Vernon in 1893 could walk into her ver-
sion of Washington’s home in Chicago and ﬁnd
little to no discernible difference between the two

buildings.15 According to a list published after the
fair, the furniture and other objects arranged in
the Virginia Building to reﬂect Beale’s observations
of Mount Vernon were not always from the colonial
period; some simply looked old. Many objects had
belonged to the Virginia-born founding fathers or
Washington himself, further connecting the exhibit
in Chicago with the real thing in Virginia. Objects
linked directly to Washington included a cloak pre-
sented to him by a European head of state, Martha
Washington’s tea caddy, a ‘‘specimen’’ of his hand-
writing, a handbell from Mount Vernon, and mul-
tiple chairs that he had once owned (and in which

he had presumably sat).16 A reproduction of the bed
and bedclothes in which Washington died com-
pleted the simulation of his bedroom; the real set
remained back in Virginia, as the MVLA deemed it
and other objects too precious to loan.17

Beale and the others who planned the Virginia
Building wanted to ensure that visitors also acknowl-
edged Virginia’s history beyond Washington. They
included, therefore, objects relating to other founding

Maury, also by Valentine; photographs of Confed-
erate money; and a photograph of Confederate
General Stonewall Jackson.20 The display of objects
pertaining to the Confederate States of America
alongside those of the colonial period conﬁrmed
the seamless historical narrative that many white
Virginians carried into the twentieth century. The
very presence of the Confederate heroes’ objects
inside a version of Washington’s sacred shrine
and their proximity to his artifacts afﬁrmed the
defeated soldiers’ honor.

The Virginia Building’s ﬁdelity to its histori-
cal model in scale, architecture, and interiors was
unique among the other state buildings at the
World’s Columbian Exposition, although multiple
state buildings at the fair were based on colonial
precedents. In fact, World’s Columbian Exposition
master architect Daniel Burnham had advised states
to build colonial revival structures and suggested
that they replicate a signiﬁcant historic building
whenever possible.21 Massachusetts followed suit,
basing its building loosely on the Hancock House
in Boston, demolished in 1863 (ﬁgs. 6–7). Unlike
the Virginia Building’s close relationship with its
model, however, the Hancock House was adapted
freely in order for the Massachusetts Building to
appear more ‘‘civic’’ and substantial so as to better
adapt to the prevailing architectural styles and scale
of the fair.22 The interiors of the other state build-
ings were also contrary to the Mount Vernon replica.
The Pennsylvania Building, for example, offered
both museumlike exhibits housed in cases, and
spaces dedicated to the relaxation or convenience
of fair visitors, such as a smoking room, ladies’ par-
lor, post ofﬁce and information room, and private
bedchambers where the governor and state commis-
sioners stayed during their visits to the fair (ﬁg. 8).23
According to all reports, the only concessions that
the Virginia Building made to the practical needs
of its guests were a reading room in which visitors
could peruse books by both contemporary and his-
toric Virginia authors and what was most likely a
counter for sending postcards and telegrams. Fol-
lowing the ﬁdelity of the architecture, the list of the

state’s contributions to the nation. They displayed
articles related to Thomas Jefferson, including a
prayer book, watch, pair of buckles, and a pair of
‘‘silver spectacles.’’ The third president’s own plan-
tation house, Monticello, was represented via a
series of photographs.18 The Virginia Building
also featured a piano that once belonged to Dollie
Madison.19

Although the promoters of the Virginia Build-
ing were primarily concerned with the state’s colo-
nial history in the selection of objects for exhibition,
they also celebrated their more recent, Confederate
past. In the same rooms where objects related to
Washington and Jefferson held court were exhib-
ited a miscellany of artifacts related to the heroes of
the Confederacy: whiskey ﬂasks and a mahogany
table owned by the president of the Confederacy,

furniture in the building suggests that even these
areas of the Virginia Building were outﬁtted not
with modern furniture but rather antiques or ‘‘old’’
articles.

Creating a complete facsimile of Mount Vernon
was clearly a conscious choice for the state’s or-
ganizers; the building was meant to be an exhibit in
itself. Rather than adjust Mount Vernon to serve a
public function, the Virginia Building’s organizers
maintained its arrangement and identity as a pri-
vate residence. By ensuring that the Virginia Build-
ing was understood as a home rather than a mere
way station or exhibit hall, the palpable connection
to the original was only further reinforced. The or-
ganizers had ample time to consider strategies other
than exact replication for their building; because
the Virginia General Assembly did not grant fund-
ing for the building until March of 1892, the con-
struction of the Mount Vernon replica was delayed

until long after Pennsylvania and Massachusetts
had already begun their own state buildings.24 The
objective of the state’s Board of World’s Fair Man-
agers that Virginia be represented by a ‘‘state build-
ing which should accurately represent Mount Vernon’’
was achieved; George Washington’s home in Vir-
ginia was seemingly indistinguishable from the copy
in Chicago.25

and early nineteenth centuries, yet Americans of
the era also sought a national canon of symbols.
Hence, Washington became both an emblem of un-
touchable greatness and an example for the com-
mon man. This multivalence explains the concurrent
and contradictory Federal and Confederate adop-
tion of his image during the Civil War.27 The
Virginia Building’s narrative took advantage of this
legacy of ambiguity by simultaneously harking back
to the Confederacy’s interpretation of the ﬁrst pres-
ident as a ‘‘proto-Confederate’’ and the North’s rhet-
oric of Washington and Mount Vernon as symbols
of union.

The Mount Vernon of 1893—and the Lost

Washington established by the Confederate and
proslavery movements in the years preceding the
Civil War. White, proslavery Southerners had re-

gesting that he would have sided with the Southern
states had he still been alive. The Confederacy went
so far as to claim to be the second coming of the
American Revolution; it argued that Confederates
were fully realizing the founding fathers’ vision af-
ter the government had gone astray by denying
states’ rights.28

The adherence to Washington as a symbol of
a sectionalist political ideology was memorialized
in the public sphere. In 1849, a competition for
the ﬁrst equestrian statue of Washington was an-
nounced, and the work was erected in what would
become the capital of the Confederacy: Richmond,
Virginia (ﬁg. 9). While other cities had already cre-
ated monuments to George Washington, it was par-
ticularly important for Virginia and the South to

claim the image of the ﬁrst commander in chief in
the years preceding the Civil War.29 By harnessing
Washington as a martial symbol during an era of
heightened sectional conﬂict, proto-Confederates
boasted their own potential for military might. As
historian Richard Bonner has observed, the mon-
ument ‘‘presented latent challenges to the image
of Washington the conservative savior of national
Union.’’30 Accordingly, the unﬁnished monument
served as the site of Jefferson Davis’s swearing in as
president of the Confederacy, and its depiction was
placed at the center of the seal of the newly seceded
nation (ﬁg. 10). The connection between the Con-
federacy and Washington was reinforced by the
choice of February 22, Washington’s birthday, as
the day of both the laying of the statue’s corner-
stone in 1850 and Jefferson Davis’s 1862 inaugura-
tion at its base.

As Washington had clearly been a symbol of
Confederate ideology, so had his home been used
by advocates of the proslavery movement in the
antebellum period.31 Mount Vernon was the ulti-
mate plantation house, complete with a master that
nearly all Americans agreed had been an honest
and admirable man. Junius Brutus Sterns’s highly
politicized 1851 painting of Washington in the ﬁelds
with African American slaves and Mount Vernon in
the background emphasized the ﬁrst president and
his house’s connection to the institution of slavery
within a year of the controversial passage of the
Fugitive Slave Law (ﬁg. 11).32 This painting not
only depicted Washington’s relationship to the insti-
tution of slavery as benign, but it reminded contem-
porary observers that Washington was a Southern
slaveholder and Mount Vernon a Southern plan-
tation.33 Painted in order to speak to the highly
charged debate over slavery in the early 1850s, im-
ages such as Stearns’s posited Mount Vernon and
Washington as distinctively Southern.

The persistence of George Washington and his
home as sources of pride in plantation culture
continued after the Civil War. The construction of
Richmond’s Monument Avenue, the premier state-
ment of the Lost Cause of the late nineteenth cen-

alism and its rhetorical connection to Washington
(ﬁg. 12).34 A wide boulevard now bordered by
imposing colonial revival mansions, Monument
Avenue’s main attraction is the tree-lined median
that features commanding monuments to Confed-
erate heroes that began with the unveiling of the
equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee and his trusty
steed, Traveller, in 1890 and continued through 1929
with the erection of four more sculptures (ﬁg. 13).35
This series of memorials is rooted in the two statues
of George Washington located in Richmond’s Cap-

dinated by Thomas Jefferson for the Virginia State

House in 1788.36 Not only did these two iconic
images of Washington provide stylistic precedents
for the statues built on Monument Avenue, but
they also offered an ideological link between the
memories of Washington and the Confederacy as
they were shaped by the Lost Cause, an association
facilitated by Monument Avenue’s proximity and
sight line to the two statues in Capitol Square
(ﬁg. 14).37 The correlation between a nationally
revered icon and a series of Confederate heroes
legitimized the Lost Cause project on Monument
Avenue, suggesting that just as Washington was
great, so too were these sons of the Confederacy.
The connection also resurrected the idea that the
Confederacy’s mission had been squarely in line
with the ideals of the founding fathers and recalled
the appropriation of the Washington equestrian

statue for the seal of the Confederacy. Monument
Avenue connected the ﬁrst president with the mis-
sion of the Lost Cause.

The relationship between Washington and
Robert E. Lee was especially strong in the Lost
Cause rhetoric, and this too was reﬂected on Mon-
ument Avenue’s streetscape. The two generals were
not only related by marriage but also often revered
for similar contributions to the nation: Washington
had fought for union in the Revolutionary War,
while Lee had peacefully advocated for reconci-
liation after the Civil War. In fact, Lee’s image was
depoliticized in the Lost Cause project with the
intent of feeding the memory of the Old South to
an audience beyond the former Confederacy. He
was refashioned as a national hero around which
all Americans could gather—much like George
Washington.38 The material rhetoric of Monument

Avenue reﬂects this transformation. The statue of
Lee on Monument Avenue is equestrian and on a
high base—similar to that of Washington in nearby
Capitol Square. Whereas Washington’s horse is
rearing in preparation for battle, however, Lee’s
Traveller has all four feet ﬁrmly on the ground: the
battle is over, the cause is lost, but the pride in the
plantation South and its ideals remains.

The developing correspondence between George
Washington and Confederate heroes continued in
Richmond for the rest of the century in other cul-
tural forms as well. Just six years after Monument

with Capitol Square, the South’s ﬁrst museum of

22, 1896, was another instance in a long line of
Confederate-related inaugurations held on George
Washington’s birthday. Before, during, and after
the Civil War, Confederate nationalists and sym-
pathizers publicly identiﬁed with Washington as an
attempt to connect their political and social agen-
das with a revered American symbol. By choosing
a Mount Vernon replica to represent the state in
1893, the Virginia Building’s organizers participated
in both the Confederate and Lost Cause traditions
of positing George Washington as a regional—and
therefore sectionalist—ﬁgure.

In the same years that Confederates had been
adopting Washington’s image and insisting that
they were the true successors of the founding fa-
thers, the MVLA was establishing Mount Vernon—
and consequently Washington—as a neutral sym-
bol of union. This long-standing meaning provided
a precedent for the relationship that Virginia tried
to reestablish in their reconciliation with the North
through the 1893 replica. First begun among South-
ern women, the 1850s movement to save Mount
Vernon demonstrated the multivalent meanings
of Washington and his home; the various inter-
pretations were never mutually exclusive. A South

ﬁed herself as ‘‘A Southern Matron’’ and deﬁned
the defense of Mount Vernon as both a Southern
and a national cause: ‘‘A descendent of Virginia,
and now a daughter of Carolina, moved by feelings
of reverence for departed greatness and goodness,—
by patriotism and a sense of national and, above all,
of Southern honour,—ventures to appeal to you in

preservation of Mount Vernon, and Cunningham
expanded her appeal to include Northern women.44
She argued in an 1858 petition: ‘‘Washington be-
longed not alone to the South! . . . Washington belonged
not to one State alone! Devoted woman would be
neither bafﬂed nor conquered; but she alone triumphs
when the common homestead can be procured as
a common heritage, for the estranged children of
a common father, the spell of whose memory will
yet have the power to reunite them around his
hallowed sepulchre.’’45 By appealing to American
women, rather than just Southerners, Cunningham
established a metaphor in which Mount Vernon
and Washington were symbols of a shared American
legacy, and the preservation of the house stood for
the perpetuation of the Union. She later applied
this concept directly in her calls for action from
American women: ‘‘When the Ship of State, with
no master hand at the helm, rocked to and fro
on the angry waves of sectional strife and bitterness
which threatened to engulf it; has stirred the heart
of woman to revive, through the rescue of sacred
ashes of the Father of his Country, that love for his
memory . . . which could be made all-powerful in re-
generating and healing inﬂuences!’’46 Cunningham’s
highly publicized pleas argued for Mount Vernon
as a symbol of union at the same time that the Con-
federates were using Washington’s image for the
very opposite purpose.47 She even convinced the
nationally renowned orator and New England na-
tive Edward Everett to join the Mount Vernon pre-
servation campaign in order to raise the proﬁle of
the project and convey its importance to Americans
both above and below the Mason-Dixon line.48

Mount Vernon’s perceived political neutrality
persisted through the Civil War, when the planta-
tion was ‘‘the only spot in all our now United States
where soldiers of both armies could meet on neu-
tral ground.’’49 Both a Northerner, Sarah C. Tracy,
and a Southerner, Upton Herbert, guarded Mount
Vernon throughout the war.50 In a response to an

moved from his Mount Vernon tomb and stolen

away to the mountains of Virginia by Confederates,
Tracy insisted that Washington forever remained
at his neutral shrine: ‘‘The public, the owners of
this sole possession, need fear no molestation of
this one national spot belonging alike to North and
South. Over it there can be no dispute!’’51 Thus,
Washington’s homestead was also a symbol of na-
tional unity. The neutral representation of the house
enforced by the MVLA and the highly charged re-
gional symbolism coopted by the Confederacy both
fed directly into the 1893 Virginia Building’s role
as a symbol of reconciliation with the Union and
Southern distinctiveness and post-Confederate pride.

The Lost Cause Meets the Colonial Revival
in Chicago

In their pursuit of this dual memory of Wash-
ington and his home, the promoters of the Virginia
Building relied on two different strategies for re-
membering the American past. The Lost Cause and
the colonial revival employed in the replica might
seem incompatible because of their respectively re-
gional and national focuses: one was interested en-
tirely in restructuring national memory, yet the
other intended to shape perceptions of white South-
ern culture, its defense of slavery, and its ultimate
defeat in the Civil War. In both strategies, however,
self-selected groups of Americans used retrospec-
tive and conservative methods for remembering
the nation’s past in order to feed particular con-
temporary needs. By the time of the 1893 Virginia
Building, the colonial revival appealed primarily to
a segment of the U.S. population very similar to the
group codifying the Lost Cause in the South: white,
native-born, and largely xenophobic Americans.
Whether reacting to industrial development, urban
growth, and the inﬂux of immigrants into Northern
cities, or regional patriotism and shifts in racial
hierarchies in Southern communities, middle- and
upper-class white Americans nationwide used sim-
ilarly idealized—even romantic—recollections of
the past as better, simpler times in their attempts to
maintain social dominance.52

The insistence on a particular reading of his-
tory was a central facet to the Lost Cause and co-
lonial revival, both of which worked to deﬁne a

‘‘correct’’ history that included some and excluded
others, in an effort to reassert control over an
increasingly heterogeneous and socially mobile
America. Various groups in the booming Northern
cities of the late nineteenth century enlisted the
colonial revival in their insistence that the signiﬁ-
cant history of America was that dominated by
native-born whites and their political and cultural
achievements. Patriotic ‘‘reeducation’’ began in the
1890s as waves of European immigrants threatened
the social stability of many northern communities.
Such efforts usually took the form of ‘‘American-
ization’’ campaigns that emphasized the founding
fathers and were conducted in colonial or colo-
nial revival buildings.53 Groups like the Sons of the
American Revolution (founded in 1889) and the
Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR; founded
in 1890) required proof of a genealogical connec-
tion to the Revolutionary heroes and at the same
time engaged in projects to publicly memorialize
their version of American history. Explicitly limit-
ing the stewardship of the past to those deemed
to ‘‘belong’’ was meant to control the character of
public memory. In these narratives, elites shaped
historical narratives in order to declare themselves
the rightful owners of American culture, past and
present.

As the Lost Cause developed later in the 1890s,
it also came to rely on many of the same strategies
as the colonial revival for shaping a particular pub-
lic memory.54 The efforts of the United Confederate
Veterans (UCV; active 1889–1951) and the United
Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC; founded
1894) focused on reframing the narratives of his-
tory textbooks to shine favorably on the role of
white Southerners in the nation’s history and to
quiet the evaluations of their secession as a ‘‘rebel-
lion.’’ Ultimately, such endeavors led to a cam-
paign to rename the Civil War ‘‘The War between
the States,’’ in an attempt to codify the conﬂict as
a dispute over states’ rights, rather than slavery,
both to mollify Northern detractors and to assuage
whites’ anxiety over contemporary race relations in
the South.55 In such histories, white slaveholders

were valiant and righteous, and African American
slaves were loyal and deferential, providing ex-
amples for how many Southerners hoped race
relations would continue into the twentieth cen-
tury. By deemphasizing the racial causes of the
Civil War and softening the realities of slavery,
Lost Cause efforts touted the idea that slavery
had been a benign institution and an issue upon
which all white America agreed. Such narratives
denied the struggle of African Americans under
slavery and the importance of emancipation, si-
multaneously downplaying the white South’s com-
plicity in the horrors of the institution and suggesting
that antebellum racial hierarchies could—and
should—persist into the present. The Virginia
Building enlisted both the Lost Cause and the
colonial revival to reinforce readings of American
history that were exclusive to Southerners (or white,
native-born Americans).

The colonial revival in American architecture,
as explained by architectural historian Vincent
Scully, was ‘‘something of a real desire for a new
simplicity, associated with an old simplicity, as well
as seeking for amplitude and ease.’’56 These con-
cepts were translated directly into the Virginia Build-
ing of 1893. At the Exposition’s Historical Congress,
a public lecturer pointed out the importance of co-
lonial Virginia to the nation: ‘‘From the pretty and
vivid picture [drawn] of the home-life of Washington,
we may learn how unpretentious the truly great
can dare to be, and the simple manner of living
chosen by the family of that honored son of old
Virginia. . . . It is really an enjoyment to be here to
witness the tranquil happiness that reigns through-
out the house.’’57 Nostalgia for a simpler lifestyle
found in ‘‘Old Virginia’’ (and especially in a home
of Old Virginia) was an effective foil to the dra-
matic technological and industrial innovations dis-
played at the World’s Columbian Exposition. For
the Virginia Building’s proponents, however, this
simplicity served also to soften the wounded pride
of the defeated Confederates and the radical racial
upheaval that was still taking place thirty years af-
ter the abolition of slavery and the social and eco-
nomic systems it supported. Remembering the
antebellum and Revolutionary periods as ‘‘pretty’’
and ‘‘tranquil’’ made the slavery-dependent, elite,

Southern culture something worth ﬁghting for in
hindsight and emulating in the future.

Going beyond ideology, the colonial revival
also provided the most likely examples of what the
presentation of the Virginia Building’s crafted past
was supposed to look like through two models: the
forms of the New England Kitchen exhibits estab-
lished in the 1860s and the interiors of Mount
Vernon as interpreted by the MVLA in the 1890s.
The New England Kitchen exhibit had already
proven itself as a successful strategy for interpret-
ing the colonial past at large expositions and world’s
fairs (ﬁg. 15).58 That the New England Kitchens
most likely served as a model for the 1893 Virginia
Building is ironic, since the ﬁrst such exhibits were

by 1893. The only public exhibit in existence by the time of the
World’s Columbian Exposition promoting exclusively Confed-
erate history and Lost Cause ideology was Memorial Hall in New
Orleans. The local museum opened in 1891 with a small number
of objects (mostly focusing on Jefferson Davis and his family) and
a support system limited to the New Orleans community of Con-
federate veterans and sympathizers. ‘‘Louisiana Historical Associ-

subsequent success at the 1876 Centennial Inter-
national Exposition and not far from the Virginia
Building on the World’s Columbian Exposition’s

have consistently been recognized as early expres-
sions of the colonial revival movement.60 Homey

of the Virginia Building were in keeping with the
New England Kitchen concept: objects were ar-
ranged to create the illusion of a domestic setting.
The Virginia Building also followed the New Eng-
land Kitchen model by showcasing the requisite
spinning wheel, possibly including a limited cafe-
teria serving colonial Virginia fare and featuring
a number of curiosities associated with historical
ﬁgures.62

The Virginia Building also followed the lead of
the New England Kitchens in its focus on interior
space. The earliest instances of the New England
Kitchen exhibits held at sanitary fairs were not
housed in their own buildings; each was merely a
room. Although later examples, such as the New
England Kitchen built for the Centennial, were free-
standing buildings meant to look vaguely like log
cabins from the outside, attention and activity con-
tinued to be concentrated on the buildings’ interiors.63
Emphasis at the Virginia Building was similarly
internally focused, a quality enhanced by the loca-
tion of the replica; its rear elevation faced a steep
hill and an elevated rail line at the back of the north-
east corner of the fair (ﬁgs. 16–18). This Mount
Vernon functioned more as a fac¸ade for a re-created
interior than it did as a complete replica in the
round.

Most nineteenth-century colonial revival re-
creations of American domestic interiors—includ-
ing the Virginia Building and most likely the later
New England Kitchens—were also based on the
MVLA’s interpretation of Mount Vernon as a home
rather than as a museum.64 As architectural histo-
rian Richard Guy Wilson has argued, the MVLA’s
quest to save and preserve Mount Vernon in the
1850s was a colonial revival effort in itself. The MVLA’s
choice to return Mount Vernon to its former glory
as Washington’s home was a deﬁning moment in
the development of the colonial revival before the
Civil War, especially considering the subsequent
inﬂuence the house had on American domestic

architecture.65 Soon after the end of the war, the
MVLA began reconstructing paint color schemes
and collecting objects signiﬁcant to Washington
in order to re-create many of the building’s spaces
as they believed them to have been during
Washington’s lifetime.66 In the early 1870s, Ann
Pamela Cunningham spoke publicly of her belief
that ‘‘the mansion and the grounds around it should
be religiously guarded from change—should be
kept as Washington left them.’’67 Rather than dis-
play objects in cases as was typical of late nineteenth-
century museums such as the Smithsonian, the
furniture and memorabilia in Mount Vernon were
most often arranged to reﬂect the MVLA’s vision of
what Washington’s functioning household had
been like (ﬁg. 19).68 These early interior restora-
tions later came to serve as a model not only for the
Virginia Building but also for America’s house
museums and as a precursor to the period-room
movement that blossomed out of colonial revival
preservation efforts in the 1910s (usually led by or-
ganizations also based on the MVLA model).69

The Virginia Building’s reliance on Mount
Vernon and the New England Kitchen as models is
also evident in the extensive list of domestic objects
included in the exhibit, arranged to simulate colo-
nial interiors.70 Private individuals loaned the ar-
ticles shown in the domestic re-creations, reinforcing
the concept that the public memory was preserved
in the private sphere.71 Private individuals con-
trolled the vision of Washington and his home
both in Chicago and at Mount Vernon in Virginia.
That the Mount Vernon replica included articles
signiﬁcant to both the colonial and the Civil War
eras was indicative not only of the way in which the
two histories were intertwined in Southern mem-
ory, but also that the memory being displayed was

lier, it becomes even clearer that the domestic
arrangements of the Mount Vernon replica were
consciously based on colonial revival models. The
Virginia Building might have been created by the
same cohort of Virginians as was behind the Mu-
seum of the Confederacy, but the participants did
not use the same display methods or types of objects.
Descriptions of both the Museum of the Con-
federacy and the Virginia Building relied upon the
term ‘‘relic’’ to describe objects displayed within
the respective exhibits. Promoters, visitors, and re-
porters often used the word indiscriminately to
describe not only articles with direct associations
to the ‘‘martyrs’’ of the Confederate cause or those
with connections to the almost religiously revered
Washington, but also things that were simply ‘‘old.’’
The types of relics displayed in these two venues by
a similar group of Lost Cause sympathizers, how-
ever, were markedly different. Those exhibited in
the Virginia Building included a number of house-
hold items or photographs related to historic person-
ages such as Washington, Lee, Davis, and Jefferson,
in addition to furniture and other articles that had
no particular associational value and were present
merely to complete the domestic re-creation. An
ofﬁcial guidebook of the fair described the exhibit:

In the main hall is a large stairway four feet wide, as-
cending by platforms to the room above. On the ﬁrst
platform of the stairway there is an old Washington
family clock, a very interesting historical relic. This hall

is furnished with antique sofas and pictures of the last
century. . . . As far as could be done the building was fur-
nished with articles which were collected from all over
the state, the heirlooms of old Virginia families, and with
portraits of the same character. Whatever may be lacking
in furnishing the building with articles of this charac-
ter is supplied with furniture made after the same old
fashion.74

The list of furniture not associated with a famous
Virginia personage included pianos, spinning wheels,
washstands, and ‘‘old chairs.’’75 In fact, a high-post
bedstead with bedding was even donated by William
B. Holtzclaw, a Chicagoan who was also the build-
ing’s contractor.76 In the case of some rooms in
the replica, not enough appropriate objects could
be collected, and the spaces were subsequently

closed.77 Rather than sacriﬁce the illusion of ﬁdelity,
the Virginia Building’s furnishings both remained
sparse and included objects without associational
value so that the exhibit would reﬂect a viable home.
The Museum of the Confederacy’s collection of
relics, meanwhile, consisted overwhelmingly of ar-
ticles (or pieces of articles) related to speciﬁc indi-
viduals who had sacriﬁced their blood for the cause.
Typical were ‘‘pressed ﬂowers from the casket con-
taining the remains of General Robert E. Lee’’;
‘‘cotton, used by [ Jefferson] Davis in dressing his
wounded foot’’; a ‘‘piece of Wedding-Gown of el-

erans and their steeds.78 Despite the fact that the

Museum of the Confederacy would come to be
housed in an actual residence once it opened in
1896 (the ‘‘White House’’ of the Confederacy, the
home of Jefferson Davis and his family during the
Civil War) and followed the MVLA’s practice of
assigning each room in the museum to a different
state’s set of representatives, it did not attempt to
re-create any domestic spaces as did the real Mount
Vernon or its replica. It was instead arranged ac-
cording to the prevailing anthropological princi-
ples that dominated Victorian museum display.79
Cases were crammed with these often dirty or blood-
stained articles, and photographs, paintings, and
torn battle ﬂags covered the walls (ﬁg. 20). It is in-
teresting to note that the only items included in the
Virginia Building that come close to the highly
charged and fragmented articles typical of the Mu-

seum of Confederacy were ‘‘quilt pieces, made from
Mrs. Washington’s dress,’’ and an old medicine
chest ‘‘made from a plank taken from Washington’s
ﬁrst cofﬁn.’’80 Although both articles might have
begun their lives as disjointed, association-driven
relics, they ultimately became more practical ob-
jects that blended in with the domestic nature of
the Mount Vernon exhibit, their genealogy enhanc-
ing their authenticity.

Through this comparison of historical objects
collected by similarly minded individuals, it becomes
clear that the ‘‘curators’’ of the Virginia Building
made a conscious decision to simulate a house—
and more speciﬁcally, the real Mount Vernon—in
the choice and arrangement of objects. This brought
the replica closer to its model, Mount Vernon, and
aligned the project with colonial revival efforts that

had already been proven successful. By opting to
avoid war-torn and bloodstained Confederate relics
in the exhibit, the sponsors of the Virginia Build-
ing further ensured a palatable and successful pre-
sentation of their particular memory of Virginia’s
history. Perhaps the completely domestic quality
of the replica also sent the message that home was
something that all Americans had—or aspired to
have—in common. The ‘‘old-tyme’’ interiors of the
Virginia Building created a familiar realm in which
its promoters’ crafted and complicated memory
was normalized.

The ‘‘Women of Virginia’’ Replicate
Mount Vernon

Women largely planned, created, and operated the
Virginia Building, furthering its domestic orien-
tation. This situates the replica within the period’s
proliferation of organizations of white women aimed
at crafting public memory and championing his-
toric preservation: from the colonial revival–oriented
New England Kitchens or MVLA, to the Lost
Cause–driven founders of the Museum of the Con-
federacy and other local groups that had formed
in the South by the mid- and late 1890s as a strategy
to support the cultural authority of white elites.81
The popular understanding that historical steward-
ship began in the home allowed women to lead these
campaigns without explicitly entering the mascu-
line world of politics.82 Hence, the Virginia legis-
lature handed over the fundraising and publicity
campaigns for the Mount Vernon replica to ‘‘the
women of Virginia’’ as early as 1891.83 After the

81 Women dominated historic preservation efforts from the
late nineteenth century through the ﬁrst decades of the twen-
tieth century. See Daniel Bluestone, ‘‘Academics in Tennis Shoes:

General Assembly agreed to appropriate $25,000
to the project in the spring of 1892, it was resolved
that the women of Virginia were to ‘‘render every
assistance to this laudable undertaking’’ of raising
additional funds and be ‘‘delegated the patriotic
duty of raising a fund to duplicate at Chicago,
Mount Vernon, the home of Washington, as the
Virginia Building.’’84 As was often the case in the
nineteenth century, politicians delegated the task
of memorializing the past to women.85

The 1893 Virginia Building and the women
promoting it were also associated with the largest
and most active female group behind many co-
lonial revival efforts to craft public memory: the
Daughters of the American Revolution. The very
proposition to include a replica of Mount Vernon
in the 1893 Exposition at all was ﬁrst publicized by
the DAR. In January of 1892, a nationwide com-
mittee of the DAR announced that it was planning
on exhibiting ‘‘the manners, customs, and domes-
tic life of the revolutionary or colonial period’’ in a
house that would ‘‘probably be Mount Vernon, but
its furnishings will be entirely from the contribu-
tions of the descendants of the Revolutionary heroes,
or those persons having historic furniture.’’86 A year
earlier, the DAR contacted the MVLA to suggest
that the two groups collaborate in their contri-
bution to the Women’s Building’s ‘‘Retrospective
Department,’’ although it is unclear if they ever
approached the MVLA formally about the intended
replica.87 In the end, the DAR did not have a sep-
arate building at the fair but only an exhibit in the
Women’s Building that included information about
their accomplishments in preservation, ﬁnding the
lost graves of American patriots, genealogical re-
search, and relic collecting.88

It seems likely that the Virginia Building’s fe-
male proponents who were also members of the
DAR adopted the idea of the Mount Vernon rep-
lica. The Virginia Building’s hostess and the Lady

Assistant to the World’s Fair Board of Managers of
Virginia, Lucy Preston Beale, was a prominent mem-
ber of the DAR; she would be elected as an honorary
vice president for life by the organization in 1896.89
Clearly, the replica and Beale’s involvement with
it were deemed of interest to the national DAR
membership; one of Beale’s trips to Mount Vernon
to inspect the MVLA’s interpretation was reported
in the DAR’s ofﬁcial magazine in the same month
that the fair opened.90 Another woman who was
both closely connected to the public image of the
Virginia Building and a member of the DAR was
Sara Rice Pryor (1830–1912). Pryor donated ob-
jects shown in the replica, hosted a ball at White
Sulphur Springs to raise money for the endeavor,
and participated in other aspects of the project’s
planning.91

By codifying one version of the historical (and
especially political) contributions of white men
such as George Washington, the women involved
in the Virginia Building and similar efforts to shape
public memory simultaneously sought to solidify
their own role in largely male-dominated narratives
as wives and mothers.92 Like Martha Washington
before them, Virginia women such as Beale and
Pryor intended to be models of American domestic
morality to inspire patriotism not only in their own
republican sons but also across the entire nation.
By emphasizing the contribution of Virginia’s women
in the domestic realm, Beale and her compatriots
tried to ensure their place in both state and national
histories. Beale wrote to Virginia women in a pro-
motional pamphlet for the Virginia Building: ‘‘We
see that in other States, statistics are being gathered
illustrative of woman’s help in the moral and intel-
lectual progress of the State, as well as her more
material interests. Have Virginia women been idle
in these noble ﬁelds? . . . Is there nothing in the way
of the garden, the dairy, the orchard, or of domes-
tic ordering that has received special impress at her
hand?’’93 Beale clearly saw the World’s Columbian
Exposition as an opportunity to promote the role
of Virginia women in the state’s progress to date.

In another broadside, Beale spoke directly to the
ways in which the state’s female population would
ensure that the Virginia Building would lead the
state into the future: ‘‘Poor though we be, let the
women of Virginia, with a patriotic pride that may
brook humiliation, tax themselves to signalize this
anniversary of the New World’s birth . . . let us now
feel, and demonstrate to others, that to the beloved
‘old land’ life has indeed come again.’’94 Beale’s
declarations raised awareness of not only the Mount
Vernon replica as a domestic endeavor but also the
work of Virginia’s women.

In stark contrast to women touting suffrage
rights and new roles for women elsewhere at the
World’s Columbian Exposition, the female-led cam-
paign for the Virginia Building, its re-creations of
colonial interiors, and Lucy Preston Beale’s em-
phasis on women’s achievements in the traditional
domestic realm served as reminders that both in the
Old South and in the New, Virginia’s white women
excelled in the home and that, in that space, gender
roles were as they had been in Washington’s time.95
The Virginia Building and its re-creations of colo-
nial interiors represented the state, and especially
its women, as examples of tried, true, and uncontro-
versial domestic values. Beale and her counterparts
continued to tout this claim in the Virginia exhibit
two years later at the 1895 Atlanta Cotton States Ex-
position, a venture devoted entirely to showcasing
the New South. In a special edition of The Virginian
released for the Atlanta Exposition and edited by
Beale, the simultaneous pronouncement of the power
of Virginian women and of the reassurance of tra-
ditional gender roles is clear: ‘‘In contrast with other
women of our own country . . . the repose—the
poise of manner—claimed as the Virginia Woman’s
peculiar characteristic . . . the Virginia Woman
is Queen in the ‘Old Dominion.’ Home is her
Kingdom.’’96

The Virginia Building’s Lost Cause Proponents

The elite women and men who created the Vir-
ginia Building might have relied on colonial revival
models for their domestically focused demonstra-
tion of Washington’s memory, but they also were
and had been ﬁrmly entrenched in various section-
alist memorial efforts throughout the nineteenth
century, from the construction of Confederate na-
tionalism to the public displays of the Lost Cause.
They donated objects to the Virginia Building,
designed its architecture, crafted its narrative, and
hosted its guests in Chicago, all while leading Con-
federate veteran organizations, building monuments
to its generals and fallen soldiers, and publicly
expressing their fears for the fate of their fellow
white Southerners in the decades after Reconstruc-
tion back in Virginia. In the Virginia Building, they
together created a nationally palatable version of
the same narrative they memorialized on a regional
level and often for local audiences. An examination
of the biographies of some of the Virginia Build-
ing’s major promoters suggests that their simulta-
neous leadership in the Lost Cause and their care
in presenting a depoliticized vision of the past to
the nation are indicative of the ways in which the
ideologies of Southern distinctiveness and national
reconciliation were entwined in the replica of 1893.
Like many of the Virginia Building’s proponents,
Edgerton Stewart Rogers—the building’s architect—
was a member of a long-standing, well-known
Richmond family (ﬁg. 21).97 Rogers’s professional
obituary in the Inland Architect and News Record cites
his mother, Miss Rosa Gibson, a famous beauty and
belle of the 1850s, as one of the catalysts behind his
success.98 Her family connected Rogers to the pin-
nacles of antebellum Richmond society. Rogers’s
father, sculptor Randolph Rogers, meanwhile, in-
troduced him to the city’s artistic community.99
Randolph Rogers completed the ﬁgures located
around the base of Richmond’s equestrian statue
of George Washington (the very center of Confed-
erate imagery) after sculptor Thomas Crawford’s

was working and studying sculpture. He received his own training
in Europe and returned to Richmond, his mother’s hometown,
by 1887 or 1888.

Edgerton Stewart Rogers received the 1893
Virginia Building commission ‘‘from among a very
large number of competitors, and by unanimous
vote,’’ most likely because of his family connections
and because he often socialized with members of
the state’s Board of World’s Fair Managers in vari-

the society also reﬂected its allegiances to the Lost

of the Confederacy (ﬁg. 22). The Westmoreland

Richmond home of Maymont, which was another
of Rogers’s signiﬁcant commissions.

as hostess for a building that bridged colonial and
Confederate history: she was a direct descendant
of William Preston, a member of the House of
Burgesses, and James Patton Preston, a distinguished
army colonel and an early nineteenth-century
governor of Virginia. Her father, William Ballard
Preston, served as a senator in the Confederate
Congress.106 Beale’s family was regarded as one of
the ‘‘oldest and wealthiest families’’ of antebellum
southwestern Virginia planter society—a group
of Southerners that surely had the most to gain by
the reframing of the Civil War’s memory and out-
comes.107 Beale also joined the UDC soon after the
group was founded in 1894.108

Other Virginians invested in the Lost Cause
made contributions to the Virginia Building. John
S. Wise (1846–1913), the son of antebellum Vir-
ginia governor Henry Alexander Wise, donated a
signiﬁcant number of relics to the Mount Vernon
project. Wise had been a distinguished young Con-
federate soldier and claimed in his nostalgic mem-
oir that after the war, ‘‘I was dead . . . My beloved
State of Virginia was dismembered, and a new
State had been erected out of a part of her, against
her will.’’109 He was a member of the Westmoreland
Club and also of the Light Infantry Blues, a militia
that merged with Edgerton Stewart Rogers’s Ashby
Light Horse Guard in 1894 and contracted uni-
forms that replicated those worn by the battalion in
the Civil War.110 The group’s ﬂag was christened
at the 1890 unveiling of the Monument Avenue
Robert E. Lee Monument.111 Wise’s wife, Evelyn
Douglas Wise, was elected United States Lady Man-
ager of the Auxiliary Board of the World’s Fair
Board of Managers of Virginia and served along-
side Beale.

A former Confederate general himself, ex-
Virginia governor and Virginia Building supporter
Fitzhugh Lee (1835–1905) was also deeply en-
trenched in Lost Cause ideology (ﬁg. 23).112 Lee
was also a member of the Westmoreland Club, where
he most likely yielded considerable inﬂuence over
the legislators determining the state’s involvement

in the World’s Columbian Exposition.113 As gov-
ernor of Virginia from 1886 to 1890, Lee had led
the state’s Democratic Party in their disenfranchise-
ment of the state’s African American population in
an attempt to deny some of the civil rights gained
since emancipation.114 He published a biography
of his uncle, General Robert E. Lee, and spear-
headed the Lee Monument Association that erected
Monument Avenue’s ﬁrst memorial to the Confed-
erate hero in 1890.115 Although all of the Virginia
Building’s chief proponents were deeply entrenched
in the Lost Cause, Lee was undoubtedly the most
widely known and publicly associated with the
movement.

replica’s presentation at the World’s Columbian
Exposition was understood as an opportunity to
promote the New South. Lee’s leadership in the
development of Monument Avenue ﬁrmly posited
him as a promoter of a New South Richmond by
1893; he established not only the project’s com-
memorative purpose but also its role as a real estate
development that would promote the expansion
and redevelopment of a ruined Richmond and the
collection of city tax revenue.116 Monument Avenue
was the new showcase of the formerly defeated and
ruined Confederate capitol; it supposedly touted
the city’s progressivism, desire to regain its rightful
place in the nation’s economic life, and its success-
ful efforts to compete with newer Southern cities
and Northern urban centers.117 Appropriately, this
effort toward reconciliation was accompanied by
a less strident position in Lost Cause ideology.118
Gone were the ﬁerce debates about how and why
the Civil War had started and where the South had
gone wrong; what emerged was a softened and for-
giving attitude about the Civil War, which both fa-
cilitated North and South moving forward together
and continued to ease the South’s memory of their
defeat.119 The Lost Cause of the 1890s stressed the
idea that the Confederacy had been politically
conservative. This was a throwback to the Confed-
erate argument that in seceding, they had merely
been following the Constitutional principles—states’
rights—laid out by Washington, Jefferson, and the
rest of the (notably Virginia-born) founding fa-
thers.120 The Virginia Building’s participants and
promoters continued this ‘‘conservative’’ mantra as
part of New South progressivism. Similar to Beale’s
celebration of Virginia’s traditional women, it was
especially important for the state to appear poli-
tically conservative at the World’s Columbian Ex-
position, where Virginia’s natural, technological,
and historical resources were paraded in front of
national and international audiences that could
potentially greatly inﬂuence the state’s future. On
the fair’s Virginia Day, Fitzhugh Lee’s speech typ-
iﬁed the intermingling of the New South mantra
with the cultural politics of the Lost Cause:

The questions of who ﬁred the ﬁrst gun in the past or
who compelled the ﬁrst gun to be ﬁred in the war be-

Winterthur Portfolio 43:1

tween the States, sinks from sight when confronted with
the living questions of to-day—Who shall be ﬁrst in mak-
ing nuggets of gold bound from the mountain sides and
ribbons of silver unwind in the hills? . . . Who shall lead
in preserving our institutions by keeping the Govern-
ment anchored to the simple forms laid down by our
forefathers, and who shall best guard the reserved rights
of the States and support without reserve the delegated
powers of the Government of the United States?121

Lee’s speech urged the nation to put aside the
ﬁerce debates about how and why the Civil War
started and went wrong for the South in an effort to
reconcile and prosper as a nation, yet he also em-
phasized the need to maintain vigilance of states’
rights, a subtle suggestion that the South was still
somewhat autonomous. Somehow, Southern loy-
alty to the principles of states’ rights made the for-
mer Confederacy closer to the founding fathers,
justifying its decision to secede and maintenance
of a speciﬁc regional culture after its defeat.

That white Virginians were willing to partic-
ipate in the World’s Columbian Exposition at all
was indicative of the ways in which the elite white
South was reconsidering its secessionist past as well
as its current role in a national economy and cul-
ture. In contrast, Virginia and the rest of the South
had been largely unwilling to participate in the
Centennial International Exposition held in Phil-
adelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1876, state funds were
scarce due to postwar debt and the cost of rebuild-
ing, and the wounds of the Civil War were still too
fresh, having been deepened by the humiliation
of Reconstruction. While most Northern states
erected freestanding buildings at the Centennial,
Mississippi and Arkansas were the only Southern
states that participated with ofﬁcially funded and
sanctioned structures. In Virginia, a very public de-
bate made it clear that many whites were offended
by the same infraction that they claimed as the rea-
son to secede in the 1860s: the federal government’s
intrusion on states’ rights. Virginia senators argued
that to force individual state governments to fund
a world’s fair (an entity created by the federal gov-
ernment that functioned like a private corporation)
was against their rights as a commonwealth.122 An

indicated the strong racism that prevented Virginia’s
participation in the Centennial; it claimed that the
state should have no part in a fair that aimed to
‘‘make white people out of negroes.’’123 Many white
Southerners refused to participate in a fair that
presented whites and blacks as equal citizens so
soon after emancipation. In the end, Virginia was
recognized at the Centennial only by a small build-
ing erected by a private individual. Although Vir-
ginian A. R. Butler expressed the hope at the fair’s
1873 groundbreaking ceremony that ‘‘whatever
differences there may have been in the past, they
now recognize no other point for their patriotism
but the ﬂag of their country,’’ sectionalism divided
the Centennial and thwarted any hopes for its use
as a reconciliatory event.124

By the time of the World’s Columbian Exposi-
tion, it was clear that the Southern states had to
participate in the fair in order to take advantage
of the nation’s cultural, industrial, and ﬁnancial
growth.125 Bigger and far more international than
the 1876 Centennial, the 1893 Columbian Expo-
sition promised unparalleled exposure for the South’s
resources and, as the Virginia Building’s promot-
ers hoped, the public acceptance of a new, post-
Reconstruction identity. Such visibility made the
participation and success of such Southern exhib-
its imperative. The importance of Virginia’s repre-
sentation at the World’s Columbian Exposition was
central to calls for Southern participation in the fair
as early as 1891. Those who insisted on Virginia’s
representation wanted not only to promote natural
resources and ﬁnancial viability but also to remind
the Union of her richness in history.126 Lieutenant
Governor Major J. Hoge Tyler listed Virginia’s his-
torical contributions to the Union as one of the
main reasons for participating in the event: ‘‘What
would the history of our country be if the his-
tory of Virginia was left out? To have her left out
of that grand gathering of the sisterhood of States
would indeed be like the play of Hamlet without

124 A. R. Butler, quoted in ‘‘The National Centennial,’’ New
York Times, July 5, 1873, 5. In contrast to a lack of participation by
the Southern states, however, was the response by Northern, and
especially New England, states. In fact, Connecticut erected a
colonial revival building meant to provide an example of how the
state’s earliest residents had lived, foreshadowing the strategy
adopted by Virginians when they ﬁnally participated in a world’s
fair in 1893. See Wilson, The Colonial Revival House, 39.

central to the history of the United States, could
not be omitted from such a monumental event.

Memory, Mount Vernon, and Race

By choosing a plantation house to represent them-
selves at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the
Virginia Building’s proponents would at ﬁrst glance
seem to be entirely dependent on the Lost Cause
and its calls for the ‘‘South to rise again’’ in public
memory. However, their choice of such a recogniz-
able symbol of the plantation South was also part of
a reconciliation-oriented strategy of selective mem-
ory. As historian David W. Blight has argued, post-
Reconstruction white America pursued a narrative
of reunion that focused on mutual loss and white
supremacy rather than the racial motivations or
results of the Civil War.128 Elite whites throughout
the nation highlighted and promoted romanticized
memories of the antebellum South because race
was such a socially and politically divisive issue that
it threatened to prevent reunion between North
and South after Reconstruction.129 Accordingly,
both Lost Cause advocates and New South boosters
‘‘shared a refurbished commitment to white sup-
remacy’’ that was understood as necessary for white
America to move forward together both econom-
ically and in memory.130 Many Southern whites
also espoused ideas of white supremacy in their
attempts to regain political and social control after
the Reconstruction-era efforts to establish an equal
African American population.131 A ﬁctional narra-
tive of a benign slavery was believed to foster not
only the idea that antebellum racial hierarchies
had been positive social forces and were meant to
continue, but also that slavery had not been a po-
litical issue in the years leading up to the Civil War.
The Lost Cause rhetoric of the Virginia Building,
therefore, was both a means to soften history for
Southerners and a means to form a memory of the
South around which all white Americans could
unite.

One of the most common ways in which whites
romanticized memories of slavery in order to shape
contemporary racial issues was the idea of the faith-
ful slave.132 Deriving from antebellum fantasies of
faithful, happy slaves typiﬁed by the Stearns paint-
ing previously discussed and promoted by the pro-
slavery movement, such images were central to the
Lost Cause movement. In these fabricated visions,
antebellum African Americans had not only sub-
mitted to the racial hierarchy of slavery but also
relished the supposed protection and care lavished
upon them by their white masters. Fictionalized
slaves returned to their masters after emancipation
or refused to leave the plantation at the end of the
Civil War; much like children, these characters
were imagined to both love and need their masters.
This late nineteenth-century memory demonstrated
the desire of many white Americans—and especially
Southerners—for a return to clear social hierarchies.
It occurred simultaneously with a rise in lynching:
extreme and violent attempts by whites to control
African American communities and to assert racial
hierarchy through fear.133 The coupling of an era-
sure of emancipation from the historical narrative
with the idea that slaves had ﬂourished under the
institution was also simultaneous with Jim Crow
laws in the South and segregation legislation through-
out the nation. Such politically sanctioned racism
was meant to reassert racial hierarchies through the
denial of a number of the civil rights that African
Americans had gained since the 1860s by essentially
ignoring emancipation as a historical fact.

The fabricated memory of antebellum race rela-
tions was exempliﬁed by the memoir of Sarah Rice
Pryor, one of Lucy Preston Beale’s assistants in
the planning and execution of the 1893 Virginia
Building. Pryor published My Day: Reminiscences
of a Long Life in 1909 as part of a series of auto-
biographies of her life on a Virginia plantation and
as the wife of a Confederate colonel in the Civil
War.134 Pryor’s account of her interaction with an

enslaved man, John, during the war is indicative of
the themes she pursued consistently throughout
her books:

One day John presented himself with a heart-broken
countenance and a drooping attitude of deep dejection.
He had a sad story to tell. The agent of the estate to which
he belonged was in town, and John had been commis-
sioned to inform me that all the slaves belonging to the
estate were to be immediately transferred to a Louisiana
plantation for safety . . . The poor fellow broke down. ‘‘It
will kill me,’’ he declared. ‘‘I’ll soon die on that plan-
tation.’’ All the affectionate, faithful service, all his hard-
ships for our sakes, rushed upon my memory. I bade
[he] put me in communication with the agent. I found
that I could save the boy only by buying him! . . . Re-
membered to-day, this seems a wonderful act on my
part.135

Pryor’s account is dependent upon the idea of
the faithful slave, and her act of magnanimity—
resulting in John remaining in the place he sup-
posedly loved so much—was only possible through
her participation in slave trading; the story, there-
fore, provides an example of how the institution
could be ‘‘good’’ for African American slaves and a
softened memory of society that the Confederacy
lost so many lives to defend. By depicting slavery as
a positive thing, Pryor and others like her denied
the very foundation of late nineteenth-century ra-
cial tension.

The 1893 Virginia Building furthered this late
nineteenth-century narrative of a benign antebel-
lum racial hierarchy by imitating a working plan-
tation, complete with both mistress and slaves. The
simulation of not only plantation architecture but
also plantation life carried the reconciliation-oriented
political agenda of the building and its promoters
to the experiential level and provided an example
of the beautiful and peaceful life under slavery that
Pryor and the Virginia Building’s other promoters
imagined. The prospective exhibit was described
in the Washington Post in 1892 in terms of the ol-
factory experiences, human interactions, and emo-
tional suggestions of the replica that evoked the
Mount Vernon of George Washington’s day: ‘‘Mount
Vernon at Chicago means the house of home-life,
hospitable welcome, latch string hanging out. Vir-
ginia kitchen, bacon beaten biscuit, servants in at-
tendance, and all the other belongings of that
ancient mansion, where the Father of His Country
dispensed hospitality.’’136 Guidebooks and histories

of the fair also consistently commented on the do-
mestic atmosphere and its human representatives,
the ‘‘old Virginia negroes’’ that Lucy Preston Beale
hired as attendants.137

Beale greeted guests of the Virginia Building
and acted as its spokesperson; in Virginia’s ofﬁcial
report made at the fair’s conclusion, her ‘‘thought-
ful and genial hospitality’’ was credited with ‘‘what-
ever social advantages, attentions and comforts
Virginians have received at the Mt. Vernon.’’138
Beale loaned numerous pieces of furniture to the
replica to complete its domestic simulation, includ-
ing a mahogany dressing case with a looking glass,
a bureau, and a washstand.139 These objects were
directly from another real plantation house,
Smithﬁeld, the Preston family seat in Blacksburg,
Virginia.140 Beale’s position as the mistress of this
former plantation house linked her and the ob-
jects she brought with her to Chicago to a very
particular planter elite version of Old Virginia
and distinguished her from other state buildings’
hostesses.

The interpretation of African American actors
in the Virginia Building’s simulation also furthered
the racial implications of the building as a working
version of Mount Vernon and, thus, as a continu-
ance of slavery. ‘‘Sarah Washington’’ served as the
building’s janitress. Although she is listed in the
Chicago Daily Tribune as being the wife of Mount
Vernon cook John A. Washington, recent scholar-
ship has speculated that ‘‘Mrs. Beale’s attendant’’
was more likely Sarah Robinson, a contemporary
employee of the MVLA who helped to maintain
Mount Vernon as a tourist attraction.141 A news-
paper reporter, assuming that Sarah’s last name
must be ‘‘Washington’’ in order to conﬁrm her con-
nection to Mount Vernon, made the interpretation
of a simulated slavery clear: ‘‘Sarah Washington . . .
a direct descendant of the old Washington house
servants, proud of her name and of the worthy an-
cestors who adopted it. She is grave, digniﬁed, and
courteous as becomes her place and name, and in
her one may behold a typical survival of the servant

of the old school.’’142 This interpretation empha-
sized the Virginia Building as a plantation, a domes-
tic environment dependent on the labor of African
American slaves. By eluding emancipation, the 1893
Virginia Building’s presentation of race relations
disregarded the late nineteenth-century role of
African Americans and the signiﬁcance of the Civil
War, just as Jim Crow laws denied blacks equal
rights. By suggesting that Sarah was a ‘‘Washington’’
and thus a member of a slave family that had per-
sisted at Mount Vernon since the antebellum pe-
riod, the Virginia Building presented a real-life
version of the faithful slave ideal: Sarah Washington
(or her ancestors) had not ﬂed the scene of her
bondage when given the chance. She had instead
remained at Mount Vernon—her home—long af-
ter emancipation, serving the whites who actually
owned and controlled the plantation.

Discussions of racial hierarchies elsewhere on
the grounds of the World’s Columbian Exposition
further complicated the interpretation of the Vir-
ginia Building as a working plantation. There were
a number of voices in the discourse on race at the
1893 fair other than the romanticized view of ante-
bellum racial hierarchies exempliﬁed by the Mount
Vernon replica. Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells,
and other notable African Americans used the Ex-
position as a platform to promote black achieve-
ments to a wide audience and speak out against
racism in contemporary America, as well as to de-
bate the African American role in society and in
the Exposition itself.143 The range of African Amer-
ican involvement in and reactions to the World’s
Columbian Exposition contrasted with the idea of
the faithful slave promoted by the interpretation of
Sarah Washington. While blacks at the fair were ac-
tively engaged in political and social debates about
race relations and other contemporary issues, the in-
terpretation of Sarah’s role at the Virginia Building
denied black agency. Rather than acknowledge a con-
temporary South in which blacks were paid employ-
ees and equal citizens, the Virginia Building implied
the persistence of antebellum racial hierarchies.

provided one of the most powerful complements
to the simulated slavery of the Virginia Building.
Exhibits such as the Dahomeyan Village fabricated
allegedly authentic representations of African life-
ways intended to reinforce ideas about the supremacy
of white civilization over ‘‘savage’’ and ‘‘uncivilized’’
cultures.144 In their presentation of contemporary
Africa, such ‘‘Darkest Africa’’ exhibits encouraged
a comparison to African American culture—in both
the nation’s past and present.145 Some whites used
this evaluation to strengthen the white supremacist
movement to suppress the legal, social, and polit-
ical rights of African Americans; supporters pro-

moted the idea that if African peoples were inher-
ently savage, then their lesser roles in racial hier-
archies were naturally determined.146 In accordance
with Blight’s interpretation, however, the juxta-
position between the ‘‘servant[s] of the old school’’
at the Virginia Building and the ‘‘savages’’ on the
Midway could also have been used as further proof
for the position that slavery had been a benign in-
stitution. Returning to the antebellum arguments
of the proslavery movement, the direct comparison
of ‘‘savage’’ Africans and ‘‘civilized’’ slaves bol-
stered the idea that contact with white civilization

through slavery had bettered the African race.
The Virginia Building’s representation of the plan-
tation culture of Mount Vernon also served the
racial agenda that permeated the fair.

Conclusion

The Virginia Building’s replication of Mount
Vernon and dependence on a memory of George
Washington might seem like obvious choices for
the state’s representation at the 1893 World’s Co-
lumbian Exposition: the building was a relatively
simple one to reproduce, and Washington was the
state’s most beloved son. Yet the Virginia Build-
ing’s promoters also saw their re-creation of Mount
Vernon as an opportunity to add a widely agreed
upon set of national symbols to their new Lost Cause
narrative. Virginia’s former Confederates’ use of
a nationally venerated icon allowed them both to
reenter the national dialogue and to retain pride in
historic Southern culture as they wished to remem-
ber it. Mount Vernon instilled pride in the hearts
of many of its Virginian visitors and reminded
guests from other states that the Old Dominon had
been central to the nation’s beginnings and would
continue to lead the United States into the future.
The exhibit was tremendously successful; the fair’s

tram often emptied at the ‘‘Mount Vernon’’ stop
located just behind the Virginia Building.147 While
glowing reviews from reporters and period histo-
rians abound in the descriptions and accounts of
the replica of Mount Vernon, the most palpable
surviving evidence of the success of the building
and its complicated narrative is the guest register
(ﬁg. 24). An enormous, heavy volume now housed
in the Library of Virginia, the Virginia Building’s
visitor log was entirely full of the names and home-
towns of its guests months before the fair ended. Af-
ter touring the cool, simulated interiors and perhaps
meeting Lucy Preston Beale or Sarah ‘‘Washington,’’
these guests left the shady porch of the mansion on
the Potomac and reentered the teeming crowds
wondering at technological and cultural inno-
vation throughout Chicago’s Jackson Park. The
exhibit’s promoters hoped that with them, these
visitors carried the impression that the Virginia of
today and of tomorrow was socially and politically
conservative, economically and historically signiﬁ-
cant, and as steadfastly beautiful and graceful as
it had been in Washington’s day. The state might
have been ready to reconcile with the North, but it
would always be ‘‘old Virginny.’’
