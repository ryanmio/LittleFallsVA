# Evolving Perspectives on Virginia's Paleoindian Record

## Joseph A. M. Gingerich and William A. Childress

Virginia has one of the largest inventories of fluted points in the Southeast. Sites such as Cactus Hill, Thunderbird, and Williamson have heavily influenced our understanding of the colonization of eastern North America, Paleoindian settlement patterns, and changes in Paleoindian technology. This chapter discusses new sites, fluted point distributions, analyses of fluted point metrics, and Paleoindian settlement models.

## THE VIRGINIAN PALEOINDIAN RECORD

There are a few reported pre-Clovis sites in Virginia (Johnson and Childress 2013; McAvoy 1992; McAvoy and McAvoy 2015; McDonald 2000), but fluted points (n = ~1,100) are widely distributed across the state. Gingerich and Wagner (2017), using fluted point metrics from the Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA), suggest that 468 points can reasonably be assigned to the Clovis or the Early Paleoindian period (pre-12,800 cal BP). Another 152 points with deeply indented bases and longer or multiple flutes are considered post-Clovis. These data suggest a recurring trend of a decrease in the frequency of fluted points following Clovis in the Southeast (Anderson et al. 2011; Gingerich and Wagner 2017; Miller and Gingerich 2013b; Smallwood et al. 2015). The decline in fluted point counts has largely been attributed to the Younger Dryas, a brief but abrupt reversal to cooler climates at the end of the Clovis period. Following the fluted point period there is a dramatic increase in the number of Early Archaic point forms (Gardner 1989; Gingerich and Wagner 2017; Turner 1989). Cultural continuity between the Paleoindian and Early Archaic has long been debated in the Middle Atlantic region (Carr et al. 2013b), but arguments for continuity are based on similar land use patterns and a continued preference for select raw material sources (Gardner 1989).

## Key Sites

Cactus Hill, excavated by Joe and Lynn McAvoy (2015), is one of the leading candidates for a pre-Clovis occupation of eastern North America and is the only extensively excavated site with a plausible pre-Clovis component including incontrovertible artifacts and radiocarbon dates. Cactus Hill is not universally accepted (see Fiedel 2013), but it is remarkable for three reasons: (1) the pre-Clovis component is found underneath a well-established Clovis component containing both Clovis diagnostics and dates (unlike other pre-Clovis candidates); (2) radiocarbon dates are reported from features not charcoal scatters; and (3) the artifact assemblage contains both debitage and formal, classifiable tools (e.g., projectile points). Cactus Hill has produced some of the oldest radiocarbon dates in North America, which are directly associated with artifacts. The dates also have small standard deviations: 10,910 ± 40 ¹⁴C BP, Beta-210651 (Clovis); 15,070 ± 70 ¹⁴C BP, Beta-81590 (pre-Clovis); 16,940 ± 50 ¹⁴C BP, Beta-128330 (pre-Clovis) (McAvoy and McAvoy 2015). The earliest dates from Cactus Hill are equivalent in age to other pre-Clovis claims in the East (e.g., Adovasio et al. 1990; Halligan et al. 2016) and those throughout North America (Collins 2013; Davis et al. 2019; Waters et al. 2018).

Clovis in Virginia is best known from numerous fluted point finds and two landmark sites from which most ideas about regional Paleoindian archaeology have been constructed (Figure 11.1). Williamson, Dinwiddie County, is one of the largest Clovis sites in North America, stretching over 75 acres and yielding over 180 fluted points and thousands of tools and bifaces (McAvoy 2003). More than 20 artifact concentrations have been identified over the extent of the Williamson property (McAvoy and McAvoy 2015;Figure 11.2). Based on numerous investigations, the multiple clusters at Williamson seem to follow a similar pattern to the Flint Run Complex (Gardner 1974) with a quarry and quarry reduction area(s), base camp, and nearby hunting and processing sites (McAvoy and McAvoy 2015:559). Recent investigations have demonstrated that undisturbed deposits exist within the site.

Thunderbird, Warren County, is part of the Flint Run complex of sites that consists of quarries and lithic reduction workshops, quarry-related base camps, base camp maintenance stations, and isolated hunting loci (Carr et al. 2013b; Gardner 1974). These site categories have served as a Paleoindian site typology for the region. Thunderbird, a quarry-related base camp, and Fifty, a base camp maintenance station that contains multiple stratified Paleoindian and Early Archaic components, are the best-known sites within the Flint Run Complex (Carr et al. 2013b; Gardner 1974). Thunderbird, positioned directly across the Shenandoah River from jasper outcroppings, had roughly 600 m² excavated, with more than 100,000 artifacts mapped in situ (Carr et al. 2013b). The site contains remnants of a possible Paleoindian house and numerous activity areas representing both lithic reduction and domestic activities (Carr et al. 2013a). Its assemblage demonstrates evidence of classic Clovis technology including straight based preforms, overshot flakes, points with single flutes and low basal concavities, and minor amounts of blade production. Carefully mapped artifact clusters and extensive refitting of these features suggest a great deal of spatial integrity within many Paleoindian levels (Carr et al. 2013b; Verrey 1986).

## NEW PALEOINDIAN RESEARCH

### Little Rocky Creek, Hanover County
McAvoy and McAvoy (2015) describe this quarry-related base camp as being similar to Thunderbird. Here a series of artifact clusters were found around a quarry-workshop location of weathering amber chalcedony (WAC). Roughly 200 bifaces, preforms, points, and point fragments have been recovered from this site along with a wide range of tools including end scrapers, side scrapers, drills, gravers, and wedges. The site size is unknown but most of the artifacts have been surface collected over a 2-acre area (McAvoy and McAvoy 2015:Figure 2.5).

Little Rocky Creek may fit within the Flint Run model of site types, but McAvoy and McAvoy (2015) suggest a unidirectional rather than cyclical movement of WAC from this quarry to the south where it occurs on the Williamson site and elsewhere (McAvoy and McAvoy 2015). Apparently, artifacts made of Williamson and other Fall Zone cherts from south of the James River do not occur at Little Rocky Creek, suggesting that Williamson and the Little Rocky Creek quarries were not a part of a complementary cyclical settlement system. McAvoy and McAvoy (2015) further speculate that this trend may represent an early Clovis population that shifted its settlement focus south to begin using Williamson and the other now well-known Clovis loci. McAvoy and McAvoy have also demonstrated the widespread distribution of WAC across Virginia during the Paleoindian period.

### Smith Mountain
Smith Mountain represents a complex of sites that contain Early Paleoindian through Early Archaic deposits. At least six sites (44PY7, 44PY152, 44PY44, 44PY313, 44PY405, and 44PY98) have produced Clovis, untyped lanceolates, and Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic projectile points. One of the most complete sequences comes from 44PY152, where untyped early lanceolates and at least eight Clovis points occur with Dalton, Hardaway Side-Notched, Plano, Palmer, and Kirk Points (Figure 11.3).

More than 20 unfluted triangular lanceolate points have been found at Smith Mountain. Some have been embedded on eroding living floors, though dating of these surfaces has not yet been completed. The position of some lanceolates suggests they are earlier or coeval with Clovis. In one case, a point was found in close association with a cluster of formal flake tools and a fluted point, all made from mylonite.

Smith Mountain also contains an impressive diversity of raw materials including WAC, jasper, mylonite, North Carolina rhyolite, metavolcanics, crystal quartz, quartz, and quartzite. Some materials represent straight-line distances exceeding 320 km from confirmed sources, indicating long-distance movement and potentially multidirectional settlement patterns.

## FLUTED POINT DISTRIBUTIONS AND ANALYSES

### Point Counts and Distribution
Recent research has documented higher point densities in several Virginia counties. The highest concentration of points is in the central to southeastern part of Virginia. McAvoy's discovery of the Little Rocky Creek site reveals another large quarry site, which significantly increases the known point count for that county.

The Coastal Plain (0.046 km²) has the greatest density of fluted points, followed by the Piedmont (0.022 km²), and Mountain (0.007 km²). When examined by drainage basin, the Chowan-Albemarle (0.080 km²) and Roanoke (0.044 km²) show the highest densities. During the Late Pleistocene when sea levels were lower, the Roanoke and Chowan-Albemarle were part of the same basin, potentially explaining the concentrated usage of this area.

Raw material analysis shows that cryptocrystalline and metavolcanics make up about 70% of all points, with quartz and quartzite accounting for the remaining 30%. McAvoy (1992) documented the use of quartzite cobbles by Paleoindian knappers at sites in Sussex County. High-quality lithic sources like Williamson chert dominated material use within about 65 km of quarry base camps, supporting Gardner's (1989) theories about curation practices focused on select lithic sources.

### Point Metrics Analysis
To examine changes in points over time, the researchers analyzed five major attributes: length, thickness, length:width, thickness:length, and width:thickness ratios across Clovis, post-Clovis, and Early Archaic groups. 

Analysis of length:width ratios revealed resharpening patterns, with low values indicating more heavily resharpened points. Thickness:length is particularly important for assessing durability. Cheshier and Kelly (2006) demonstrated experimentally that higher thickness:length ratios (>0.121) significantly increase point durability.

Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed significant differences in Early Paleoindian fluted point metrics across Virginia's three major physiographic provinces. These differences were primarily between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, with generally smaller points found on the Coastal Plain. During the post-Clovis period, these provincial differences disappeared.

When comparing Early Paleoindian and post-Clovis groups, several metrics show changes between time periods. Fluted projectiles in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain show significantly more resharpening during the post-Clovis period compared to the Clovis period. On the Coastal Plain, post-Clovis points tend to be thinner and show evidence of increased resharpening.

The coefficient of variation (CV) values for post-Clovis point metrics are much higher than for Clovis, suggesting greater variation in resharpening and potentially indicating changes in mobility, resource exploitation patterns, tool replenishment strategies, or use of a greater variety of raw materials.

### Changes in Resharpening Patterns
Resharpening patterns continue into the Early Archaic period. Comparing Early Archaic samples from Smith Mountain to fluted points within the Piedmont shows a gradual decrease in length over time (t = 12.11, df = 333, p < 0.001). Thickness:length ratios also increase significantly (t = -14.10, df = 304, p < 0.001), indicating greater durability.

The researchers suggest this evolution in point form design represents a deliberate technological change for raw material conservation, adaptation to different hunting strategies, or changes in stone source usage. This technological shift occurred during a period of population growth in Virginia, potentially resulting in smaller territories and reduced access to preferred toolstone sources.

## PALEOINDIAN SETTLEMENT MODELS

### Continental Models
From a continental perspective, Clovis or Early Paleoindian groups in sparsely occupied landscapes are thought to have maintained high mobility patterns characterized by short-term occupations with frequent range shifts. Later adaptations to this model show groups spending more time at single localities and using more frequent logistical mobility before longer territorial shifts.

Using the PIDBA database, Anderson (1990a, 1996) argues that high fluted-point densities along major rivers in the Southeast indicate staging areas where mobility slowed as populations reached resource-rich river valleys. From these staging areas, populations gradually explored and moved into new territories.

### Virginia Settlement Models
Gardner's excavations at the Flint Run complex formed the basis for many Paleoindian settlement pattern models. His cyclical pattern involves repeated movements to and between satellite sites linked to large quarries and quarry base camps. This model effectively explains both the smaller territories apparent in the South and the orientation toward high-quality stone sources characteristic of Paleoindian assemblages.

Custer and colleagues (1983) proposed an alternative model more common during both Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods: macroband base camps and microband hunting camps used by groups who repeatedly occupied the same general areas for thousands of years. This model posits that base camps were positioned to access both upland and lowland environments.

The research presented in this chapter demonstrates that changing technological strategies coincided with population growth and potential shifts in territory size. The evidence supports a cultural transition from Paleoindian to Early Archaic periods characterized by adaptation to changing environmental conditions and social circumstances through technological innovation.

## SMITH MOUNTAIN AND TERRITORIAL PATTERNS

Smith Mountain's diversity of exotic lithic materials makes it unique among Virginia Paleoindian sites. Calculating potential catchment areas based on the diverse lithic resources found at Smith Mountain suggests an extensive territory. If researchers include sources from Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as WAC, the territory would be approximately 140,000 km². Even focusing only on Virginia and North Carolina sources, the territory would still be roughly 92,000 km².

These estimates assume direct procurement of stone, though trading networks were likely also important. The clustering of tools made from Paoli chert (from Kentucky, 340 km away) suggests individual tool kits that may have been carried with the group. Similar distances to Williamson (175 km), Morrow Mountain (185 km), and other metavolcanic sources (150 km) align with distances documented in other Paleoindian settlement systems across the Northeast.

The density of Paleoindian finds relative to known raw material sources (Figure 11.1) strongly indicates that lithic sources influenced settlement patterns. While many sites show a focus on a few common sources, Smith Mountain is exceptional in its use of multiple high-quality sources from considerable distances. This suggests it was part of a regularly traveled landscape, with exploitation of diverse raw material sources potentially following a serial settlement pattern.

Raw material analysis at Smith Mountain reveals that within any single excavated level, five to six different materials are represented, including rhyolite, jasper, mylonite, metavolcanics, quartz, and various cherts. Local materials (quartz, mylonite, some black chert) make up only a small percentage of the assemblage. Geochemical sourcing indicates at least 10% of jasper comes from Flint Run (230 km away), while other materials originate from southeastern Virginia, southwestern Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

Occupation at Smith Mountain is characterized by curated and exhausted tools, moderate reduction activities, and evidence of resharpening. Local raw materials account for 70-80% of the deposits, but these come from various small quartz and mylonite outcroppings throughout the valley rather than a single large quarry source. This pattern better represents a serial settlement system rather than the cyclical system proposed by Gardner.

## MOBILITY PATTERNS AND TEMPORAL CHANGES

McAvoy and McAvoy (2015) estimate a territory of approximately 80-120 km for Clovis people, based on data from southeastern Virginia. For post-Clovis groups, they suggest larger territories of 240 km or more, based on sites showing higher frequencies of non-local metavolcanics, cherts, and jasper. During the subsequent Hardaway side-notched phase, a similar expanded territory is proposed.

During the Early Archaic, territories appear to decrease in size, with corner-notched groups having ranges similar to Clovis (approximately 80-120 km). McAvoy suggests a more serial pattern of movement during this period compared to the cyclical pattern proposed for Clovis. These changes included a reduced focus on single raw material sources and more base camps associated with forested and water-related environments.

Analysis of fluted point metrics over time supports these proposed mobility changes. Clovis groups show the least point resharpening, consistent with smaller territories and more reliable access to replacement tools. Post-Clovis groups display greater resharpening, potentially indicating:

1. A risk minimization strategy favoring frequent point replacement to ensure optimal function
2. Changes in mobility related to pursuit of lower-density large game with higher failure risks
3. The extinction of megafauna shortly after the Clovis period

The increased tool replacement strategy would be facilitated by frequent movement to quarry locations. If territory sizes expanded during post-Clovis times (as McAvoy suggests), the need to conserve raw materials aligns with the observed changes in point metrics indicating more resharpening.

## CONCLUSION

Although fluted point distributional patterns in Virginia have not changed significantly since the mid-1990s, newer research at sites like Smith Mountain provides important insights into Paleoindian settlement systems. The sites documented by the Nottoway River Survey and at Smith Mountain offer an inventory of occupations that show frequent use but little connection to large quarries typical of cyclical settlement models.

Anderson and Sassaman (1996) noted that Gardner's Flint Run model likely applied well to areas where cryptocrystalline sources were geographically restricted, but questioned its relevance in areas with more homogeneous or moderately spaced stone sources. In Virginia, Gardner's model appears well-suited for Little Rocky Creek and Flint Run, but less applicable to Smith Mountain where diverse lithic sources are common.

The research demonstrates the growing complexity of understanding Paleoindian sites within Virginia. Movements between quarries remain a hallmark of the Paleoindian period, but the recognition of different resharpening patterns helps explain relationships between resources, mobility, and territory size.

Future research should focus on how sites like Smith Mountain fit into existing settlement models or suggest new, previously unrecognized patterns. The complex interplay between raw material sources, point technology, and settlement strategies continues to reveal a more nuanced picture of Virginia's earliest inhabitants.

## FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS AND ANALYSIS

### Figure 11.1: Fluted Point Density in Virginia
The figure shows a detailed map of Virginia with varying shades of gray indicating different densities of fluted point distributions across the state. The map uses a five-level scale ranging from 0.000-0.016 (lightest) to 0.216-0.420 (darkest) to show the concentrations of these artifacts. Key archaeological sites are marked with symbols, including quarries (hexagons with crosses), quarry base camps (hexagons), and lithic sources (triangles). A prominent dark band runs diagonally across the state, marking the highest concentration areas.

This map is critical to understanding the spatial distribution of Paleoindian presence in Virginia. The density patterns reveal potential migration routes, settlement preferences, and the relationship between resource availability and human occupation. The highest densities appear to correlate with major river systems and lithic resource areas, supporting the chapter's discussion of how raw material availability influenced Paleoindian settlement patterns.

### Figure 11.2: Unfluted Lanceolates
This photographic plate displays eleven unfluted lanceolate projectile points (labeled a-k) made from various raw materials including mylonite, metarhyolite, weathering amber chalcedony, jasper, quartzite, aphyric rhyolite, porphyritic rhyolite, and metavolcanic stone. The diversity of materials is significant as it demonstrates the wide range of lithic resources utilized by Paleoindian populations in Virginia.

These unfluted lanceolates represent a technological tradition that either coexisted with or followed the fluted point traditions. The variety of raw materials indicates extensive knowledge of local resources and possibly trade networks or mobility patterns across different geological zones. This evidence supports the chapter's discussion of technological changes in Paleoindian traditions and the importance of raw material selection.

### Figure 11.3: Cultural Sequence for 44PY152
This figure presents a chronological display of projectile point forms recovered from site 44PY152 at Smith Mountain, arranged to show the typological evolution through time. The points are organized as follows:
- Early Archaic forms (a-e)
- Hardaway Side-Notched (f-i)
- Dalton Variants (j-n)
- Deeply indented fluted forms (o-p)
- Heavily resharpened Clovis/Early Paleoindian forms (q-t)

Two insets show:
- Inset u: Piano-like forms dated to approximately 10,150 ± 70 years BP
- Inset v: Unfluted lanceolates

This figure is particularly significant because it visually demonstrates the cultural continuity and technological transitions from the Paleoindian to Early Archaic periods at a single site. The stratified sequence provides empirical evidence for the chronological ordering of different point technologies and supports the chapter's discussion of cultural continuity between the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods. The presence of multiple point styles within a clear stratigraphic context makes 44PY152 an important reference site for understanding the cultural evolution in Virginia's prehistory.
