# Collective Burial in Late Prehistoric Virginia: Excavation and Analysis of the Rapidan Mound

## Gary H. Dunham, Debra L. Gold, and Jeffrey L. Hantman

Recent excavation and analysis of the remaining section of the endangered Rapidan Mound site (44OR1) in the central Virginia Piedmont provide new insights into a unique complex of burial mounds in the Virginia interior. Known since Thomas Jefferson's eighteenth-century description, the mounds are both earth and stone and accretional earthen mounds. Thirteen are recorded, all dating to the late prehistoric and early contact era (ca. A.D. 900-1700). Typically containing few artifacts, the accretional mounds are unusual in North America in the numbers of individuals interred, more than one thousand in at least two cases, and in the nature of the secondary, collective burial ritual that built up the mounds over centuries. Following a review of the characteristics of the mound complex, we focus on the Rapidan Mound and the analysis of the collective, secondary burial features in the mound. Precise provenience information and bioarchaeological analyses of two large and intact collective burial features provide new information on health and diet, and several lines of evidence for demographic reconstruction. Finally, we discuss the mortuary ritual conducted at the mounds within the cultural and historical context of the region.

## Introduction

As students of American archaeology know well, the first published account of an archaeological excavation in North America was that authored by Thomas Jefferson in his book *Notes on the State of Virginia* (Jefferson 1982 [1787]). In a chapter on Virginia's Indians, Jefferson included a discussion of the methods and results of his problem-oriented and stratigraphic excavation of a burial mound near his home in the Virginia Piedmont. This publication stimulated correspondence concerning archaeological sites and Indian history to and from Jefferson until his death in 1826. As president of the American Philosophical Society, Jefferson urged his compatriots to collect information about Indian mounds throughout the expanding nation. There is then a surprising temporal continuity between Jefferson's writing and the subsequent mound-focused research of Atwater (1820), Squier and Davis (1848), and Thomas (1894).

A striking link among these studies is the shared interest in a regional perspective and the documentation of *variation* in earthworks across the landscape. Today, it is axiomatic that the study of variability in mounds and mortuary practices is a core element of studies of prehistoric social and political organization and demography in much of the Eastern Woodlands. It is ironic that the Virginia mound and mound group about which Jefferson wrote have been absent from most of this two-centuries-long discussion. Jefferson made clear in *Notes* that the mound he tested was part of a regional complex of mounds in interior Virginia. He made specific mention of two other mounds in Virginia and noted "many are to be found all over this country... of different sizes, some of them constructed of earth, and some of loose stones" (Jefferson 1982:97, 100 [1787]). He also noted, perceptively, that the mounds were "much reduced in height, and spread in width, by the plough, and will probably disappear in time" (Jefferson 1982:100 [1787]).

The mounds of Virginia have today all but disappeared from the visual landscape. However, excavations by Jefferson, nineteenth-century antiquarians, the Smithsonian, the Archeological Society of Virginia, and most recently, the University of Virginia, provide a basis for synthesis and study. Today, this mound group (Figure 1; Table 1) can be described as consisting of 13 mounds dating to the late prehistoric period (Late Woodland in Virginia, A.D. 900-1650), clearly bounded within a large area of central and west-central Virginia, and comprised entirely of accretional burial mounds (Dunham 1994; Gold 1999; MacCord 1986).

This mound complex is of significance for a number of reasons. First, the mounds are located at a compelling, albeit challenging, geographic nexus—that area of the Eastern Woodlands immediately beyond the northeastern extent of Mississippian mound distributions and just west of the coastal distribution of late prehistoric Woodland ossuaries (Boyd and Boyd 1992; Curry 1999; Loftfield 1990; Smith 1978). At a broad level of abstraction, the Virginia mounds represent a distinctive complex at the intersection of prehistoric interaction spheres, sociopolitical formations, and mortuary practices.

The late prehistoric period witnessed considerable cultural change throughout the Eastern United States, and the Piedmont and Ridge and Valley regions of central Virginia were no exception (Egloff and Woodward 1992; Gardner 1986). Three major aspects of this culture change in interior Virginia can be summarized briefly: (1) sedentism increased and settlement location became focused on the fertile floodplains along rivers (Gallivan 1999; Hantman and Klein 1992); (2) agriculture emerged as an increasingly important new element in the subsistence economy (Gallivan 1999; Trimble 1996); and, (3) social relations became increasingly heterogeneous and unequal (Gallivan 1999; Gold 1999). The evidence for the first two is clear in the archaeological record, while the latter is inferred from a cautious reading of the earliest ethnohistoric records (Hantman 1990) and the archaeological study of residential and mortuary sites (Dunham 1999; Gallivan 1999; Gold 1999). Gallivan's detailed study of households and communities throughout the late prehistoric James River drainage documents an interesting pattern in the adoption of these changes. He shows that although domesticates appear by A.D. 900 or slightly before, it is some centuries later, ca. A.D. 1200, that the correlates of sedentism, agriculture, surplus storage, and social inequality can be seen across the region (Gallivan 1999). This pattern describes the late Late Woodland period in Virginia, ca. A.D. 1200-1600.

By 1607, two closely allied polities were described by Jamestown colonist John Smith for the Virginia interior—the Monacans centered on the James and Rivanna Rivers and the Mannahoacs located along the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers. Hantman (1990) and Mouer (1983) have suggested that it is most parsimonious to describe both areas under the rubric of Monacan, noting that variations in personal and tribal identity existed at different spatial scales within the region and over time. At the time of contact and for some time before, the sociopolitical organization of the Monacans can be described as a chiefdom, inferred from ethnohistoric reference to inequality, including "king's houses" and tributary relations (Hantman 1993). Throughout the Late Woodland and early contact era, the Monacans were involved in an important and fluctuating "trading and raiding" (Ford 1972) relationship with the Powhatan chiefdom of the Virginia Coastal Plain, their immediate neighbors to the east (Gleach 1997; Hantman 1990, 1993; Rountree 1989, 1993; Rountree and Turner 1994).

Accompanying the cultural changes that began with the Late Woodland period in interior Virginia was a dynamic series of transformations in mortuary practices, culminating in the development of collective accretional mound burial over a wide area of the region. The next section describes these mounds.

## Virginia Burial Mounds

Accretional mounds built along the floodplains and adjacent terraces of major rivers and tributaries stood at 13 known locations across the Piedmont and Ridge and Valley regions of central Virginia (Figure 1; Table 1). They ranged in height from ca. 1 to 5 m, were composed of earth or a combination of earth and stone, and contained numerous and often quite different burials within and sometimes under them (Boyd and Boyd 1992; Dunham 1994; Gardner 1986). The mounds were constructed through accretion with discrete mortuary activity taking place regularly over a period of several hundred years (Gardner 1986; Gold 1999; MacCord 1986). Radiocarbon dates place the beginning of mound burial at ca. A.D. 900 (see Table 2), and all date to the Late Woodland period, with some noted earlier and later components. The most recent radiocarbon date is A.D. 1440(±110) (Holland et al. 1983), but in almost all cases the radiocarbon dates come from lower levels in the mounds. Holland (1978) and Dunham (1994) suggest that the easternmost (Piedmont) mounds were still being used in the first half of the seventeenth century. Jefferson made reference to a group of Indians visiting the mound on the Rivanna River in the 1750s (Jefferson 1982:100 [1787]), and similar accounts have been described for some of the other mounds (Dunham 1994).

The contents, chronology, and significance of the burial mounds attracted interest among Virginia archaeologists and the Smithsonian's Gerard Fowke and David Bushnell. During the past two centuries a number of limited site reports have been issued on the burial mounds of the region (Boyer 1983; Bushnell 1914; Carpenter 1950; Davenport 1952; Fowke 1894; Holland 1960, 1963; Howe 1845; MacCord 1965, 1986, 1988; MacCord and Valliere 1965; Martin 1835; Montanus 1850; Valentine 1903). One early attempt at synthesis and interpretation of the mounds as a group was offered by Schmitt (1952). Influenced by the logic and terminology of the McKern taxonomic system, Schmitt suggested that variation in burial goods and ceramics between some of the mounds required considering them as part of two different "foci" which he attributed to the Middle Woodland—the "Mountain Focus" and the "Clover Creek Focus." Subsequent work has shown that there are substantial differences between the mounds but it is better to see them as a related group of sites specific to the Late Woodland and contact eras (Dunham 1994, 1999; Hantman 1990, 1993).

In this paper we describe the results of our collaborative study of one of the mounds in the Virginia mound complex, the Rapidan Mound (44OR1). The Rapidan Mound is located on the Rapidan River, a tributary of the Rappahannock River, just 14 miles north of the mound described by Jefferson. As we and others have elsewhere discussed the mound complex as a group (see especially Boyd and Boyd 1992; Dunham 1994, 1999; Gold 1999; Hantman 1990, 1993; MacCord 1986; Schmitt 1952), we will here briefly review those syntheses and then focus on insights drawn from the University of Virginia's recent systematic excavation of that portion of the Rapidan Mound still extant in the late twentieth century (Dunham 1990). None of the other Virginia mounds was excavated with modern standards of provenience and context. Only five have curated osteological collections that allow bioarchaeological study (Gold 1999), and only the Rapidan Mound permits such study in provenience. Ongoing destruction of the Rapidan Mound caused by the shifting course of the river forced the opportunity to conduct new excavations as a means of preservation.

We first provide an overview of the cultural context in which the mounds were built, followed by a brief description of the regional mound group. We then describe the stratigraphy and features recently excavated at the Rapidan Mound site. The demography, diet, and health profiles of its extant burial population are discussed, and a tentative reconstruction of its mortuary ritual sequence is offered. In the concluding section, we explore briefly how the findings from the Rapidan site shed light on the prehistoric people who created the mounds, and on parallels to other collective burials in the Eastern United States.

## Late Prehistoric and Contact Era Interior Virginia: A Regional Context

The late prehistoric period witnessed considerable cultural change throughout the Eastern United States, and the Piedmont and Ridge and Valley regions of central Virginia were no exception (Egloff and Woodward 1992; Gardner 1986). Three major aspects of this culture change in interior Virginia can be summarized briefly: (1) sedentism increased and settlement location became focused on the fertile floodplains along rivers (Gallivan 1999; Hantman and Klein 1992); (2) agriculture emerged as an increasingly important new element in the subsistence economy (Gallivan 1999; Trimble 1996); and, (3) social relations became increasingly heterogeneous and unequal (Gallivan 1999; Gold 1999). The evidence for the first two is clear in the archaeological record, while the latter is inferred from a cautious reading of the earliest ethnohistoric records (Hantman 1990) and the archaeological study of residential and mortuary sites (Dunham 1999; Gallivan 1999; Gold 1999).

## The Rapidan Mound

The Rapidan Mound is situated on a broad floodplain of the Rapidan River, flanked by terraces and hills. A terrace 150 m southwest of the site is believed to be the location of Stegara, identified on John Smith's map of Virginia and identified with a "king's house" symbol (distinguished from an "ordinary house") (Barbour 1986:176; Bushnell 1935). The mound has been a well-known landmark in local history, having been repeatedly visited, dug into, and written about since the early nineteenth century (Bushnell 1935; Fowke 1894; Holland et al. 1983; Martin 1835; Meade 1857; Smithsonian Institution 1910; Thomas 1891). It was affected by a common array of post-depositional natural and cultural forces—periodic flooding and scouring by the river, looting, controlled excavation, plowing, and the mining of the rich mound soil to replenish deflated terrace fields—all of which altered the mound's dimensions over time.

The original dimensions of the mound can be estimated from several lines of evidence: the earliest known description of the mound (Martin 1835), information supplied by local informants in the nineteenth century (Fowke 1894), and the size of the burial area described by several excavations (Dunham 1990; Fowke 1894; Holland et al. 1983). These data suggest that the mound had at its "peak" reached a height of between four and five meters and measured some 13 m across at its base. By the end of the nineteenth century, its eastern half had been carried off by the river, a 6.5-m-wide area had been quarried from the center, and the elevation had been reduced to 2 m (Fowke 1894). Subsequent deposition from floods and the growth of a large oak tree provided a protective cap for the southwestern portion of the mound that remained intact until the late twentieth century. Figure 2 provides a conjectural sequence of change for the Rapidan Mound from the time of its use to the present.

## Previous Study at the Rapidan Mound

The first published mention of the Rapidan Mound did not involve excavation. It is described in Joseph Martin's 1835 *Gazetteer of Virginia*. Martin's survey provides us with the earliest recorded dimensions of the mound. More importantly, he wrote that the mound contained "tiers of bodies" spaced two feet apart and stacked "one above another with their heads pointed north." Martin's description of "bodies" with individual orientation suggests that the uppermost level of the mound may have contained primary, individual burials (presumably dating to the historic era). Although our focus here is on the collective burial ritual of the portion of the mound studied by archaeologists, we see Martin's (1835) description as being suggestive of postcontact change in burial practice from collective to individual.

In archaeological literature, the Rapidan Mound first appears in Cyrus Thomas's exhaustive *Catalogue of Prehistoric Works East of the Rocky Mountains* (1891), having been brought to the attention of the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution a few years earlier. Shortly afterward, a 9.5-x-13-m segment of the mound was excavated by the Smithsonian's Gerard Fowke as part of his larger study of the archaeology of Virginia. A brief report on the excavation appeared in *American Anthropologist* in 1893, and was also included in his 1894 monograph *Archaeological Investigations in the James and Potomac Valleys*. Fowke reported finding few artifacts but many burials, the latter consisting of two types: pit burials and the collective burial features he termed "bone beds." Fowke discovered 18 of these collective burial features. He described only one in any detail, but did note that the others varied in size and were deposited in layers (complementing Jefferson's description of the stratigraphy of layers of bone in the Rivanna River mound). Beneath the mound was a concentration of "graves or burial pits" that had been dug into the floodplain. These pits varied in size, with the larger ones containing multiple layers of bones. Fowke did not discuss these burials individually, presumably because the pits and their contents were difficult to distinguish. Most were crowded together, overlapping, and contained poorly preserved bones. He did postulate that some of the "graves" appeared to contain primary burials (Fowke 1894).

One other limited archaeological study of the Rapidan Mound took place in 1979. The Archeological Society of Virginia, under the direction of C.G. Holland, excavated two 2-x-2-m units in the western half of the mound site to a depth of approximately one meter each (Holland et al. 1983:7). One of these was placed in the backfilled area of Fowke's trench, while the other was placed beyond the western edge of the mound. The 2-m² unit that is believed to have been placed in Fowke's backfill contained over 3,500 bones and bone fragments, representing a minimum of 44 individuals (Gold 1994). Fowke made no mention of any collection of bones from his excavation and there are no skeletal remains from the Rapidan Mound accessioned in the Smithsonian Institution collections.

## University of Virginia Excavations

The University of Virginia conducted three summer seasons of fieldwork between 1988 and 1990 to examine the surviving mound, document its features, and remove human remains for analysis and eventual reburial (Dunham 1989, 1990). Support and funding for the excavation were provided by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources (VDHR) and the Dean's Research Fund of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia. The excavation was conducted under a court order issued for the scientific excavation and study of the human remains and requiring the reinterment of those remains with the Monacan Tribe of Virginia, which took place in October 1998. A sample of human remains was retained according to the guidelines established by Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994) and approved by the Monacan Tribal Council and the VDHR. Complete reports of the excavation and osteological study can be found in Dunham (1990) and Gold (1994). Hantman served as the Principal Investigator for the project; Dunham was the project director overseeing all aspects of the site excavation and interpretation of the mound stratigraphy and features; Gold conducted the bioarchaeological analyses of the human remains. The objectives guiding the field procedures were (1) to evaluate the integrity of the mound and its features; (2) to identify spatial and temporal variation in mound and submound burial practices; and (3) to locate the mound perimeter and any associated encircling features.

Before excavation began, the riverbank section of the Rapidan River that had at one time been the mound interior was cleaned and profiled (Figure 3). This profile revealed the presence of at least two extant and apparently overlapping mound strata as well as the location of Fowke's backfilled trench. Once the general stratigraphy of the site had been determined, excavation proceeded across the site in 2-x-2-m units, excavating by arbitrary levels within each stratum. An area totaling 106.5 m² was opened, exposing the remaining southern portion of the mound and its southeastern perimeter (Figure 4). All features and cultural and natural intrusions were point plotted. Each bone or bone fragment from burial features was numbered, mapped, and removed individually. Sectional profiles were made of all balks that, in combination with the riverbank profile, enabled a series of composite east-west and north-south profiles to be assembled that covered the entire site.

Four major strata were identified. Detailed, unit-by-unit, stratigraphic analysis and profiles are in Dunham (1990). The four strata (some containing separate levels) can be described as follows:
(1) a light brown to brown alluvial and humic flood-deposited overburden occurring in two levels of ca. 30 cm and 40 cm respectively. These represent flood deposits that buried the site in the late nineteenth and late twentieth centuries;
(2) an undisturbed, older light to dark brown humic layer containing small nonburial stone features and some postcontact artifacts (several iron nail fragments). This stratum was concentrated along the eastern half of the site and sloped upward toward the center of the original mound, thus suggesting a relationship to the mound and the possible use of the mound after European contact;
(3) a gray-black, sandy loam, occurring in two locations and buried between 55 and 80 cm below surface. We identified these as mound strata and labeled them Mound Stratum 1 and Mound Stratum 2. It is in these two contexts that the "bone bed" features were located. Mound Stratum 1 averaged 25 cm in thickness, reaching 30 cm at its thickest point and 5 cm at its thinnest. In the riverbank profile, Mound Stratum 1 extended for approximately 10 m; it reached at least 6 m south to the southern edge of the excavation. The stratum was defined by color and charcoal flecking, and also contained a light scatter of artifacts. Horizontally, this stratum extended from the riverbank to the southern edge of the site (ca. 6 m). Mound Stratum 2 is a thick, homogenous black-stained sandy loam, somewhat more compact than Mound Stratum 1 and separated from Mound Stratum 1 by a yellow clay soil. In profile, this level appears to rest in a shallow basin carved out of the yellow, sandy clay subsoil. Mound Stratum 2 contained a light density of artifacts but heavy charcoal flecking and some calcined bone fragments. The maximum thickness of this stratum is 60 cm; the minimum is 25 cm. The largest and most intact collective bone features were in this stratum;
(4) yellow, sandy clay subsoil. This submound stratum contained several pit burial features as well as a surface on which several stone features were located.

## Burial Features

The burial features we identified were of two types: collective bone burials ("bone beds" to Fowke) and submound pit burials. Portions of three submound burial pits (features 6, 7, and 8) were found below the mound surface in subsoil. Of these three, only features 6 and 7 had sufficient bone preservation to allow analysis. Four collective burial features were discovered, two resting on and within largely undisturbed Mound Stratum 2 (features 9 and 10), with the impacted remnant of one other (feature 4) situated 20 cm higher in the same stratum. Feature 4 had originally extended much further northward but had been mostly swept away by the river. Feature 2 is a wide but thin bone scatter located directly above Mound Stratum 2. The low density of bone and the absence of any large bone fragments suggest this feature has been disturbed or may not represent a cultural feature. The largest of the intact collective bone deposits, feature 10, measured about four meters across, nearly twice the width of the other, feature 9 (see Figure 5). Both were composed entirely of bones and were not associated with soil distinctions, markers, or intentionally placed objects. Dunham (1990) and Gold (1999) provide detail on each of these features.

Nonburial features were also noted at the site, located along and beyond the southeastern edge of the mound. These include a probable hearth, eight postholes that may form a structure, and 19 clusters and lines of small cobbles and broken rocks, many evenly spaced in rows. Three of the stone features contained iron nail fragments. Interpretation of these features is difficult, but they are cultural and indicate minimally that ritual activity took place on the mound apart from the burial features and that use of the mound occurred during the contact era.

## Bioarchaeology of the Rapidan Mound

More than 9,000 identifiable bones were recovered and analyzed from these burial features. Several hundred additional bones were recorded and collected, but were too fragmentary for accurate identification. A small number of bones was recovered from outside the mound but these are thought to result from postdepositional burrowing disturbance at the site. With the exception of a few hands, feet, and vertebrae, the bones were disarticulated and thoroughly mingled. Approximately two percent of the bones bear postmortem marks. Burnt and calcined bones do occur at the site but they are very rare (Gold 1999, 2000).

## Mound Population

A central question concerns the number of individuals whose bones were eventually placed in burial features and the mound as a whole. Only mound features 9 and 10 were complete and allow for the meaningful construction of the minimum number of individuals (MNI). Osteological analysis indicates a minimum of 32 individuals in feature 9 and a minimum of 28 individuals in feature 10 (Gold 1994, 1999).

Reconstruction of the maximum number of individuals interred in the mound is far more problematic, given the extrapolation needed from the sample to the mound as a whole. Fowke (1894) reported finding eighteen collective burial features during his excavation. Although the collective burials uncovered by Fowke were similar in appearance to those excavated in the University of Virginia excavations, they varied considerably in size from slight traces of bones to the commingled remains of (by his estimate) 15 to 20 individuals. Fowke concluded that "it is impossible to accurately estimate the number of skeletons found in this mound, but there were certainly not fewer than 200, and there may possibly have been 250" (1894:36). Two hundred to 250 individuals distributed among 18 features yields an average of approximately 11-14 individuals per features, less than half the minimum number of individuals (28 and 32) recovered from each of the two complete collective burial features analyzed by Gold (1994) and described above.

The discrepancy between these sets of figures may be in part a consequence of Fowke's vertically oriented trenching methodology, which would have made it difficult for him to inspect collective burials in situ without damaging them. Another factor is that estimates of burial populations in the late nineteenth century were usually based on complete and near-complete skulls. Given our understanding of the fragmented, jumbled nature of the skeletal remains at the Rapidan Mound, this practice could have resulted in Fowke underestimating the number of individuals composing each burial feature. Differences in sampling may also help account for the discrepancy in collective burial population estimates. Fowke excavated a considerably larger area of the mound and uncovered many more collective burials than were uncovered by the University of Virginia study. It would not be entirely unexpected, then, for the 18 collective burials recovered by Fowke to evince greater variation in population than the smaller sample recovered a century later.

Our own estimates of the number of individuals contributing to the mound differ from Fowke's. Dunham (1994) and Gold (1999), using different sets of assumptions, derived two different estimates of total mound population. We present both interpretations here as reflecting both a minimum and a maximum estimate. Dunham (1994) emphasized the variation in size among the collective burial features reported by Fowke and the possibility of changing mound use over time, resulting in single, primary interments in the uppermost section of the mound (see Martin 1835). He argued that Fowke's estimate of 15-20 individuals for the larger collective burial features can be used as an average population estimate of all the collective burial features uncovered during his excavation, reasoning that the risk of Fowke's underestimating the population of larger, well-preserved features would be offset by the smaller reported size and deteriorated condition of others. Applying this average range to the number of recorded collective burials yields a population of between 270 and 360 individuals uncovered by Fowke from his trench. By comparing the estimated volume of the mound excavated by Fowke with the total amount assumed to have been originally used for collective burial, Dunham projected that approximately 1,000 people were interred in commingled bone deposits at the Rapidan Mound. Dunham also calculated that some 15 individuals were interred in primary burials in the uppermost section of the mound and that about 168 people had earlier been buried in pits under it.

Alternatively, Gold (1999, 2000) suggests that although Fowke provided an accurate count of the number of features he encountered, his counts of the number of individuals per feature were too low, and that the features uncovered by Fowke were likely similar in size as well as composition to the burial features excavated by University of Virginia.

## Figure 4. University of Virginia excavation areas (grid system south of 1988 riverbank) with hypothesized location and extent of prior excavations. Bold lines indicate edges of mound strata 1 and 2.

This figure shows an archaeological site plan of the Rapidan Mound excavation. The drawing depicts a grid system oriented with north at the top, showing the riverbank edge (marked as 1988 Riverbank and 1979 Riverbank) and the excavation units as squares laid out in a grid pattern. The plan shows several key features including the "Hypothesized Location of Mound at Time of Fowke's Excavation," "Probable Location of Fowke's Trench," 1979 Excavation Units, and a Tree Stump. Bold lines on the plan indicate the edges of mound strata 1 and 2. The diagram illustrates how river erosion has progressively destroyed portions of the mound over time, with the 1988 riverbank showing the most recent edge. The archaeological grid extends southward from the riverbank, with excavation units arranged to capture the remaining portions of the mound. This site plan is crucial for understanding how Indigenous burial practices were preserved and documented despite significant natural and human disturbances to this important Monacan cultural site.

## Figure 5. Plan view of features identified by University of Virginia excavation. Number 1 refers to a small charcoal pit at beginning of Mound Stratum 1. Number 2 refers to edge of Mound Stratum 2. Numbers 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 refer to submound and mound burial features.

This figure shows a detailed plan view of the archaeological features at the Rapidan Mound. The diagram illustrates the spatial layout of the burial features, with numbers 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 marking the key burial deposits. Features 9 and 10 (in the northern portion) represent the large collective secondary burials containing the commingled remains of multiple individuals. Stone features are shown clustered along the eastern edge of the excavation, with the "Edge of Mound Stratum 1" clearly marked. The plan reveals the complex nature of Monacan mortuary practices, showing how Indigenous peoples in this region created organized mortuary features through the careful placement of human remains in specific patterns. The placement of these features, together with stone alignments, demonstrates the ritual significance of this location and the cultural importance of collective burial practices that physically gathered community members together after death in a shared sacred space.

mum number of individuals similar to that of the two
features excavated by the University of Virginia, that
is, approximately 30. Accepting that Fowke’s 18 fea-
tures comprised one-fourth (Dunham 1994; Fowke
1894) of the original mound volume, Gold estimates
a maximum presence of 2,160 individuals through-
out the period of mound use (a figure consistent with
Hantman’s [1990:684] earlier published estimate
based on the extrapolation from the 1979 excavation
data).

Conservatively stated, reflecting a minimum and
a maximum, there were between 1,000 and 2,000
individuals buried in the Rapidan Mound. Most inter-
estingly, either number represents the largest burial
population from a single site in Virginia, and a strik-
ingly large burial population for any single mortu-
ary site in the Eastern United States. While these
numbers seem unusually high, they reflect the use of
the individual mounds over several centuries. This
long-term continuity of use is as striking and signif-
icant in a comparative frame as is the extrapolated
and admittedly speculative estimate of total numbers
of individuals in the mounds.

Sex and Age Determination

Because of the fragmentary and jumbled nature of
bones at this site, information on age at death and
sex of individuals is very difficult to obtain. Ideally,
both age and sex determinations are made based on
the evaluation of a range of cranial and postcranial
indicators from any one individual. This is impossi-
ble for the Rapidan burial features, where (with the
exception of the few cases of articulated feet and ver-
tebrae) no two bones can confidently be attributed
to the same individual. It is clear, however, that adults
of all ages are represented in the Rapidan burial fea-
tures, as are juveniles and possibly also some infants.

Sex determination was attempted wherever pos-
sible using a variety of osteological techniques. The
pelvic region is generally considered the most accu-
rate indicator of sex (Bass 1995). In nine cases from
feature 9, tentative sex identification was possible
based on pelvic characteristics. Of these, six indi-
viduals were identified as female, one as male, one
as probably female, and one as probably male. Unfor-
tunately, no sex identification based on pelvic mor-
phology was possible for feature 10. Cranial metrics
and morphology were also examined for sex deter-
mination. One male, three probable males, and one

AMERICAN ANTIQUITY

[Vol. 68, No. 1, 2003]

probable female were identified in feature 9 and one
male was identified in feature 10. Because the skele-
tal remains are jumbled and fragmentary, there were
no cases in which a cranium could be associated as
an individual with any postcranial remains; thus sex
determination should be considered extremely ten-
tative. The most important information obtained from
this analysis is that both males and females were
interred in each burial feature, although the frequency
with which males and females are represented is not
clear.

Age determinations were also problematic given
the fragmentary nature of the bones. It is especially
difficult to determine age at death of juveniles
because the small and fragile bones were typically
fragmented beyond recognition and were always
missing the epiphyseal surfaces that enable age iden-
tification. Identification of juvenile age at death by
dental development is somewhat more informative,
but all jaws are fragmentary and most have few teeth
still in their sockets. Still, it is useful to know how
many of the individuals interred at Rapidan Mound
died before reaching skeletal maturity. Gold (1995)
calculated the number of subadults (younger than age
18-20) as represented by the dentition. Out of a min-
imum of 32 individuals in feature 9, three (9 percent)
were identified as subadults. Out of a minimum of
28 individuals in feature 10, seven (25 percent) were
identified as subadults. All of these were identified
as belonging to subadults over the age of five years.
The partially preserved burial features did not con-
tain a sufficient number of individual teeth for this
type of analysis. A very few fragments of infant-
sized bones were recovered in each of these burial
features but these are too fragmentary to identify age
with any confidence.

In his study of the late prehistoric ossuaries from
Nanjemoy Creek in the Potomac River valley of
Maryland, Ubelaker reported 46 to 52 percent of all
deaths occurring before the age of 20. As Ubelaker
noted (1974, 1989), the two ossuaries provided an
unusual opportunity for demographic reconstruction
for at least two reasons. First, available ethnohistoric
and archaeological evidence suggest they contain
the remains of all individuals who died within a
period of several years. Second, the previously undis-
turbed ossuaries were excavated and analyzed in
entirety, providing an excellent baseline against
which other late prehistoric demographic profiles in
the region may be compared.

REPORTS 121

When compared with the Nanjemoy ossuaries,
the Rapidan Mound demographic profile indicates
that juveniles in general, and infants and young chil-
dren especially, are underrepresented. Some of this
discrepancy is undoubtedly attributable to the frag-
mentary nature of the bones in the mound’s collec-
tive burial features. This does not explain, however,
the difference in the percentage of subadults between
the two complete collective burials. We suggest that
the underrepresentation of subadults in the Rapidan
Mound collective burials is attributable to cultural
causes, such as alternative postmortem treatment for
some young individuals, especially infants. A simi-
lar underrepresentation of infants and young children
was noted by Fowke at Rapidan, and by Jefferson at
Rivanna Mound. This does not occur, however, at the
other mounds known in Virginia’s Ridge and Valley
region. This difference permits the suggestion that
infants and young children are underrepresented in
the collective burials in Piedmont mounds but not in
other mound burials in interior Virginia. The pied-
mont mounds are also those that are believed to be
the latest of the complex.

Diet and Health

Osteological analysis of the skeletal remains from
the Rapidan Mound site provides new information
about late prehistoric patterns of diet and health in
the region, revealing a clearer picture of the impor-
tance of maize cultivation.

Trimble (1996) conducted carbon and nitrogen
isotope analysis on samples from the Rapidan Mound
as part of her larger study of changing prehistoric
diet in Virginia and North Carolina. Interpretation of
these figures alone suggest a diet including C, plants,
but one in which those plants probably constituted
between 25 percent and 50 percent of the diet (Trim-
ble 1996:85). This estimate is analogous to other
sites in the mound complex and most similar in range
to the Potomac Creek site ossuaries further east on
the Coastal Plain (see Hantman 2001:119; Trimble
1996:43).

The two intact burial features had caries fre-
quencies of 28.2 percent for feature 9 and 18.2 per-
cent for feature 10. These figures are high, even in
comparison with populations from other areas of the
United States that clearly relied quite heavily on cul-
tivated plant foods (Larsen 1987). The carious lesions
are most often found on the molars, a pattern that
may also reflect the consumption of large amounts

of starchy foods. Although the frequency of dental
caries at Rapidan Mound is high, the majority of
these lesions are actually very small. While the caries
rate strongly suggests a diet high in carbohydrates,
it appears that this diet was sufficiently supplemented
with protein and other nutrients to avoid serious
health problems for most of the individuals interred
at the mound.

Periostitis

Periosteal lesions are by far the most common post-
cranial marker of disease in the Rapidan Mound pop-
ulation. Periostitis is a bony response to trauma or
infection (White 2000). It usually reflects a chronic,
non-life-threatening infection rather than a life-end-
ing illness. Periosteal lesions occur most frequently
on the long bone shafts, especially the tibia and fibula
(Larsen 1997). They also occur infrequently on other
bones.

In both complete collective burials from the Rap-
idan Mound, the tibial shafts showed the highest rate
of periostitis. Approximately 20 percent of the tibia
shaft fragments show evidence of healed or active
periosteal lesions. The majority of the periosteal
lesions are mild, the result of chronic, but non-life-
threatening disease. The frequency of periostial
lesions is consistent with late prehistoric populations
in the Eastern Woodlands (Gold 1999:276). It is
lower than several reported Mississippian popula-
tions such as Averbach (Eisenberg 1991), Moundville
(Powell 1991), and Dickson Mounds (Goodman et
al. 1984) for which investigators report periostial
frequencies of 50-80 percent of all individuals. It is
worth noting that the frequency of tibial periostitis
in the Rapidan Mound population is lower than that
in the other late prehistoric Virginia mounds (Gold
1999, 2000).

Osteoarthritis

The only other health problem evident in the skele-
tal remains of the Rapidan Mound population was
mild osteoarthritis of the vertebrae. Osteoarthritis
was evident in 16.9 percent of the vertebrae from fea-
ture 9 and 8.8 percent of the vertebrae from feature
10 (Gold 1994).

Trauma

There was no evidence of pre-mortem or perimortem
skeletal trauma in any of the burial features excavated
by the University of Virginia. The skeletal remains

removed from units excavated in 1979 located in the
backfill of Fowke’s trench, however, showed a dif-
ferent pattern. Of the 73 identifiable cranial vault
bones recovered from the remnant of Fowke’s trench,
three fragments contained circular, depressed, healed
traumas indicative of injury with a blunt instrument.
Two of these injuries are located on fragments of the
superior portion of parietal bones, while the third is
located on the midline of a fragmentary frontal bone.

The presence of blunt-force trauma certainly indi-
cates active hostility during one or more periods of
mound use, but it is difficult to know how to inter-
pret this evidence due to the absence of precise prove-
nience information from Fowke’s excavation.
Jefferson is often lauded for his use of (negative) evi-
dence to reject the notion that the mounds were bat-
tlefield cemeteries, a conclusion he drew from the
absence of observed physical trauma in the skeletal
material he examined. Jefferson’s observation based
on physical study was extraordinary for its time and
seemingly correct. But, it is noteworthy that some
few individuals did suffer from violent trauma,
though patterns of healing suggest none died from
this violence in the Rapidan Mound. Gold (1999) has
found more abundant evidence of such violence at
other mounds in the complex.

Summary of Bioarchaeological Analyses

The commingled remains of between 1,000 and
2,160 individuals were interred in groups of 15 to 35
over time at Rapidan Mound. Both males and females
of all ages were interred, although it is possible that
some infants and young children were excluded from
certain collective burials.

The osteological evidence indicates that the diet
of the burial population contained a significant
amount of starchy plant food, very likely maize,
although this population did not suffer from the
severe health problems seen with the adoption of
intensive maize agriculture elsewhere in the late pre-
historic southeast. Levels of skeletal injury and
trauma in this population are low.

Reconstruction of the Collective
Mortuary Ritual Sequence

The excavation and analysis of the two intact col-
lective burial features provide unique insights into
the structure of the predominant ritual sequences that
created the mound (see Dunham 1999). Collective
secondary burial complicates and extends the ritual

AMERICAN ANTIQUITY

[Vol. 68, No. 1, 2003]

sequence in ways not seen with individual, primary
inhumations. It begins with the first death of an indi-
vidual following a prior group burial, involves a
longer interim period of processing and temporary
storage, and includes the gathering and final depo-
sition of all those who had died since the last act of
collective disposal.

The presence of secondary burial indicates that
the initial processing and storage of the individual
bodies quite likely occurred away from the place of
final burial, though our limited testing of the area
around the mound did not reveal a locus of that activ-
ity. Possible evidence of prior pit storage for the
skeletons buried collectively at the Rapidan Mound
was recovered by the University of Virginia excava-
tion. Scattered clumps of red clay, found only as a
subsoil stratum on the terraces and hills surrounding
the Rapidan river floodplain, were discovered amidst
the bones composing feature 10, the larger of the two
intact burial features (Dunham 1990).

Six lines of evidence from the two fully excavated
and undisturbed collective burial features allow us
to draw inferences concerning the stages of collec-
tive mortuary ritual that occurred at the Rapidan
Mound. We consider the following: (1) the bones in
the collective features are mingled and tightly clus-
tered; (2) there is no evidence of later Native Amer-
ican cultural disturbance of the bones or surrounding
mound fill; (3) the collective burials are discretely
placed in the mound; (4) there were many (28 and
32 as a minimum in our sample) individuals repre-
sented in these collective burial features; (5) a very
low percentage (2 percent) of the bones show evi-
dence of deliberate disarticulation and/or removal of
soft tissue; and (6) only a few bones are articulated,
and those are from parts of the body that are the last
to disarticulate.

The first three lines of evidence suggest strongly
that each collective burial feature was not formed
gradually over time (by being left exposed on the
mound surface or being uncovered and added to peri-
odically) but was created in a single event. The cumu-
lative evidence also indicates that the act of burial
was collective—in terms of the number of dead and
the ritual participants with obligations or connections
to them. Thus the ritual was performed periodically
when, at certain intervals, the defleshed remains of
the dead were gathered up, brought toa common bur-
ial location, mixed and joined together on the sur-
face of the mound, covered with soil, and left.

REPORTS

The length of time between these repeated col-
lective burial acts cannot be determined with cer-
tainty, but some conjecture is possible. The
well-known ossuary burials of the Huron, which
involved considerably larger numbers of individuals
(estimates range up to one thousand) are reported by
various ethnohistorical sources to have occurred
every eight to twelve years (Heidendreich 1978; Trig-
ger 1969, 1976). Collective burials among Algo-
nquian-speaking peoples of the Great Lakes were in
all likelihood much more frequent, occurring annu-
ally, or, according to one account, every three years
(Hickerson 1960). Algonquian speakers along the
Atlantic coast may have worked within a similar bur-
ial time frame. Ubelaker (1974:67) arrived at an inter-
val of three years for the larger Ossuary II (MNI of
188) at Nanjemoy Creek, based on a ratio of articu-
lated to disarticulated adult individuals and an esti-
mated rate of body decomposition for the
mid-Atlantic area.

The lower population of the individual Rapidan
Mound burial features raises the possibility that their
formation occurred more frequently than the Huron
ossuary burials and may have approached the rela-
tively brief three-year interval projected for the Algo-
nquian ossuaries of the Atlantic coastal plain. In the
coastal plain ossuaries, some fully articulated skele-
tons were found (Curry 1999; Ubelaker 1974). At
Rapidan, most of the skeletons were completely and
naturally disarticulated. Given this slight difference
with the coastal ossuaries, we suggest that the ritual
interment interval may have been just slightly longer,
approximately five years.

It is possible to draw some logical inferences
regarding the social units involved in collective
mound burials in interior Virginia. We suggest that
multiple villages, rather than a single village, con-
tributed to the mound and its associated community
ritual, a point previously inferred by Gardner (1986).
Two separate studies provide additional evidence for
this. First, Gold’s (1999) analysis of life-tables com-
putable at the John East Mound allowed a computa-
tion of a crude mortality rate of 33 deaths per
thousand individuals per year. In addition, she argued
that for every 30 adult individuals represented in the
burial features, an additional 24 infants and children
also died (cf. Ubelaker 1974). With these figures, and
assuming a five-year burial interval, it is possible to
estimate the population contributing to the Rapidan
Mound to be approximately 325 individuals at any

123

one time using Ubelaker’s (1974) formula of P =
1000/MT (where P is population, M is mortality rate,
and T is the interval between burial features [Ube-
laker 1974, 1989]). Gallivan’s (1999) study of James
River piedmont and ridge and valley villages showed
that during the period of use of the Rapidan Mound,
the second half of the Late Woodland, the average
community size was nine households. If we estimate
each household to include six individuals, then the
average village size was ca. 54 people. The model
we envision for the mound communities thus
involves an average of six villages contributing to and
participating in the burial ritual episodes at the Rap-
idan Mound. Given that not every one was likely
buried in a mound, the number of participating vil-
lages and hamlets was probably larger and caution
should be used in extrapolating this figure to a total
population for the region.

The mingling and disposal of the bones was
apparently accompanied by ritual activities con-
ducted nearby. Such coordinated, staged events are
mentioned in ethnohistorical accounts of other forms
of collective burial in eastern North America (Kidd
1953; Heidendrich 1978; Hickerson 1960; Trigger
1976). The remnants of activities possibly connected
to this phase of the collective mortuary sequence—
a possible structure, hearth, and arranged stones—
were found along the southeastern perimeter of the
mound.

Conclusion

How does the excavation at the Rapidan Mound help
us understand the late prehistoric people who built
this mound and others? The cultural significance of
monuments such as these was, as many before us
have noted (e.g., DeBoer 1997), elusive and transi-
tory to those who saw them in use, and so certainly
the same must be said for the archaeologists who
attempt to interpret the end product of centuries of
ritual acts—the mound. In the preceding description
of the Rapidan Mound we have attempted to be
explicit in distinguishing between the ritual acts that
created the mounds from the final monument that
marked the landscape. Following Morris (1991) and
Buikstra and Charles (1999), we agree that the indi-
vidual collective burial features at Rapidan are one
part of a rite of passage that separated the living from
the dead, while the mound as monument speaks to
the appearance of an ancestor cult which reestab-
lished that relationship in different ways and with

new meanings. Why did both appear at this moment
in time in Virginia?

The collective secondary burial features in the
accretional mounds indicate a dramatic change in the
ritual life of the native peoples of Virginia. During
the late prehistoric period, the ritual associated with
the death of many individuals was completed only
intermittently and only ina collective manner. Death
became a more communal rather than a private mat-
ter, for the deceased as well as for the living. Because
a given mortuary sequence unfolded over an
extended period of time, and because ultimately a
large number of people appear to have been placed
in a mound, it can be inferred that most living indi-
viduals were related to the deceased and were directly
involved with one or more aspects of each collective
mortuary sequence or, at the least, were affected by
it. Consequently, burial at a mound assumed the scale
and impact of a public ceremony, a community-wide
event (see Johnson and Earle 1987:199).

Such rituals can play a significant role during
periods of social change and be instrumental in pro-
moting inequality (Aldenderfer 1993; Rappaport
1979). Gallivan’s (1999) research at village sites of
the Virginia interior has suggested that social differ-
entiation increased markedly ca. A.D. 1200, con-
temporaneous with the spread of collective mound
burial. Mortuary sequences can also serve simulta-
neously to counter potentially divisive aspects of
inequality with a ritual that emphasizes and creates
the unity and priority of a society. We don’t see this
as a masking strategy (cf. Hantman 1990; Shanks and
Tilley 1982) but rather as a simultaneous engagement
with hierarchy and equality that is better understood
as a norm in Native American society (McGuire and
Saitta 1996; Plog 1995). As agriculture, surplus pro-
duction, and competition with Algonquian groups to
the east intensified, such a duality of hierarchy and
communality may have been expressed most dra-
matically and publicly in the collective burial ritual
taking place at the mounds.

The product of decades and centuries of such
mortuary-related ritual produced a clear and visible
monument on the landscape, one that may be best
described in terms used to describe ancestor cults
more generally. Buikstra and Charles (1999:
204-205) summarize ethnographic and archaeolog-
ical studies to describe ancestor cults as relating to
land transfer, territory, and exclusivity; shrines asso-
ciated with cults are often located within or adjacent

AMERICAN ANTIQUITY

to communities. It is intriguing that the archaeolog-
ical and bioarchaeological results from the Rapidan
Mound excavation confirm the importance of agri-
culture in the lives of the people buried there. This
interpretation is not insignificant in the light of
colonist John Smith’s depiction of the interior region
as nonagricultural (Hantman 1990). The invariable
location of burial mounds on or near floodplains and
associated with large villages suggests strongly that
they accompanied and presumably helped reinforce
a shift of late prehistoric settlement systems toward
areas most productive for agriculture. The recurring
structure of the collective burial rites and their loca-
tion at fixed and visually prominent cemeteries would
have presumably buttressed this reorientation of the
settlement system by deepening and making more
permanent the cultural significance of particular
floodplains and by effectively compelling the living
to return to them every few years with their recent
dead.

The excavation also provides clear evidence of a
heightened concern with the dead and with forging
and maintaining ties to ancestors during the latter part
of the late prehistoric period. More attention and
greater visibility were given to both the recent and
older dead than in previous centuries. Years rather
than days marked the interval between death and
final burial, necessitating a greater investment of time
and labor in order to coordinate and implement a
growing number of activities in the mortuary
sequence.

The deceased were no longer buried below the
ground surface but were kept above it, placed
together with the older dead of the community to
form an increasingly monumental edifice on the land-
scape. The native peoples of interior Virginia lived
in the growing shadow of their burial mounds, so to
speak, being constantly drawn into an extended mor-
tuary ritual sequence that demanded continual care
of their dead and a periodic gathering at a mound
comprised of their ancestors. Such a valorization of
ancestral ties is almost certainly connected to the
deepening of local descent groups, which, as has
been noted by researchers, are an important organi-
zational mechanism in premodern agricultural
economies (Bender 1989; Charles and Buikstra
1983; Meillassoux 1972; Woodburn 1982).

The mounds are relatively widely spaced and it
is quite intriguing that in the Piedmont region
mapped in the early colonial period by John Smith

(Barbour 1986) there is only one known mound asso-
ciated with the Rapidan River, the territory associ-
ated with the Mannahoac polity by Smith, and one
associated with the James (associated with the local
Monacan polity reported by Smith). Tentatively, we
note that while they served many social roles, the
mounds may also have marked territory and local
control of land and resources. The striking regional
similarity in the mounds in late prehistory speaks to
an inclusive nature of the ancestral cult, which united
the region, marking above all the shared identity of
those who lived where the mounds stood.

We do note that this mode of collective burial is
not without parallels elsewhere in eastern North
America. The use of collective burials in the form of
ossuary pits during the late prehistoric and early his-
toric periods has been documented at several dis-
parate locations. These include the Great Lakes
region (Kidd 1953; Heidenreich 1978; O’ Shea 1988;
White 1978; Wright 1972) and along the Atlantic
coastal plain from North Carolina to Maryland and
in southern New England (Blick 1987, 2000; Curry
1998; Jirokowic 1990; Loftfield 1990; Phelps 1983;
Ubelaker 1974). More specific parallels of collective
burial in mounds may also be seen in the Clemson
Island mounds of Pennsylvania (Stewart 1994), the
mass burial mounds of the Florida Gulf Coast (Sears
1958), and the historic example of collective mound
burial practiced by the early historic Choctaws (Gal-
loway 1995; Swanton 1931, 1946). Future studies
should examine the social and (possible) historical
connections that underlay these particular mortuary
practices. While such comparison is beyond the
scope of this paper, we have here provided docu-
mentation for the accretional burial mounds of Vir-
ginia to add to the ongoing comparative discussion
(cf. Buikstra and Charles 1999; DeBoer 1997).

Notes

1. Although Virginia burial mounds and Mississippian plat-
form mounds are accretional in construction, they were not built
in the same way. There is no evidence that a pre-conceived plan
or shape guided the raising of Virginia burial mounds. Covering
mantles of sod were not used; collective burials, and the sod
covering them, were deposited on only select portions of the
existing mound surface. Virginia burial mounds as a result grew
organically rather than uniformly, retaining an irregularly
rounded, somewhat conical shape as collective burials and sod
were added to various locations on their surfaces.

2. Mortuary ritual sequence, of course, does not necessarily
end with the final deposition of the remains.
