### INTRODUCTION

The name Falls Church derives naturally from a geographic phenomena and from a man-made structure. Located on the line between Tidewater and Piedmont Virginia, the town is near both the Great Falls and the Little Falls of the Potomac River.

The Potomac below Little Falls is tidal - above Little Falls it is beyond the reach of the tides. Since the falls were a barrier both to river navigation and overland transportation, early habitation of the area and a series of trails around the falls were a natural development.

English settlement of the area, beginning in the seventeenth century, brought with it here, as elsewhere, the established Church of England. The contract for the first church in the present city was let in 1733 and completed by October 1734. The present church, begun in 1767, was completed two years later. The church was called the "New Church" until 1746 when another church was built on Rocky Run. That then became the "New Church" and the church at the falls the "Upper Church." After 1757 it is usually referred to as "The Falls Church."

Just as it was natural that the church should take its name from the geographic features which created the need for a settlement at that particular point, it followed that the town which grew up around the church should be called after it. When the village was incorporated by Act of the Legislature on March 30, 1875, it became officially "The Town of Falls Church." Falls Church remained a town until shortly after World War II, when it became an independent city.

To a large extent the history of Falls Church is a history of transportation in Northern Virginia. Indian trails led to settlers' roads. These became rolling roads, and finally turnpikes. In the mid-nineteenth century the railroad pushed track through Falls Church, and shortly before the end of that century, the electric trolley arrived. New settlers, business and growth followed closely behind each improvement in the transportation system. With the unfortunate death of the trolley system in the mid-twentieth century, and the railroad somewhat later, the highways which had succeeded the trails and turnpikes were left to bear the brunt of ever increasing business and growth, so that many of the problems of the present city may also be traced to transportation.

Like other towns, Falls Church did not exist in a vacuum, but was shaped by its neighbors and by events in surrounding areas. The formation of Truro Parish; the establishment of Fairfax County and its county seat near The Falls Church; the establishment of the District of Columbia and the moving of the Federal Government to Washington; the retrocession of Alexandria County from the District to the State of Virginia; the location of Falls Church in a Civil War no-man's land; the establishment of Arlington County; and the growing suburbs of Washington all played a part in Falls Church history and all are covered here to some extent.

In 1971 Falls Church retains a healthy mix of historical background, three-dimensional historical remains, and ongoing development. These give the city a sense of continuity and of community. The intent of this study is to add to and buttress that mix - not simply to recount the past of a town, but to give it a sense of time and place by linking it to history which survives in streets and areas and buildings and people.

Insofar as possible, we have allowed the contemporary records to tell their own story, believing that in that manner the flavor and feel of the history of Falls Church can best be recaptured.

### PRE-EUROPEAN HISTORY TO THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

Prior to the arrival of the Englishman John Smith, in 1608, no European is known to have seen the territory which makes up Falls Church. In that year Smith sailed up the Potomac as far as the "marshes," or Falls. Smith was received variously with either warmth or hostility along the River and at several places ventured inward along the paths and trails of the Indians.

The Indians Smith met in the area of Falls Church were probably Algonquins, titular members of the Powhatan Confederacy. There were Siouxan tribes in the area as well, especially the Manahoac, normally to the north and west of the Falls, while the Algonquins, particularly the Doags, were to the south and east. The territories certainly overlapped, and both tribes ranged through the general area. At least one permanent Indian campsite is thought to have been located within present day Falls Church, on the Crossman Farm, at Lee Highway and Columbia Street.

Though the Indians who occupied the area were small in number, their use of the area around the Falls was intense, and just as streets in Boston, Massachusetts, are said to have followed the cow-paths made by early settlers' cattle, much of the transportation system in Northern Virginia followed the early paths and trails of the Indians. Fairfax Harrison suggests that:

"He who takes his imagination with him over the roads of Old Prince William will warm to a romantic story. Consider what these roads have known. Long before the white man came, there were frequented forest trails leading through the heart of the territory from those natural northern gateways which we call Noland's Ferry, Snicker's Gap, and Ashby's Bent. We all remember that Confederate and Yankee generals once stood on the saddle of the Blue Ridge beneath the giant poplar tree which long marked the county boundary in the last mentioned of those gateways, but we do not all perhaps realize that when that tree was a sapling the buffalo made his way thither seeking the pastures of the Shenandoah. During the mid-seventeenth century the Susquehannock Indians, crossing the Potomac at the mouth of the Monocacy, came hither to establish a plain path all the way across Virginia to the Yadkin villages, where they traded for skins on behalf of the Dutch at Manhattan. Later, and for half a century, the trails the buffalo and the Susquehannocks had opened were the familiar haunts of the far journeying Iroquois, ever extending the sphere of influence of their famous Long House into the South. As these Indian trails gradually became roads, they felt the moccasin-shod foot of the earliest pioneer pushing north into the bluegrass lands of the hills..."

At least one of the Indian trails which played a prominent part in opening the Falls Church area to settlement was the path running from just below Alexandria to Vestal's [Snicker's] Gap. Known by various names during the occupancy of the Europeans, it ultimately came to be known as the Leesburg Pike in the nineteenth century, but it was traveled and described by Europeans as early as 1699. Within present day Falls Church it was met by another trail which led from the Little Falls. The street following the old path still bears the name Little Falls.

These trails could not be adequately exploited by the European settlers until the Indians had been subdued. Pacification came in the Falls Church area with the "Susquehannock War" in 1675-77, after which the Iroquois gradually moved to the north.

Even before this, however, the English colonists were already planning for the use of the Falls Church area and including it in governmental units, though these meant little in terms of settlement of the area until after the close of the seventeenth century. Northumberland County, whose indefinite boundaries stretched northward to the Falls Church area, was formed in 1648. Northumberland was further divided, and ultimately in 1664 Stafford County was created, covering all of present Northern Virginia.

Concurrently with the formation of Northumberland County all of the Northern Neck, including roughly everything between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, was granted in proprietorship by Charles II to seven of his followers - The Proprietors of the Northern Neck. After a series of disputes, misunderstandings, and legal maneuvers, Lord Culpeper finally gained undisputed proprietorship to the Northern Neck in 1688, possession of which through the marriage of his daughter, passed to Lord Fairfax in the eighteenth century.

There seems little doubt that the policy by which land was granted inhibited the development of the area. Robert Carter complained in 1695 that in such grants there was no:

"...lapsing for want of seating...for in the conveyances of the said proprietors there is not any limitation upon that accounte, and accordingly a man may hold 50,000 or more acres by a secure title and that without so much as actually seating or building on any part of it."

It was only as the great grants were built or settled upon by their owners and broken up that the ordinary settler, of modest means and seeking small acreage, came to this area and a settlement pattern began to take shape. In general that process did not begin until well into the eighteenth century, but before 1700 at least one settler may have built a permanent shelter in Falls Church. The house he built, known as Big Chimneys, stood off South Maple Avenue near W. Broad Street until the twentieth century. Over the years it served multiple uses, the two major ones being residence and ordinary. A marker, high in one of the massive stone chimneys which gave the house its name, is said to have been carved with the date "1699." Whether Big Chimneys was built before 1700 or not, it was probably the first permanent structure in Falls Church built by a European.

### THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND THE FALLS CHURCH

In colonial Virginia the governmental unit often preceded the settlers who followed. As the settlers belonged to the Church of England and a new parish was created. As the parish was peopled, a new governmental unit followed. With the spread of settlers into the Northern Neck, the governmental units controlling them became progressively smaller in land area and Prince William County was created from Stafford in 1731.

One year later Truro Parish was created covering all of the upper reaches of Prince William County - roughly everything between the Occoquan River and Bull Run, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Potomac River.

On Saturday, June 19, 1742, the Governor and Council:

"ORDERED that the Court-house for Fairfax County be appointed at a place called Springfield situated between the New Church [Falls Church] and Ox Road in the old Road that goes from the New Church to Ox Road near where the Road from the Little Falls joins the said Old Road between Hunting Creek and Difficult Run..."

Chosen because it was near the center of the projected settlement patterns of the new county, the court house site had to be carved out of the wilderness, an unsatisfactory arrangement so that it was later moved to Alexandria, and ultimately at the end of the eighteenth century to Fairfax where it remains today.

The founding of Alexandria had made the move to that city in 1754 a logical one, while the inclusion of Alexandria in the Federal District of Columbia and the assumption of control of Alexandria by the District of Columbia in 1800 required the move to Fairfax. In its first location, near the intersection of Routes 7 and 123, much of the religious and social life which would normally have centered around the county offices actually revolved around The Falls Church instead. This was the nearest establishment of the Church of England, and the building of a court house nearby brought more settlement to the church than it did to the court house itself. The courts and the church were the two nuclei around which eighteenth century life in Virginia revolved, and the church had already been in existence some ten years when the court house was built, so it was the logical center of growth.

The new Parish soon authorized the construction of new houses of worship. One of these was the first Falls Church authorized in 1733. On June 9 of that year the contract for construction was let to Richard Blackburn who:

"...agreed with this Vestry to build a church at the crossroads near Michael Reagans in this parish of the following dimensions, viz: 40 feet in length, 22 feet wide and 13 feet pitch, to be weather boarded, covered, and all the inside work performed and done after the same manner the work on Occoquan Church is done."

By 1734 the church had been completed and on April 12, 1737:

"John Summers... agreed with this Vestry to pail in the yard about the new church after the same manner the yard about the Church at Pohick is pailed in, only the pails to be sawed, to make good and sufficient shutters for the windows of the said church, and to make and erect two good and substantial horse blocks."

With the actual building of the church the development pattern of the community was in effect established. The church brought new settlers to the crossroads and remained the center of the village for the rest of the eighteenth century.

In 1742, Fairfax County was formed from Prince William, covering what is today Arlington, Loudoun, and Fairfax counties, and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church.

By the middle of the century there were probably several dwellings near the church, though none of them now exist. Shortly after that time the church structure, known first at the "New Church" then as the "Upper Church", came to be known as The Falls Church. That name first appears in the Vestry Book on November 28, 1757, and after that is used consistently for "the church at the crossroads near Michael Reagans," or the "Upper Church."

Within thirty years of the construction of the first church, it was already in disrepair, and the site was being questioned.

"At a Vestry for Truro Parish held at the Falls Church March 28, 1763. Present: Henry Gunnel, Wm. Payne, Jun. Church Wardens; William Payne, Chas. Broadwater, Thos. Wren, Abraham Barnes, Dan McCarty, Robert Boggess and George Washington, Gentlemen, Vestrymen, who being there met to examine into the state of the said church, viz: whether it was in need of repairs and likewise whether the same should be repaired or a new one built, whether at the same place or removed to a more convenient one. Resolved, it is the opinion of this Vestry that the old Church is rotten and unfit for repair, but that a new Church be built at the same place."

This meeting at The Falls Church was the first vestry attended by George Washington, who had replaced William Peake on the Truro Vestry in 1762. The meeting was marked not only by Washington's initiation to the Vestry, but by two momentous decisions for the future town. The first of these was the decision to build a new church, but the second and more important, was to build it on the same site. Shortly after, in 1765, Truro Parish was divided once more, and The Falls Church and the congregation in Alexandria became part of Fairfax Parish, where both remained until the twentieth century when separate parishes were created for each.

James Wren of Falls Church was appointed to the Vestry on November 15, 1766, and at the January 1, 1767, meeting submitted a plan for the new church structure at Falls Church which he not only designed but proposed to build as well. The Vestry had ordered the advertising of two brick churches, one at Falls Church and one at Alexandria. The undertakers were to meet at The Falls Church on January 1, 1767 "and bring in their plans." At the meeting the plan submitted by Wren "was made choice of" for both churches.

Little is known of Wren's early life and training. He was born about 1728, and died at Long View, near Falls Church, in 1818 [now 2606 Ogden Street]. He established a home on the tract known as Winter Hill, and built his house and a tavern in the 300 block of East Broad Street. Wren's became one of the best known taverns in this part of Virginia. Though Winter Hill has disappeared, the Birch House, 312 East Broad Street, one of the early buildings on the Winter Hill tract, still survives.

Wren was evidently a carpenter and joiner for several records of binding apprentices to him exist. On October 2, 1755, Thomas Wren was apprenticed to him to learn the trade, and on April 7, 1763, John Wren apprenticed himself to James for the same reason. Evidently he was already well established in the trade before he was appointed to the Vestry, and must have already gained some renown as a carpenter. His designs for the Falls Church, Christ Church in Alexandria, and the Pohick Church reveal a knowledge of style and symmetry unusual for a carpenter in mid-eighteenth century Virginia, and few others have as many surviving buildings of merit. Wren must have owned architectural style books and probably had studied other structures in the area. He was married in Stafford County in 1753, probably at Aquia Church, which had been built two years earlier. There are many similarities in finish between Aquia and the three churches we know Wren to have designed, so that if he did not actually work on that church, he certainly knew it and learned from it. There is no question of his design of the other three churches however.

Specifications for Wren's Alexandria and Falls Church structures, adopted at the January 1767 meeting, stated:

"The churches at the Falls and Alexandria to be 28 feet from the foundation, that is 3 bricks and a half to the sleepers, 3 bricks to the water table and two and one half from thence. The quoins and arches to be rubbed brick; the pediments to the doors rubbed in the Tuscan order."

The specifications further enumerate type and style of windows, hardware, a cove ceiling, and an altar piece, pulpit and canopy to be finished in the Ionic order.

Evidently, in addition to designing the church and supervising its construction, Wren made the brick as well. The clay pits and kiln still could be seen as late as 1940, about 300 yards from the church on the Old Fairfax Road.

The structure must have been sufficiently completed for use by December 20, 1769, for at a meeting on that date, the building was accepted by the Vestry. Decoration of the interior continued, however. George Washington gave one pound toward that end in March, 1770, and in May Wren submitted a bill of eight pounds for "writing the commandments and making a table for the communion."

Work on a new glebe house was completed in 1775, just in time to witness the beginning of the Revolutionary War. In October 1776, the first Virginia General Assembly held after the Declaration of July 4 in Philadelphia, exempted:

"The different Societies of Dissenters from contributing to the support and maintenance of the church as by law established."

The Anglican church never again enjoyed the exclusive financial support of the citizenry, and in the years following it suffered losses in actual support as well. The gradual decline begun at this time was not to be reversed until the nineteenth century, though the church was not totally separated from the state until 1784.45 That year the Vestry was relieved of its responsibility to care for the poor and for orphans. Provisions were made for the election of overseers of the poor instead, though the Vestry and minister of the church were recognized as a corporation capable of holding church property and administering church affairs. In the future, Vestries were to be elected by the church members rather than by all housekeepers and tax payers in the parish.

Not a great deal of information exists on Falls Church during the Revolutionary War. George Washington continued to serve on the Vestry during the period, and did not resign until after the War was over, in 1784. Charles Broadwater is said to have used the church structure as a recruiting station for Revolutionary soldiers. 46

Broadwater was certainly one of the most colorful citizens of eighteenth century Falls Church. He had been a Sheriff in Fairfax County, an officer in the Virginia Militia in the French and Indian Wars, and a Vestryman of Fairfax Parish. 47 He had advanced to the rank of Colonel by the time of the Revolution.

At a meeting of the freeholders of Fairfax County on July 18, 1774, Broadwater and George Washington lately elected. . .Representatives to serve in the General Assembly," (were) directed to attend the Convention at Williamsburg on August 1st, and present me fangun written by Colonel George Mason. 48

On May 15, 1776, with the same Charles Broadwater and John West, Jr., also a member of the Vestry, representing Fairfax County, a Virginia Convention voted unanimously to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia to seek a Declaration of Independence.

In the summer of 1776, the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the Congress in July, was read to the citizens from The Falls Church as it was from many other churches following its adoption. 49 The immediate area around the church seems to have weathered the rest of the War and the era of the confederacy in relative quietude. But whatever matters influenced the life and thinking of the citizens of the Falls Church area between the Revolution and 1790, the next decade was dominated by the establishment of the national capital.

The Act which led to the establishment of the District of Columbia on the banks of the Potomac, and on land ceded by the states of Virginia and Maryland, was presented to President Washington for signature on July 12, 1790. 50 Washington immediately took up the question of sites, and in January 1791 chose the present site for the capital. The new city was to be ten square miles, and Andrew Ellicott was retained to survey the site, while Pierre Charles L'Enfant was chosen to lay out the city. 51 Ellicott and his surveyors worked their way through the countryside, setting stone markers at the corners of the district and on a straight line between.

On June 26, 1791, Ellicott wrote, from "Surveyor Camp, State of Virginia," "The country through which we are now cutting one of the ten mile lines is very poor. I think for near seven miles, on it there; not one house that has any floor except the earth, and what more strange it is in the neighborhood of Alexandria and Georgetown. We find but little fruit, except huckleberries, and live in a Camp as retired as we used to do on Lake Erie. Labouring hands in this country can scarcely be had at any rate, my estimate was twenty - but I have had to wade slowly through with six, this scarcity of hands will lengthen out the time much beyond what intended. As the President is so much attached to this Country, I would not be willing that he should know my real sentiments about it. . .This country intended for the permanent residence of Congress, bears no more proportion to the country about Philadelphia and Germantown, for either wealth or fertility, than a crane goes to a stork."

The western corner of the new district was established near the intersection of present day Meridian and West Streets. The stone still exists in a small part jointly maintained by the jurisdictions whose boundaries it marks today - Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the City of Falls Church. One other Falls Church stone also survives. This is the number nine, or Greenough stone, which can still be seen at Van Buren Street and Four Mile Run on the border between Arlington County and Falls Church.

When L'Enfant laid out his magnificent city with streets 100 to 110 feet wide, avenues 160 feet wide, and a ceremonial avenue 400 feet wide, 52 all was located to the north of the Potomac, and away from the site of Falls Church. He thus set into motion a chain of events which ultimately established the northeastern boundary of present day Falls Church, and eventually led to the retrocession of the District land on the Virginia side of the Potomac to the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Jonathan Lovett's survey of the roads between Winchester and Alexandria, completed in 1801. One road is through Centreville and Ashby's Gap, and the other through Falls Church and Leesburg.

Lovett chose as his reference point in the village not the church but Col. James Wren's.

Col.
Wren's Tavern was on the Leesburg road 312 East Broad Street] and Lovett's table of distances lists it as
66 miles, 2 quarters, 36½ perches from Winchester,
"4 miles, 2 quarters, 52 perches"
from the Old Court House.
and "7 miles, 3 quarters, 111 perches" from Alexandria. The tavern
was a well known hostelry in 1801. Thomas Jefferson had stayed there, and recommended it to others. In an April 30, 1801 letter to James Madison on the condition of the roads through Fairlax County, Jetterson noted that he had consulted with Colonel Wren, who knows both roads, he says there is no comparison, that you must absolutely come by Fairtax courthouse, all that road being practicable until you come to Little s lane, which you have to encounter whatever way you come. lefferson recommended that Madison start as soon as vou can see to drive breakrast at colonel Wren's and come on here [Washington] to dinner."

The Falls Bridge, later known as Chain Bridge, had been opened to business in 1797,01 and a number of Tumpike Companies were formed in the area, spurred largely by local needs. It was the War of 1812, how-ever, and the attendant difficulty experienced by the Government in the movement of troops and supplies which provided the real spur to road building.
When the British advanced on Washington in 1814 and burned the President's House [White House] and other buildings, the escape route for fleeing President James Madison and other dignitaries was through Falls Church. In addition, important supplies and documents either passed through the town or were stored in the area.

his name on the records. This made it necessary for each voting resident to become publicly either a union or a secession supporter. In some precincts in Fairfax County, union supporters voted to reject secession, then, seeing that the vote was against them, had their vote changed to the secession column. 84 In the County, 1,231 men went to the polls 942 of them voted for secession, while 289 voted against - almost a fourth of those voting.
Fort Marcy [still extant] was one of several earthwork forts to be constructed in a semicircle around Washington, from Falls Church on the north to Alex andria on the south, forming the southern defenses of Washington. Fort Buffalo at the present Seven Corners has disappeared, but there are still remains of the Fort Taylor earthworks in an overgrown area adjacent to Oakwood Cemetery at Roosevelt and East Broad Streets.
In Falls Church precinct no votes were changed and the results were somewhat different. Approximately a third of the voters, 26 out of 70, wished to remain with the Union. Included among them was William A.
Blaisdale, the owner of Cherry Hill. Joining him were
W. H. and Andrew Ellison and Dr. Samuel Groot.
Among the 44 voting for secession were William and
B. F. Shreve, George Minor, H. H. Darne, and Lisander, Charles, and Albert Wren. In the West and Dulany families there were sharp divisions with members voting on both sides.
J. G. Barnard, who had participated in constructing the defenses and who had been hastily called to Washington in 1864 when General Jubal Early's Confederate troops threatened the city, noted in his later report that

On one of their raids, in October of 1864, John B.

men and attempted to alert the Union garrison.
Montioy, with Company D, and with Bush Underwood as guide, moved off towards Falls Church and at night prepared to attack the camp. The pickets were captured, and some of our men were leading horses out of the stables, when the camp was aroused.
The blowing of a horn, which at first was thought by our men to denote the assembling of a party of coon hunters, was discovered to be a signal given by a citizen named Reed to alarm the camp.

Among the many who came to the village during the War, probably no one is today better known than Matthew Brady. A fashionable Washington photographer when the War began, he came to Falls Church at least twice in 1861-62, probably looking much as he did when Margaret Leech described him on his way to Manassas in July of 1861:
lugging his huge camera and plateholder. He was a bushy-haired little Irishman, with a pointed beard and big nose, and he wore a long, light duster and a straw hat.

Earlier in the War, in June of 1861, Julia Ward Howe had watched a "Grand Review"
of troops near
Falls Church, between Bailey's Cross Roads and Munson's Hill. Men from the Falls Church garrison were participating, when a report of enemy movement caused some confusion and dismissal of troops. As Mrs. Howe later told the story:
We returned to the city very slowly, of necessity for the troops nearly filled the road.

The town charter had been amended in 1879 and
1890. By that time the boundaries had been changed and a part of the town to the east of the Methodist Church on the Annandale Road had been receded to

Dr. E. B. Henderson moved to Falls Church in 1910, when there were still vivid memories of the reasons for that transfer. Dr. Henderson had become director of health and physical education in the Negro schools of the District of Columbia in 1904, a post he held for fifty years, and had moved to Falls Church where his wife was already a teacher. In a 1965 oral history session Dr. Henderson noted that
Relations between the two major racial groups in Falls Church have always been very good, but an interesting occurence came several years after the town was organized. There existed in those davs a real two party system. Many of the settlers from the north were Republicans and all the Negroes were Republicans. All the southerners were Democrats and they were the dominant party in Falls Church. To improve the political situation, the colored section was cut off from the town to remain in Fairfax County.
It was not an unusual practice. It was just a simple case of gerrymandering.111a
It was in this era, in 1897, that the trolley line of the Washington-Virginia Railway Company, later known as the Washington, Arlington, and Falls Church line reached Fails Church 112 When combined with the railroad, it offered fast and efficient service to Lees-burg, Alexandria, Fairfax, Washington and scores of intermediate points. These two life lines, the trolley and the railroad, became the dominant forces in shaping the future growth and events of the town.
This transportation system, together with the amenities of the town, and available land, led to its selection for Camp Russell A. Alger, established just outside Falls Church during the Spanish-American War.
Congress had declared war on Spain April 21, 1898, and troops began to assemble at Falls Church. Charles
A. Stewart, in a contemporary account, described the effect of Camp Alger on Falls Church.


## Historical Context
Tony P. Wrenn's work represents a significant contribution to documenting the history of Falls Church. The study likely examines the transition of Falls Church from rural crossroads to established village to suburban community, tracking its growth alongside the development of Northern Virginia and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
