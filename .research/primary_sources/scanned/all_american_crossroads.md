## Description
This document preserves the content of Jeanne Rust's historical work "All-American Crossroads," which examines Falls Church as a significant junction of transportation routes and explores how its position as a crossroads shaped its development and character through history.

## Content
Falls Church, Virginia, was just a little crossroads, six miles from the future site of the nation's capital, when it began to develop in the first part of the 1700's. Caught up in the web of American history early in life, Falls Church watched soldiers march through its streets to the French and Indian War; it participated in the Revolutionary War, gave refuge to President Madison during the War of 1812, saw action in the Civil War, and was host to troops during the Spanish-American War. During the course of its history, Falls Church has been threatened by war, by lack of water, by gun powder, and by metropolitanitis; but, it has survived, been ahead of its time in many ways, and been judged an "All-American City." Its perseverance and initiative go back to the time when Falls Church came into existence because of a good fishing hole!
One of the finest fishing holes in all Northern Virginia in the olden days was the Little Falls of the Potomac.
Indians from many tribes, wearing bear or buffalo skins on their bodies and turkey or goose feathers in their hair, fished from the rocks or their canoes for the big fat sturgeons that swam up the Potomac and stopped momentarily at the rocks of the falls. Sport and pleasure reigned. The usual catch for an evening was 30 sturgeons!
Whole tribes of Indians lived at the mouth of Pimmit
Run. Indians came from the northern ridge of Maryland, from the inland trails of Virginia, and by canoe up the channels of the Potomac to fish, swap stories, and trade.
Others found that the breadth of the Potomac at this point (only 72 feet wide) made crossing over from one
side thick to learn the indianen the white man care, he was quick to learn the Indian's way of getting around Crossing over from Maryland into Virginia, the Indian, and later the white man, found that he had two or three trails leading inland from the falls. One of these was Little Falls Road. About five miles inland, Little Falls Road joined another trail, which followed along a natural ridge from Belhaven (Alexandria) to Leesburg. These two trails became rolling roads for tobacco and the Ridge Road (Route7) became so important that many other roads led to it. Among these were Wilson Boulevard, the Fairfax Courthouse Road, the Sugarlands Rolling Road, and the Falls Rolling Road. At Belhaven, the Ridge Road joined the Potomac Path which led even farther south to the Rappa-hannock. The Potomac Path, the Ridge Road, and the Little Falls Road are considered some of the oldest white man's roads in America.
The intersection of the Little Falls Road and the Ridge Road became an early crossroads of frontier life. A store and a tavern soon sprang up to take care of the traveling hunters, traders, drovers, surveyors, and land speculators.
Colonists hurried to take out patents to use the land for future development.
Among these was Thomas Pearson who patented 660 acres on the south side of Four Mile Run, which included Munson Hill. His son, Captain Simon Pearson, took out seven patents in the Falls Church area during the years
1724-1731. One of these patents included the western half of the City of Falls Church and two miles westward where he established his manor house. This house was a large dormered building with a sweeping roof. Situated on a hill against a background of large English boxwood, it could be seen from Route 7 (see cover).
In 1729 William Gunnell received a patent for 400 acres north of Falls Church and 250 acres on the south side of Four Mile Run.
Michael Regan who had a patent for 179 acres later sold his land to John Trammell and little can be found in the records about Michael Regan. John Trammell took out a patent for 248 acres, which included his home site, now known as "Cherry Hill," and later bought Regan's land.
Thomas Harrison received a patent for 271 acres. He was the son of Burr Thomas Harrison, a scout of one sort or another, who fished on the lower Potomac in the early days of Indian hostility and brought back the message (from a Maryland Indian) that the Senecas had been hired to kill the Virginia colonists. The people fled from their plantations in alarm. Harrison's report turned out to be false but the scare slowed down the development of the Hunting Creek area for years. Thomas Harrison was following in his father's footsteps as a scout, when he heard about the good fishing at the falls and decided he wanted a place there. He got his 271 acres and passed the word along to George Harrison who patented 208 acres.
The Harrison patents adjoined each other and were eventually bought out by Colonel James Wren, who established a large plantation and mansion house known as
"Winter Hill." He also was owner of an ordinary which proved to be a very popular stopping place and center of colonial activity.
Synonymous with the names of Burr Harrison and Simon Pearson was that of Captain Charles Broadwater.
He was a merchant mariner who made trips back and forth from England to Virginia. He soon settled down in Virginia, however, after he wooed and won the rich widow West in a fast-orbiting courtship. He patented 430 acres at

and urine, which were ingredients used for dyeing. Children sat on the covered dye pot and adults sat on a settle in front of the fire. Guests ate corn, potatoes, turnips, and pumpkin at the table with the family, sitting on stools or benches. They slept upstairs in the attic on loose floor boards covered with straw, rags, or their own blankets. If the owner was well-to-do, the ordinary had a parlor which doubled as a bedroom and had lean-to's or separate sheds for tanning, drying meat, etc.
"Big Chimneys," which was built in Falls Church in 1699, was one of these. As time passed, its log cabin exterior was painted white and vines and roses climbed up its immense chimneys and over its moss covered roof, giving it the appearance of an English cottage. Boxwood and flowers covered its grounds and a wooden fence kept out roaming cattle. Little bird houses were carved in the front gate posts, which supported wisteria vines. The brasses on the door were kept polished and the handmade glass windows sparkled behind Dutch shutters. The parlor, with its low ceiling, had one wall of scenic wall paper and a black walnut mantel. The entire side wall of the kitchen was a fireplace and Dutch oven. The house was surrounded by dependencies, including a smoke house and wash house.
A date stone in one of the twenty-foot chimneys had the date 1699 carved on it. About that time, the Little Falls Road ran in front of "Big Chimneys," intersected with the original Ridge Road south of the ordinary, and meandered on its way to Ravensworth. Being located within a stone's throw of the intersection of these two main roads, "Big Chimneys" was assured a daily supply of weary travelers.
Another ordinary was located on the west side of Falls Church on the Ridge Road near Pearson's house. It was also a story and a half log building, similar in appearance to "Big Chimneys." It had a robust and lively clientele.
At the same time Simon Pearson was having his trou-bles, the big tracts were beginning to break up and small farms were being occupied by indentures, who in turn were hiring convicts to work for them. As these questionable characters came into the upper regions of the colony, the Assembly temporarily stopped creating counties. and instead started creating parishes, which divided the land but did not give voting rights to the holders. The vestrymen of the parish had to act as county court judges. They had to take care of moral misdemeanors, administer to the poor, discipline vagrants, and procession land (decide boundaries for tithing). If they did not fulfill these duties, they were dismissed,
The parishes tried to set up meeting places wherever the people showed their desire to worship. William Gun-nell, who had moved inland from Alexandria, persuaded the Assembly that a group of people who had been worshiping in his home needed a meeting place. Michael Regan, who was in the group, offered to give two acres of land.
The Assembly looked the area over, decided that the church should not be far from Alexandria but should be fairly near the falls. The intersection of the Little Falls Road and the Alexandria Ridge Road (Route 7) seemed to be the ideal place from the standpoint of accessibility, future growth, and need. A wooden church was built near the intersection on two acres of Michael Regan's land and the Assembly thought of it as the new church or upper church. The people, however, thought of it as the church near their beloved falls and it was inevitable that the new church should eventually be known as the Falls Church and that the community which grew up around it would go by the same name. It was in this way that the community of Falls Church came into being (See plat).

Graves behind the tavern and blood stains on its floor told stories of drunken brawls, duels, and murder.
As the wealthy landowners moved up to occupy their plantations, which had been run by indentures, a society of gentlemen evolved within the Falls Church area. The gentry included the Pearsons, Regans, Gunnells, Tram-mells, Wrens, Harrisons, Broadwaters, Minors, Robertsons, and Adamses. Their mansion houses and plantations were in and near the Falls Church area. They owned or rented slaves, rode in fine carriages, and dressed in velvet and satin. Mrs. Broadwater "held court" seated in her chair of state, with a maid on either side waving peacock fans. A royal governor established his royal hunting lodge in Falls Church. The families living there inter-married with each other and with wealthy landowners, like the Brents and Wests, farther south. Land passed from father to son and from one family to another through marriage. The sons continued the traditions their fathers had followed before them and acted as burgesses, vestrymen for the parishes, and patriots. Captain Pearson's son, Simon, was an unfortunate exception.
His future looked great and he was headed for the House of Burgesses when he met and married Milkey Trammell. He found after a few years they couldn't get along but divorce seemed out of the question since it took an Act of the Assembly to get one. So, he and Milkey (Milcah) parted and Simon went his separate way, living with another young lady without benefit of divorce or re-marriage. He left his dwelling to her and their son but his first wife proclaimed her dower interest in the house and land for their son. When George Washington bought some of Pearson's land, the legal tangle of Pearson's relationship with these two women was a stumbling block for many years and his private life became public prop-erty.

The two acres of land which Michael Regan gave for the church were near the ordinary, "Big Chimneys," and near the supplementary warehouse for tobacco that fed into the warehouses at the falls and Alexandria. Plans began to take shape and in the excitement either a deed to the land was forgotten or Regan died (or moved away) and Trammell bought his land. About ten years later when it was discovered that the church had no deed to the land, John Trammell sold the two acres to the Vestry of Truro Parish for fifty shillings sterling, and gave them a deed.
In the meantime (1733) Richard Blackburn, who is commonly thought of as the architect for Mt. Vernon, built a small wooden church, forty feet long and twenty-two feet wide, making the inside as much like Pohick Church as pos-sible. In 1748 George Mason was elected to the vestry and by 1749 the vestrymen decided to have an addition built to the church. Charles Broadwater was hired to build the addition. In 1762 George Washington was appointed to the vestry and soon afterwards the vestry decided to build two new brick churches, 2,400 square feet in size, with high ceilings and galleries. One was to be built in Falls Church to replace the wooden church and the other (Christ Church) was to be built in Alexandria. The plans were drawn and executed under the supervision of James Wren, descendent of the famous English architect. The old wooden church, which was not worth repairing, was sold and moved away.
The new church was constructed with bricks from Wren's kiln and since there is evidence of an old kiln near the church, it is possible he constructed a supplementary kiln near the church to expedite the building of the brick structure. The walls and ceilings of the church had three coats of plaster; the interior of the church had the finest panelling, cornices, and molding available; the altar, pulpit,
9and canopy were enhanced with Ionic columns. Everything was the best man could provide.
When the church was completed the vestry undertook to buy a glebe for its rector. In these days "the glebe" was very important to the minister for he had to help support himself by raising produce on his land. In 1770 the church wardens of the Falls Church and Christ Church bought 516 acres east of the church for their rector and had a "Man-sion House," kitchen, dairy, meat house, barn, toilet, ete., built on it. The house (home of Mrs. Frank Ball in Arling-ton) was hardly finished before many changes came about due to the outcome of the Revolutionary War and among them was Jefferson's effort to separate the church from the state. A law was passed confiscating the glebes for the poor. When the vestry finally cleared their title to the glebe, they sold it and acquired a rectory opposite the
church.
At the time that Washington was attending Falls Church (reportedly, his first), he was also constantly on the road from Alexandria to Leesburg, surveying and attending to public business. General Braddock's men took the Ridge Road to Ft. Dugesne and camped in the Falls Church yard on their way. When the Revolutionary War broke out, the church became a recruitment center under the direction of Charles Broadwater. Later, the Declaration of Independence was read from its steps. When LaFayette visited Falls Church in 1824, he respectfully tipped his hat to the church as he passed. He spent several hours at "Big Chim-neys." The church at this time was almost deserted. Animals and tramps wandered in and out through its open doors and broken windows. The professors and students of the Virginia Theological Seminary became concerned and began to hold services in the church. Soon, enough interest was aroused to repair the church. Captain Henry Fairfax, who was the grandson of a former rector, financed the res-
10
toration of the church and a tablet commemorating his help was placed on the front wall of the church.
It is possible that the influx of people to Falls Church during this period helped revive the church and the area.
When the United States Government was moved from Philadelphia to Washington in 1800, there was a gradual influx of workers to Falls Church. Washington at that time was a swampy and marshy area. Hotels were so scarce Congressmen had to sleep in rooms where four to eight people stayed. Falls Church was only six miles from Washington; the climate was ideal and the land was rich and well drained. Also, at that time, Virginia had ceded a part of her land to be used for the national government and there was a possibility that the government would eventually reach out into the area of East Falls Church. When stone markers were placed at one-mile intervals for the new boundaries, two markers were located in Falls Church. Among the people who came in at this time were the Reeds, Osborns, Munsons, Baileys, Ives, Klocks, McCauleys, Coes, Bartletts, Thornes, and Almond Birches all from the north. Equally important to the revival of the area were the Southerners who moved into Falls Church. They included the Elliotts, Mills, Febreys, Sherwoods, Fishes, Thompsons, Murrays, Paynes, Nelsons, Lynches, Lightfoots, Sewells, Taylors, Scotts, Darnes, Gotts, Donaldsons, Morans, and Dulanys.
There were three churches: Episcopal, Baptist, and Methodist. A new tavern called "Star Tavern" was built.
It had an ingenious green, glass, candle-lit star on top of a pole at its entrance a forerunner of fluorescent-light ad-vertising. Taylor's Tavern was probably built around this time, also. It was constructed near the site of an old Indian trading post at Seven Corners. Both taverns were more livable than the earlier ordinaries and each had a front porch on which were posted all the latest news, prices, wanted lists, etc.

When the Civil War came, Falls Church's young men joined both sides. In one family two brothers served for the South and two brothers served for the North. People in the town were involuntary hosts to both sides. Yankee troops riding through the town would draw up to a house, stop to rest and feed their horses, then raid the vegetable garden, orchard, and pantry. They might be just gone when a Confederate group, looking for Yanks, would stop to eat and to rest and feed their horses.
At the beginning of the war, after the First Battle of Manassas, Rebels were all over the area (see picture) and particularly on Munson Hill. General Longstreet was headquartered at the Lawton House in Falls Church and J. E. B.
Stuart could look down from his strategic outpost at Munson Hill and count the tents of Yankee troops spread over the Potomac Valley and around northeast Falls Church.
People in Washington could see the Confederate flag flying from the top of Munson Hill. The Northerners sent up the balloon, "Union," to appraise the situation. The Rebels fired at the Balloon and it soon disappeared, but not before telegraphing back that "Falls Church and its girdle of encampments was a superb scene." Stuart played up the deception of his strength by building bonfires at night and having his soldiers parade in front of them. He and his men built fake breastworks on Munson Hill, painted big logs black at one end and placed them in such a position that, to the Yankees at a distance, they looked like forty-four pound guns (see picture). He even got two observation, balloons, inflated them, and placed them in full view.
The young Yankees took great sport in sneaking down to the cornfields below Munson Hill and shouting insults at

As the war wore on, Col. John Singleton Mosby made many raids into Falls Church- capturing spies, shooting some, and hanging others. A legend that Mosby hanged a Yankee spy from a large pin oak tree in the 300 block of West Broad was handed down from one generation to another until the tree became known as "Hangman's Tree." It was a local landmark until 1968 when due to lack of care it died, was cut down and hauled away.
The Yankees took their toll of spies from Falls Church, too. The Scott sisters, who had been instrumental in capturing a Yankee captain, were taken to prison. Lida Merry, a young boy, was employed, imprisoned, and shot at by

both sides. Mosby, himself was shot by Yankee cavalrymen near Falls Church.
Army pay rolls and family fortunes were buried in and around Falls Church never to be recovered. Homes and churches were ruined by troops and their horses. The Falls Church was occupied by Federal troops who used it as a hospital and later a stable for horses, tearing up its floors and kicking out its windows. Its font was stolen but fortunately retrieved by the quick-thinking lady who was asked to mail it out of town. The fence around the Falls Church was used for firewood. The other two churches received much the same treatment. Fairfax Chapel was completely destroyed by Union troops who used its bricks to make chimneys for their winter quarters. A bureau drawer was used for a trough for horses at "Cherry Hill." Furniture was stolen from various homes. Gardens and orchards were ruined. Houses were burned. Taylor Tavern was riddled in a tragic volley between two Union forces who thought they were fighting the enemy. Railroad ties and rails were stacked and burned. The whole area was ravaged by the war.
The slaves' background in Falls Church was diverse.
The Methodists did not approve of owning slaves but some owned them anyway and others rented them from neigh-bors. One slave, who had been freed and was interested in preaching, sold his children into slavery to get enough money for a church. Another freed slave was so well thought of he became a member of the Town Council in
1881. His father, during his lifetime, accumulated a great deal of land. Seven Corners was later built on part of his land.
There were many skilled artisans among the negro population. There were stone masons, carpenters, well-diggers, shoemakers, merchants, musicians, and builders.
23
Many of the slaves helped their own masters during the war; one had his ear blown off in an attempt to save his master. After the war, when the slaves were freed (includ ing the children of the Negro preacher) many of them continued to work for their masters and sometimes cared for children in their own homes.
After the war, a real effort was made towards rehabili-tation. The churches were restored, buildings were recon-structed, railroad beds were rebuilt, a public school was started, etc. Soldiers who had fought around Falls Church returned to its pleasant surroundings to live and make their homes. During this period of influx the Buxtons, Kingsleys, Mankins, Crossmans, Churches, Duncans, Gor-dons, Edmonds, Fellows, Flaggs, Hirsts, Lees, Mills, Rusts, Mutersbaughs, Leonards, Ponds, Coppers, Mabens, Stead-mans, Piggotts, Nolans, Rices, Rileys, Nourses, and Browns were among the many people who moved into the area-some from the north and some from the south and some from the mid-west. Another toll gate was opened on the southeast corner of Route 7 and Shreve Road. A saloon was opened but the ladies of the village soon closed it down.
The Falls Church Quarry was opened and stone from the quarry was used when the Falls Church Bank, the Falls Church Presbyterian Church, and the second Columbia Baptist Church were built. By 1875, Falls Church became a town, incorporating land from Fairfax County and Arling-ton, which was then Alexandria County (see Appendix).
The first woman was elected to the Town Council. Before 1900 there were nine churches (Episcopal, Catholic, Pres-byterian, First Congregationalist, two Baptist, and three Methodist), a school for retarded children, a town hall, three stores, a bakery, a black-smith shop, a wheel-wright shop, a funeral parlor, a drug store, a livery stable, an Odd Fellows Hall, and a hotel.
Falls Church was one of the first places in its area to have telephone and electric light service. Four newspapers were started in this period. Electric car tracks were laid parallel to the Washington and Old Dominion tracks and the electric train to Washington gave excellent service, running every half hour from early in the morning until midnight. People planted flowers along the Washington and Old Dominion tracks, which had been first laid circa 1857, and paid twenty-five dollars to have a waiting shed erected at their property line. The train would always stop there and the station was named for them.
Along came the Spanish-American War and Falls
Church again was host to troops. Camp Alger was established near Falls Church. Headquarters for the Signal Corps was at the present site of National Memorial Park and tents for the Provost Guard were located at the electric railway terminal. President McKinley came to Falls Church often during this time and Carl Sandburg was among the soldiers stationed there. He lived in a tent, answered roll call six or seven times a day, built a bunk out of saplings, and drilled along with the rest. Falls Church was kind to the soldiers, opened up its homes to them, and tended to the sick. However, water was so scarce that large barrels of water were hauled in from Washington by the army.
By 1919, Falls Church was considered by some to be a dormant village where you didn't count if you hadn't lived there fifty years. Others felt that it was an intellectual town with an university environment (although there was no university). This group formed the Lantern Club which was a very select group of intellectuals who were supposed to meet once a month for intelligent discussion. Al-though, at first, the club was very successful, it finally faded away.
Gradually, the downtown area is changing; landmarks are disappearing. Yet, communities, like friends, are important and the old adage might apply:
"Make new friends, but keep the old.
The first are silver, the latter gold."
Falls Church is located at the intersection of two of the oldest roads in America. It has the site of the earliest ordinary in the Northern Virginia area and one of the earliest known "old field" schools. It has the first church George Washington attended. It is rich in Civil War history and is the first place where a telegram was sent from a balloon. It was a refuge for one man during his Presidency and for another prior to his becoming President. It was chosen as an All-American City. The historical heritage of Falls Church is as All-American as the city itself.



HISTORIC
FALLS CHURCH
INTRODUCTION
Native Americans traversed two main trails that crossed at a point where one led to Alexandria and the other to a favored fishing spot at the Potomac falls, where the shallow water served as the easiest crossing point into Maryland. One of these trails followed a natural ridge in the geography,
providing easier terrain to traverse between the hills and abundant creeks feeding the fields of the countryside. Where the heavily trafficked trails crossed- now roughly the intersection of Broad Street and Little Falls Street an ivy-encased log cabin sealed with oyster shell mortar and containing enormous towering chimneys on either end staked its claim. A wooden church soon followed nearby. The legacy of that first church near the falls of the Potomac River ultimately gave the evolving village its name.
The community around the church grew with the birth of the US government, even before its seat was relocated from Philadelphia to the opposite shores of the Potomac, a mere six miles away. As vestrymen of Truro Parish- the parish The Falls Church belonged to--George Washington, George Mason, and Charles Broadwater were actively involved in Falls Church activities before the Revolution. Due to its close proximity to what became the nation's capital, the history of the country and this small town were and still are inseparably intertwined.
Despite living in the shadow of big government and being a passenger on its coattails through
time. the town managed to maintain a unique identity with a story of its own to tell containing
sumprIsing twIsts.
Wars have profoundly impacted the town and its evolution, as every war fought has swept citizens of Falls Church along not as mere spectators but often as awkward participants. The town's popular ordinary, Wren's Tavern, was the site of much of this history, from getting visits and a recommendation from Ben Franklin to harboring War of 1812 refugees from Washington and even a visit from passing Pres. James Madison while in search of his wife. One of the founding families associated with one of the most recognizable historic sites and community spaces in the city, Cherry Hill, may not have met had it not been for the arrest of an accused female spy during the Civil War.
Military history was also made in the skies above the village during the Civil War as the war marked a key turning point for the village. Falls Church had been devastated by battles fought on its edges and soldiers tromping through local farms, stealing anything in sight. However, many soldiers who fought in and around Falls Church decided to settle there after the war, causing the first boom in population. Leading up to the Civil War and beyond, several key African American families successfully championed equality in education and stature, with the positive impact of their unending efforts felt nationwide.
Influences of war aside, the founders of the developing town laid a foundation of core beliefs in education and community involvement, which have persisted in modern times. Several early families donated the land and financial resources for early churches and schools. Nature and preservation programs to beautify the village and involve citizens began more than a century ago, resulting in several noteworthy historic trees, which are still alive throughout town.
THE FALLS CHURCHES
There is no better place to start than with the churches of Falls Church, given that the town was named after the Colonial-era church, The Falls Church. Churches oversaw moral codes in the Colonial community, mustered the military, saw to the poor, ill, and feeble, and taxed the landowners in their parishes. Taverns, also known as ordinaries, served as local community gathering places to share news and events and also welcomed travelers with food and a place to sleep.
The vestry for Truro Parish was responsible for collecting tithes from the parishioners and establishing land boundaries. The men elected to the vestry were of the utmost trustworthy and discreet character. Most landowners at that time owned grants from the British crown on their plantation acreage. Tobacco served as the main form of currency of the time, with church builders and pastors being paid in such. Little Falls Street was known as the "rolling road," as merchants wheeled casks filled with tobacco to the warehouses and ports in Alexandria, where it was checked for quality. With the change from Anglican to Episcopalian after the Revolution and the separation of church and state, more churches from other denominations sprang up in Falls Church, most of which are still in existence today.

In order to keep pace with the local industry, the village required top-notch transportation for local merchants and farmers to take their crops into Washington to sell. Town leaders also wanted western goods to easily find their way into town. Therefore, the sometimes impassible dirt carriage tracks required upgrading, and a toll was established on Leesburg Pike.
With the advent of trains in the mid-1850s, tracks were laid through the heart of town, acquiring property through several farms. The train revolutionized travel for local citizens and further improved with the addition of an electric trolley line. However, the mass production of automobiles marked the beginning of the end for the financially unstable railway and further evolution of the roads connecting what had previously been remote villages requiring a day's ride to reach.
Ultimately, the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority acquired the land the tracks ran through and turned it into a recreation path. Falls Church was the first city to pave over the tracks to see how residents would use it. The Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD) trail svstem now carries more people than it ever did during its heyday as a railroad. What the trains did do, however, was turn sleepy Falls Church into a main commuter suburb of Washington, allowing more people to discover its fresh air and open land while maintaining federal jobs in the city.

Leesburg Pike was made into a corduroy road by laying logs across it, and the earliest tollgate in the area was set up to help pay for the improvement. In this 1874 sketch, Nancy Williams is shown collecting the toll. Local agricultural economy depended on reliable roads. The turnpike, chartered in 1813 and completed in 1839, carried most of the freight between Alexandrias pot and inland markets until railroads assumed the role in the 1850s.
The East Falls Church and West Falls Church (or West End) stations were only a mile apart.
Wood-burning trains preceded the coal engines. Residents planted flowers along the tracks and paid $25 to erect a waiting shed at their property line, after which the train would stop there and the station would be named for them. During the Civil War, the tracks west of Vienna were destroyed by the Confederates. The military took over the railway from Alexandria to Vienna, re-lettering the only remaining locomotive, Clarke, the U.S. Military Railroad. The train only met battle once, when a cavalry ambushed the military train outside Vienna and it became accidentally uncoupled by a cannonball. The engineer fled at full speed towards Falls Church, leaving the cars behind. The Confederates withdrew, believing the train would return with reinforcements, but it did not. The outnumbered Union troops wearily trudged on foot back to Arlington after the Confederates burned the remaining abandoned train cars. (Both, NVRPA.)

BLAZING THE
CIVIL RIGHTS TraIl
ing early bsequent
While the trails and dirt-packed crossroads transformed into turnpikes and railway networks, another trail was blazed in the Falls Church community. Thanks to the strength and local efforts of both free and enslaved African American citizens of Falls Church, the path to equality was fought and earned locally and carried influence nationally.
A local Columbia Baptist pastor's belief that his black followers should have enough education to enrich their lives ultimately led to his death at the hands of Mosby's Raiders. However, the Baptist pastors left the community empowered enough to create their own churches. Enslaved men braved death to escape and fight for freedom during the Civil War, returning to Falls Church as free, land-owning citizens.
Many of the descendants of those first families still reside in the city, which was transformed thanks to the nationally reaching efforts of the Tinner and Henderson families. The times were not without struggle, and the town and county leaders did not always put the interests of the African American community first, at one point gerrymandering the boundaries of the town to shift the bulk of Lincoln supporters outside the town voting district.

Upon his return from war, George Brice arranged with absent local landowners still away at war to farm their property in exchange for a portion of the crops. Soldiers destroyed most of the crops Mr. Brice raised, and after the war, the Brices filed a claim for compensation of the lost crops. It is unclear if they were ever compensated. Harriet Brice's Southern Claims testimony from 1871 read as follows: "I am the wife of the claimant.
In 1864-65 I lived at Falls Church.
..He
lived on the piece of land I bought of mine.
We had 12 acres of corn destroyed by
Sheridan's cavalry..
.. We didn't accumulate
anything after they came along and took possession." (Both, National Archives.)
A former slave, Frederick Foote St. purchased about 39 acres from the Minor family following the Civil War with money he had earned working as a blacksmith for
Union troops.
A respected black
businessman in the community, Foote served Falls Church for 10 or more years, first as town sergeant from 1876 to 1880 and then as a town councilman from 1880 to 1889. Foote's land, originally known as Fort Buffalo, was freed for development only after Foote's descendants convinced a court to invalidate his last will and testament, which had forbidden them to allow his 39 acres to leave the family, in 1956. The land became Seven Corners, one of the region's first suburban malls, and a little country orchard transformed overnight into the large Seven Corners shopping center.
On December 14, 1914, the town council adopted the Virginia Senate act approved on March 12, 1912, providing for designation of segregated districts for whites and hlacks. Joseph
B. Tinner (left), E.B. Henderson, and others spoke on the subject.
The ordinance was enacted, and the council's segregation committee was instructed to prepare a map showing the boundaries of segregation districts. (MRSPL, Joseph B Tinner.)

African Americans continue to be counted among Falls Church's notable citizens, and Tinner Hill, settled by blacks after the Civil War, is home to descendants of those original families today, including the Tinners and the Hendersons. The settlement was a short distance south of the town limits, described in Charles Stewart's A Virginia Village in 1904 as "consisting of probably a hundred cottages with a population of between four and five hundred. They have a school building and three churches." Joseph Tinner became an important figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the encouragement of Edwin Bancroft "E.B?» Henderson. Henderson and Tinner founded the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) with Tinner, a great speaker, serving as president. The CCPL succeeded in defeating the segregation ordinance and advanced numerous civil rights endeavors. The organization later became the first rural branch of the NAACP.
Due to their activism, the Hendersons became the target of threatening phone calls, letter, and a burning cross on their front lawn. Despite the threats against them, their efforts not only affected their community but also helped shape the nation. Mary Ellen was principal of the Falls Church Negro School and later the James Lee Elementarv School, which provided quality education to Falls Church -area minority students until local schools were desegregated. Older pupils were bused to school in Manassas. E.B. and Mary Ellen bought and moved into this Sears kit house on land on South Maple Avenue in Falls Church where they raised their two sons. At one point, the house had a barn a distance behind it. Lee Highway was built between the house and barn, so E.B. moved the house closer to Maple Avenue and added a carport.

Pastoral tobacco plantations on hundreds of acres of British-granted land patents slowly gave way to divisions of property into smaller farms as the initial families settled into Falls Church.
The community growing up around the brick church and Wren's Tavern bonded. Still relatively sparsely populated through the Civil War, families began finding Falls Church a hishly desirable location to settle in after the war, including many soldiers who passed through the town during their tours.
Federal employees who wanted to live outside the boundaries of Washington, DC, saw Falls
Church as the perfect country village full of fresh air and abundant trees on gently rolling hillsides, ideal for residences and close enough to get to their jobs. The commuter suburb began evolving around that era. As the community grew, so did the yearning for its own governing body separate from Fairfax County, particularly since the population in Falls Church outnumbered that of any other Fairfax community at one point. Several characters stand out as the anchors and catalysts in Falls Church's path to independence, namely Joseph S. Riley and Merton Church.


## Historical Context
Jeanne Rust's examination of Falls Church as a crossroads community provides valuable insight into how transportation networks influenced community development in American towns. Falls Church's unique position at the intersection of major travel routes contributed significantly to its growth patterns, commercial development, and cultural identity.
