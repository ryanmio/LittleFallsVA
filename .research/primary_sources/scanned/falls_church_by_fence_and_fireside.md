# Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside

## Source Information
This document captures content from "Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside," which appears to be a historical account of Falls Church focusing on the personal and community aspects of its development.

## Description
"Falls Church: By Fence and Fireside" explores the more intimate side of Falls Church history, focusing on the families, homes, and daily life that shaped the community. As suggested by the title, the work likely emphasizes the domestic and social aspects of Falls Church's development - the stories shared by neighbors across fences and within homes around firesides.

Other nearby camps included Nameroughquena, across the old Long Bridge from Washington, and Assomeck, below Alexandria. Also near Alexandria was a camp called Namasingakeut. The powerful Dogs and Sus-quehannocks who roamed in this area, probably vied for these sites as a base for their hunting and trading expeditions. One tribe operated an extensive soapstone quarry at Falls Church.?
The Indians and the settlers were seldom on friendly terms-and it is no wonder! In recent years bones have been found indicating that some of the terrible Susquehannocks may have been eight feet in height. Smith commented that the local Indians had broad noses flat and full at the ends, and had "great bigg lippes, and wyde mouthes..." He says the Patawomeck Indians camped along the Potomac.
In 1675, the Indian problem came to a climax in the "Susquehannock War." Following this, the procession of local settlers increased. Previously, the Virginia and Maryland sides of the Potomac suffered greatly from Indian aggression. The local Indians crossed the Potomac to attack the settlers in 1675, beginning a war of typical guerilla tactics, including theft and depredation 3
For about a year or more the war was fought in a desultory manner in Virginia and Maryland, with the result that the Indians were permanently driven from the area. A first hand account of the war is to be found in a letter, dated July 13, 1705. from Thomas Matthews (Burgess from Stafford County) to the Honorable Robert Harley, Esquire. English Secretary of
State
In his letter Matthews wrote that "About the year 1675, appear'd three prodigies in that country, which from th' attending disasters, were looked upon as ominous presages." He then speaks of a comet "streaming like a horse taile westwards" every evening for a week, and "fflights of pigeons in breadth nigh a quarter of the midhemisphere, and of their length was no visible end.
" This sight put the "planters under the more portentious
apprehensions, because the like was seen (as they said in the vear 1640 when the Indians committed the last massacre, but not after, untill that present year 1675." The third of the "prodigies" was swarms of "flyes about an inch long, and big as the top of a man's little finger, rising out of spigot holes in the earth, which eat the new sprouted leaves from the top of the trees without other harm, and in a month left us."

If a person could recruit five or more additional immigrants, he was given two thousand acres. Any one who acquired one thousand acres in Maryland was entitled to become Lord of a Manor" with feudal rights. In Virginia, "King™ Robert Carter owned three hundred thousand acres. William Fitzhugh owned fifty thousand acres of land. The large majority settled on smaller tracts, and these included artisans and small farmers.

Towns did not grow up, although some small trading posts did. Each plantation was a self-contained unit. Life centered about the plantation, where the planter in his mansion, surrounded by his family and retainers, was a patriarch mildly ruling and entertaining every one. It was the life of the fam ily and not of the great world, and produced that intense attachment to the soil which is a characteristic of Virginians to this day. The public or political character of Virginians corresponded to their private one, haughty and jealous of their liberties, impatient of restraint, symbolized in men such as Mason, Jefferson, Washington, and a host of others.

The land was originally covered with virgin timber except for meadows and corn fields used by the Indians. The forests were sacrificed for tobacco culture. By 1635. tobacco cultivation had become one of the most profitable enterprises in Virginia. The expanding European market assured the planters of a steady demand for all that they could produce.

The Church
On
The Road to The Falls
Els church is unique in at least one way. Iris the only Fals Church in the
United States. It was the name of a church before it was the name of a vil-lage; therefore the present city owes its existence to a church rather than to a store, court house, or landmark. It is fitting to give a history of the church to which the city is indebted. At the time the church, later called "Falls Church" was founded, there was nothing in this area except plantations and small farms, and here and there an occasional Ordinary (tavern). The road to the Little Falls of the Potomac was intersected by the road from Alexandria to Leesburg, once known as Middle Turnpike, and now known as Leesburg Pike (Broad Street). It was at this crossroads "on the road to Little Falls* and about three miles distant, that the Falls Church was built In 1730 Prince William County was taken from Stafford County, above Chappawamsick Creek and Deep Run, and along the Potomac River, to the
"Great Mountains." This became known as the Hamilton Parish boundary when that parish was created. By an Act of the General Assembly, May, 1732, Hamilton Parish was divided, effective the following November, into two parishes. One of them was marked or bounded "By the river Ockoquan, and the Bull Run, (a branch thereof,) and a course from thence to the Indian Thoroughfare of the Blue Ridge Mountains." (Indian Thoroughfare was later Ashby's Gap.) That portion which remained in Prince William retained the name of Hamilton Parish, "and all that other part of the said county, which lies above those bounds, shall hereafter be called and known by the name of Truro." Truro Parish was later divided into smaller parishes, which include the Parishes of Cameron, Fairfax, Shelburne (all instituted in colonial days) and the later Parishes of Johns, Upper Truro, McGill, and a portion of Meade. Truro Parish was named for the ancient parish of that name in Corn-wall, England.
Truro Parish was instituted by Act of the Assembly which provided that the sheriff of the County should summon the freeholders and housekeepers to meet and to elect so many of "most able and discreet persons in the said
Parish as shall make up the number of Vestrymen in the said Parish twelve

JoviE most abl and discreet persons" were elected: Charles Broadwater, John Lewis, Rich. ard Osborn, Gabriei Adams. and Edward EmmSohn Herytord, An st atos that anese men together with Dennis MoCarty, John I superriband Edwary Barry, having taken the oaths appointed by Law, and Subscribed to be con.
Barm'ble to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, took their
places in the Vestry accordingly.
aces first vestry meeting was held on November 7. 1732, at which time Edward Barry was nominated and elected derk. John Heryford and Edward
Emms were chosen churchwardens for the next year, and were
"sworn ac
cordingly." The vestry book here begins for the first time, with recitation of the Act of the Assembly instituting the parish. The second meeting was held March 26. 1733, and at that time John Sturman and Giles Tillett were added to the vestry, and also listed are the names of Francis Awbrey (of Awbrey's Ferry) and William Godfrey, not previously mentioned. At this meeting it was decided to build the first Falls Church: "Ordered that the Churchwardens give publick notice to workmen to appear at the next Vestry to be held for this parish to agree for the building of a church at the cross roads near Michael Reagans in this parish."
At the meeting held April 16, 1733, Michael Ashford was declared on oath a vestryman of the parish and "subscribed to the test." At this time an agree ment was made with the Reverend Lawrence DeButts to preach three times a month for one year, "at Occoquan Church, the new Church, or William Gunnell's. (Falls Church) and at the Chappell above Goose Creek for the sum of eight thousand pounds of tobacco clear of the Warehouse charge and abatements, -And the said DeButts doth further agree to and with the Vestry aforesaid, that in case he fails, or is by the weather prevented to preach at any of the places aforesaid, any of the times aforesaid, tobacco shall only be levied for him in proportion to his service." Mr. DeButts preached eight sermons for the parish during the year assigned him, and received 1,970 Is, of tobacco. He moved to Maryland at the end of the year.
The first Falls Church congregation to which DeButts ministered, seems to have been established through the efforts of William Gunnell. Gunnell was a native of Westmoreland County, and settled in what is now Falls Church in 1729. In that year he was issued two patents of land, one for four hundred and the other for two-hundred fifty acres, to border on Four Mile Run. A portion of this land was just north of where the church was erected. and the second on the south side of the Run, adjoining Thomas Pearson's patent on the west. In the spring of 1730. Gunnell applied to James Keith a minister of Hamilton Parish, to serve the congregation he had established in his home, consisting of Thomas Pearson, Michael Reagan, and others.
Services were held occasionally by Mr. Keith, and the congregation became known as "William Gunnell's Church." Mr. Keith served until the coming d Mr. DeButts in 1733, and received 10,544 pounds of tobacco for his services Keith was a colorful figure and was the maternal grandfather of Chief Justif John Marshall.
From 1733 (building of the first church) until 1765-69 (building of the present brick church) the history is often confusing owing to a difference of name for the church. First appearing as William Gunnell's Church," it was known after 1733 and until about 1757 as Upper Church," to distinguish it from the "Lower Church" of the parish (or "Occoquan Church," the original Pohick Church). At the time that Truro Parish was created from Hamilton Parish, the small beginnings of these two congregations
were
already in existence, as was the congregation of the "Chappell above Goose Creek," (near the Big Spring on the road to Point of Rocks outside of Lees-burg in Loudoun Count.)
The records concerning the first Falls Church, a wooden building, are given in the vestry book. On June 9, 1733, Colonel Richard Blackburn agreed with the Vestry of Truro Parish (consisting of John Sturman, Dennis McCarty.
Michael Ashford, William Godfrey, Giles Tillett, Gabriel Adams, Edward Barry, John Hereford and Edward Emms) to build this first Falls Church:
Whereas Mr. Richard Blackburn has this day agreed with this Vestry fo build a Church at the Cross roads near Michael Reagans in this Parish of the following dimentions; Vizt: Forty feet in length, two and twenty foot wide, and thirteen foot pitch, to be weather boarded.
Covered, and all the inside work perform'd and done after the same manner the work upon Oddduid Pohick Church is. done, for the sum of thirty three thousand five hundred pounds of tobacco.
William Godfrey and Michael Ashford were "to take care that the work upon the church be well and sufficiently done and performed." Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman in his George Washington (Vol. 1, page 54) gives the above quotation from the Vestry Book and states: "It is quite probable, though it cannot be stated positively, that this was the first church ever attended by George Washington."
Michael Reagan gave the land for the Falls Church, but failed to give a deed to the Vestry. He later sold his property to John Trammell. On March 20, 1746, by deed recorded in the Fairfax Court House, John Trammell transferred "by deed of bargain and sale to the Vestry of Truro Parish in Fairfax County" a certain parcel of land containing two acres "where the Upper Church now is, to be laid off in such manner as the Vestry shall think proper, to include the said Church church-yard, and spring, and all appurtenances to the said premises." Trammell received fifty shillings sterling for the land.
The name Falls Church first appears in the old Vestry Book on November 28, 1757, when John Lumley, Clerk at "Falls Church" and Alexandria was ordered paid 2,000 lbs. of tobacco for his services. Prior to this entry the church was called "Upper Church." It is interesting to note that at one time the church mav have been referred to as "Little Falls Church." Bishop Meade refers to the church by this name.?
The contract awarded on June 9, 1733 is the earliest record concerning the building at Falls Church. By order of the vestry dated October 13, 1734,
John Trammell was paid 320 pounds of tobacco for "grubbing a place for a church." Under the same date, the Vestry ordered that Richard Blackburn be paid 16,750 pounds of tobacco "for his plans for building a church." and Joseph Johnson was ordered to "read at the chapels," for which he was to receive 1,300 pounds of tobacco. By this date the new building was at least partly in use. Another building was being constructed for the church at Goose Creek, and became known as "Goose Creek Chapel." On June 10. 1733, Capt. Francis Aubrey was paid 2,500 Ibs. of tobacco for building
the chapel.
Richard Blackburn, the architect of Falls Church, was a prominent Prince William resident, and a son of Col. Thomas Blackburn, an early settler.
His daughter, Julia Anne Blackburn, married Justice Bushrod Washington, who inherited Mount Vernon from General Washington. Jane Charlotte Blackburn, niece of Julia Anne (Blackburn) Washington, married John Augustine Washington, last private owner of Mount Vernon.
Colonel Richard Blackburn is noted in the records as a "builder of skill."
He designed the original house at Mount Vernon, now part of the present mansion. The Blackburn home, Rippon Lodge, built in 1725. and named for his ancestral home in Rippon, England, still stands today in what is now Prince William County, and is owned by a descendant, Richard Blackburn Black.
Rippon Lodge is a story-and half frame building with a gabled roof and three dormer windows. The dormer windows project over the balustraded roof of a recessed porch which has six small Doric columns. In the interior. the hall and dining room have richly carved paneling. In the upper hall is an aperture in the north wall which formerly led to a secret stairway. This stairway connected with a tunnel extending from the basement to a ravine.
In the yard is a brick office which Blackburn used, and a building called the guardhouse with iron-grilled windows. In this structure Thomas Blackburn quartered soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
The Reverend Charles Green was the first resident clergyman appointed to the Falls Church and the other churches of the parish. He was settled in 1737 and served until 1764. Green is of special interest because of numerous marginal notes which he made in the Vestry Book. Dr. Green was recom mended to the Vestry by Captain Augustine Washington. The following is the Vestry Record of August 19, 1736:
At a Vestry held for Truro Parish this 19th. day of August, 1736, present: Jeremiah Bronaugh, Church Warden; Dennis McCarty, Augustine Washington, Richard Osborn, John Sturman,
Wm.
Godfrey, James Baxter, Edward Barry, and Thomas Lewis, Vestry-men. Mr. Charles Green, being recommended to this Vestry by Capt. Augustine Washington as a person qualified to officiate as a Minister of this Parish, as soon as he shall receive orders from his Grace the Bishop of London to qualify himself for the same.
It is therefore orderedby this Vestry, that as soon as the said Green
The following names are of the first Vestry of Fairfax Parish: John West, Charles Alexander, William Payne, John Dalton, George Washington, Charles Broadwater, George Johnston, Townsend Dade, Richard Sanford, William Adams, John Posey, and Daniel French. The life of the new parish after the first division was but four months.
There is no evidence that the Vestry ever met for organization. The revision of the parish boundaries having taken place in May, Washington was elected a Vestryman of Truro Parish again in July. The Falls Church and the church at Alexandria (Christ Church) fell within the bounds of the new parish, where thev remain to this day. It was left to the Vestry of Fairfax Parish to complete the new edifice at Falls Church, which was done by 1769.
Details concerning the completion of the church are found in both Vestry Books. On February 3rd and 4th, 1766, at the home of William Gardner (at which time Washington was present) the following was recorded: "It appearing from an order of the Vestry bearing date the 25th day of March 1763 that there was a deficiency in the work which ought to have been done to the Falls Church by Mr. Chas. Broadwater and that persons were appointed to view the same and report and no report appearing upon the records of this parish it is ordered that the Church Wardens do inquire into the same and report accordingly."
Again, on July 10, 1766:
"At a Vestry held for Truro Parish, July 10, 1766, Mr. Edward Payne one of the Church Wardens having reported to this vestry that he had applied to the persons formally appointed to view the work which ought to have been done on the Falls Church by Mr. Chas. Broadwater and that they denied having any order to view the same and refused to concern themselves: Or-dered: That Thos. Price do view the work done to the Falls Church and report what deficiency appears in the same and that Mr. Edward Payne do apply to the vestry of Fairfax Parish to appoint a workman to view the same and that the said do report as aforesaid and that Mr. Edward Payne attend the viewing on behalf of this parish and to apply to the said vestry to appoint one of their members to attend the same on behalf of their parish." A meeting was held at the Glebe on February 23, 1767, (at which time George Washington was present). The following was reported: "A report being made to this vestry by Jas. Wren and Thos. Price two workmen empowered by a formal order of this vestry to view the work done to the Falls Church and to report what deficiency appeared in the same etc., by which report there appears to be a deficiency of 9 £ 14 s. 6 p. Ordered: That the Church Wardens of this parish apply to Maj. Chas. Broadwater the undertaker of said work for the sum and account with the vestry of Fairfax Parish for their proportion of the same when it is received. Ordered: That a vestry house be built at the new church.

The Vestry Book of Truro Parish is particularly valuable since it contains numerous autographs of George Washington. George Mason, and others.
For further study there is an excellent manuscript volume (of which only several copies were made) having the following title page: "The Falls Church/The Old Colonial Church Near the Falls of the Potomac/1733-1940/Charles A.

The cost of building the Falls Church was £600. It was begun in 1761 and being complete. turned over to the Vestry in December, 1769. As 10 the materials used, Bishop Meade' writing during the 1850's states that the proportions of lime and sand in the mortar was the very reverse of the proportion of this day. and which accounts for the greater durability of al clent walls. The shingles were to be of the best Cypress or Juniper, and? warters of an inch thick, instead of our present half inch." Bishop Mead wrote. "A gallery never was erected in the Little Falls Church." However
the first building may have had a gallery. In 1740 three of the notables of the parsh asked permitits was to be or in lxcliste use of their families. west end of the church. This was to be for the exclusive use of their families.
The rector was one of the petitioners, though he signed "Charles Green.
Doctor of Physick."
There is a tradition that the bricks in the church walls were brought from England, and brick was often used as ballast. However, it is well known locally hat the bricks in the Falls Church were made by Colonel James Wren and William Wren, at their kiln. Although "bricks from England" is a pleasing radition, it is pointed out by numerous authorities that it is not altogether probable. Only a very few were imported by the colonies. Nearly everywhere
" Virginia can be found excellent deposits of brick clay, Thus the material was cheap and near at hand. The ships out of England were small, and every available inch of space was packed with manufactured and much-needed stems. The "bricks from England" theory in all probability came to popular thought by the fact that the trade phrases of the makers were "Dutch" and "English" style brick. The Wren kiln was about three-fourths of a mile east of what is now Dunn Loring, one block south of the W. & O.D. Railroad on Shreve Road.4
The Vestry ordered that George Washington pay to Alexander Henderson the sum of £8 being the balance of £ 9 - 14 s. 6 p. received from Maj. Chas.
Broadwater "for a deficiencv on the Falls Church." This was the conclusion of a drawn-out discussion. Washington's name appears less and less in the Vestry Book. On February 24, 1784 (in the same year that the civil functions of the Vestry ceased) it was reported: "At a vestry held for Truro Parish at Colchester the 22nd day of February 1784, John Gibson, gent., is elected for a member of this Parish in the room of his Excellency, General Washington who has signified his resignation in a letter to Dan'1. McCarty, Esq." The meeting of Fairfax Parish, held December 20, 1769, was attended by:
Townsend Dade, Church Warden; James Wren, Church Warden; William Payne, John Dalton, Charles Broadwater, Richard Sanford, William Adams, Daniel French, Edward Dulin, Thomas Shaw, and Henry Gunnell. "It is agreed by the Vestry that Mr. James Wren has completed the work on the Falls Church. agreeable to his contract and that his bond be delivered to him, and that they have received the same for the use of the parish. Ordered:
That Mr. James Wren and Townshend Dade do Allott the seats for the parishioners according to dignity. It is ordered that the old church be sold immediately and be removed by the last of February, a distance sufficient from the new building and the purchaser to give bond and security payable next June, come tweive months, and if it is not removed by that time that the Property be vested in the Parish again."
The old building which seems to have been in use right up to 1769, was sold to John Brawner for 7 pounds, 10 shillings. It stood somewhat southWest of the present building.S
The Vestry of Fairfax Parish met twenty-seven times between December
30. 1769 and March 24. 1771, and the business at hand was more or less

At the time of the First World War it was a common sight to see herd of cattle moving along the Leesburg Pike through Falls Church toward Washington. The largest slaughter house in this vicinity was at Rossi. and was conducted on a profitable basis for many years. Local farmers would arise about four o'clock in the morning, and, with four or five neighbos to help, would drive the cattle to be slaughtered. They arrived in Rossl about nine o'clock
Times have changed rapidly and all we see today to remind us of our once rural area is an occasional plow horse and wagon.
In early colonial times, the life of the colony centered around the parish church. Here the social and religious affairs of life were attended to. The location of a church was determined by a main road, and the location selecti was usuallv accessible to water. There were sometimes two or three churches in each parish, and an occasional "chapel of ease." The latter was located in a remote neighborhood and served from one of the churches. Church location was controlled by a desire to make the meeting place central. principal plantations, and the main road offered a carriage-way for the faith. ful. Once a neighborhood was selected, the exact location was determined by a good spring of water, as the parishioners came over hot and dusty roads in summer, and often man and beast refreshed themselves after traveling half the length of the county. The spring near "Big Chimneys" was convenien to the Falls Church

The name Middle Turnpike was applied becaus it lay between the Little River Turnpike, from Alexandria westward, an the Georgetown Turnpike, from Georgetown to Dranesville, where
the Georgetown Pike. It is interesting to note that the minutes of the Town Council of Falls Church, mentioned this as Middle Turnpike until that part of it within the town limits was named Broad Street. Broad Street has long been known locally as the Leesburg Pike.
Leesburg Pike (Route 7) is said to be one of the oldest roads in America in continuous use. It was originally an Indian trail about two hundred and thirty miles long, extending from Tidewater (in the vicinity of Williamsburg) to what were known as "the valleys beyond the mountains," or beyond the Blue Ridge. It passed through the counties of New Kent, King William, Caroline, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Prince William, crossing the Occoquan at Colchester into Fairfax. From Colchester it passed by way of Accotink, Washington's Old Mill, over the fords at Little Hunting Creek and at Great Hunting Creek, into Alexandria.
From Alexandria the Indian trail followed two routes, varying from one to twelve miles apart as the branches passed on their way to the mountains.
One of these passed through Fairfax County by Falls Church and Dranes-ville. through Loudoun County by Leesburg and Clark's Gap in the Catoctin Mountains and by Hillsboro to Key's Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
It was over this branch that General Sir Peter Halket's historic Forty-fourth Regiment of British Regulars, a part of General Braddock's army, marched, in April, 1755, on the disastrous expedition against the French and Indians.
The other part of this Indian trail passed from Alexandria through Fairfax one mile southwest of the present court house, through Loudoun County by Aldie near the Bull Run Mountains, to Snicker's Gap in the Blue Ridge.
A considerable extent of this branch is also known as Braddock's Road, 1 from the fact that a part of Braddock's wagon train passed over it.
It was over this road that George Washington and George William Fairfax journeyed to the Shenandoah Valley to survey the lands of Thomas, Lord Fairfax. In 1753, at the age of twenty-one, as a messenger from Governor Dinwiddie to the French Commander (with a commission of Colonel), Washington passed over it again on his route to Great Meadows.
Mr. J.O. Martin wrote of this road:
.. Dolley Madison, wife of the President, fled along this same road to Leesburg, when the British burned the White House at Washington, and over this same road was borne the body of Nellie Custis, George Washington's adopted daughter, who died in the Valley of Virginia, near Berryville, at an advanced age, and who was laid to rest at Mount Vernon." Miss Ada Walker wrote the author concerning Mrs. Madison's route:
*I was told that Dolley Madison fled over Chain Bridge, spent the night at Smoot's and went on from there to Leesburg Pike.
Leaving Langley Mrs. Madison went to Falls Church by Little Falls Road, according to a local tradition. It would seem out of the way for Mrs. Madison to have used the Little Falls Road, but it may be that this was the only road leading to the Pike that was not being searched. It is known that the old
"Big Chimneys" at Falls Church was searched by the British, since the President was thought to be there.

What is now known as Little Falls Street was once a tobacco or "Rolling Road." Little Falls Street in Falls Church was once part of the road to the Little Falls of the Potomac, and crossed the Leesburg Pike (Broad Street) about in front of the present day Odd Fellows Hall. The road meandered through the vacant field near the Bowling Alley. This road passed Big Chim-nevs Tavern, and connected with the road (Fairfax Street) beside the old Falls Church. Fairfax Street, often called "old back road," or by the more dignified "Courthouse Road," by older residents, passed, near Hillwood Avenue behind the old Birch home, connecting with Wilson Boulevard.
Great Falls Street, which intersects Little Falls Road in Falls Church, is another old road. A well-known local tradition, coming from several independent sources, maintains that George Washington surveyed this road as a route to the Potomac Canal
Shreve Road at West Falls Church follows a colonial access road which was used by the Wren, Darne, and Lindsay families. It was not until 1869, however, that it was laid off and under public control, although it was extended for public use as far as Backlick Road (now Lee Highway) below Mills Crossroads (Merrifield). Shreve Road was named for William Henry Shreve of "Mount Pleasant" (the old Lindsay home) who presented a petition to the Fairfax County Court in October, 1869: 12
Ifor] a county road from a point on the Middle Turnpike road about one fourth of a mile north of the crossing of the Alexandria Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad to a point on the road leading from Falls Church to Fairfax Court House and passing through the lands of Daniel H.

This petition was signed by William H. Shreve, J.C. DePutron, Archibald Sherwood, Seth Osborn, William H. Ellison, Charles H. Bramhall, Charles

By the recent withdrawal of the Rebel Army, Falls Church has again come into our possession, and is now the headquarters as General Smith, who commandsone division of our army. On the advance of the National troops on the 29th of September, an un. fortunate collision took place between Baker's California regiment and Baxter's Pennsylvanians, each regiment mistaking the other an enemies. The error was not discovered until several volleys
had been fired, and many killed and wounded.

PANORAMIC VIEW OF FALLS CHURCH AND THE SUR
ROUNDING SCENERY
Munson's Hill, which was occupied by the rebels in their recent advance, and imperfectly fortified by them, is now held by the National troops, who are engaged in entrenching it in a formidable manner. It commands a wide view to the southwest in the direction of Manassas, including Mason's Hill. the Village of Falls Church, and many other points which the events of the war have made famous.
The evacuation of Munson's Hill was an event of considerable importance to the U.S. Government. This can be seen in a letter written by a corres pondent to the Washington Star, dated from Munson's Hill, September 29, 1861 and appearing in that newspaper on the following day:
Your correspondent came up to this famous locality this afternoon, and found things much changed since his last visit, when the pickets on either side were industriously popping rifle-ball courtesies and sailets tons k cover in the corn fields. between this place. and Bailey's Cross Roads, three quarters of a mile distant. the road (Leesburg Turnpike) leading to the hill was lined with visitors in carriages, on horse-back, and on foot, pushing boldly along to get a close look at the much talked of eminence. Among the visitors just leaving as I arrived was Secretary Seward.
The New York Thirty-seventh regiment was in occupancy of the hill-at least such portion of the regiment as was not straggling or unis tee meishborhood committing depredations. The deeds
54
of this regiment (formerly MeCunn's) done on yesterday will
doubtless receive an investigation at the hands of Gen. McClel-lan. They were certainly of the most disgraceful character. Several dwellings, with barns and outhouses, were set on fire and wholly consumed. Amongst these was the house and barn of Rev.
Mr. Lipscomb. Valuable furniture, pianos, large mirrors, feather beds, etc., were destroyed wantonly, and in one instance the officer of a cavalry regiment was so much incensed by these outrageous acts of vandalism that he compelled the miscreants to suspend their villanous (sic) work at the point of the pistol.
This (Thirty-seventh) Regiment will need some active discipline to make it any credit to the service. On yesterday Lieut. Col.
Burke found it necessary to shoot private William Moran through the head for insubordination. The men of the regiment were murmuring their discontent at this prompt punishment, into the ear of every visitor, and were not at all loth to use such phrases as that poor Moran was murdered for doing nothing at all.
Later in the day I saw an officer (a captain) of this regiment endeavor to raise a squad, first by entreaty, next by imperative orders. to go with him to put a stop to the depredations of their comrades.
Three or four of them finally obeyed with a very bad grace, and the inquiry, having previously passed among them, "Shall we go?" The "fort" on Munson's Hill I find to be perhaps 300 yards long in the circuit of its parapet, the whole being nothing more than infantry breast-works. having however a rather formidable "Quaker Gun," in the shape of an ash log with a dab of black paint at the butt to represent the muzzle. Such other and more valuable guns as they mav have had here had been carefully removed by the Confeds ; when they withdrew their pickets previously. At the earth-work to the rear of Munson's Hill the retreating Confederates had left six sections of stove-pipe mounted in the six embrasures, and some rather formidable looking (at a distance) earthworks upon Mason's Hill proved, on the occupation of that point by our troops, to be just about of the same bogus nature.
The stars and stripes which have displaced the "stars and bars" here, now float from a small pine tree nearly upon the apex of the hill. There is a quantity of straw on the westerly slope of the hill, but nothing to indicate that the enemy has ever been here in any force.
The bivouac fires of our troops can now be seen two or three miles in advance of this point towards the enemy's House. The Garibaldi Regiment is bivouacked at Bailey's Cross Roads, and the New York 8th (German Regiment) by the Arlington Mills.

SCOUTING PARTY NEAR FALLS CHURCH
These evervday incidents in war are generally so similar in detail as to be monotonous in the description. although in reality few things send the blood with a livelier gallop through the heart then to accompany one of them, either as artist or Special Correspondent The value of life is never so palpable as when the next step may bring us upon the muzzle of a rifle. or a hand to hand encounter with a desperate son of the south. The annexed sketch represents a small party of cavalry scouting in the vicinity of Falls Church. the scene of the late unhappy skirmish, where nearly 30 of our gallant men were either captured or slain. We are glad to learn That General McClellan contemplates issuing an order forbidding these private ventures into the Fox's den. If a correct list were drawn up of all who have been murdered in these imbecile rushes into danger. the community would be horrified at the extent of
the losses.
Of the many tales which have been handed down to this day, the most interesting is that of a humorous capture in an old chestnut tree, first told the author by the late Willis L. Gordon. Mr. Gordon said that the story was told him by Frank Williams, one of Mosby's men. He stated that the old tree was located on the road to Falls Church near the old Merry home just beyond the Dunn Loring Road, near the present day Providence Baptist Church.
The author did not think he would find documentation for this story, but Leslies gave the following account in their issue of October 26. 1861 at page 353. under a drawing by the artist in the field in the paragraph:
A REBEL TREED

The following appears separately:
TREEING A REBEL NEAR FAIRFAX
Our artist has sent us so amusing an account of the capture of Lieutenant H.J. Segal of the Confederate army, that we regret we can only epitomise the particulars. On Friday the 4th of OC tober, a scouting party of 18 men under Lieutenant Colonel B.
Winslow and Captain L.B. Shattuck, of the 37th Regiment N.Y. V. were out in the vicinity of the enemy's lines about five miles
Falls Church, in the direction of Fairfax. As they were proceeding in silence and caution through a dense wood, they heard the tramp of horses and the jingle of sabre scabbards. The Lieutenant Colonel and the Captain ordering their men to halt went to re-connoitre. In a short time one of them came upon an open space where they saw four rebels seated under a large chestnut tree. by the side of the road, and engaged in eating chestnuts. The Confederates saw him and sprang upon their horses. The officer crying in a loud voice "Charge!" by the time the scouting party had got up the four "Gallant" horsemen were beyond pursuit The men were about gathering up the spoils of the Victory, which consisted of four sabres, two revolvers, four coats and blankets. when they saw a horse tied to a tree by the roadside. A further search revealed its master perched upon the lower limb of a large chestnut--whither he had climbed with his sabre to lop off the fruit. A dozen rifles pointed at his breast soon brought him to reason, and he surrendered himself a prisoner. When he got down and felt safe, he began to 'blow with true Southern chivalry; and, when brought before General McDowell, cooly boasted that at the battle of Bull Run he had aimed repeatedly at the General. but had always missed. General McDowell smiled, and said that he would send him somewhere where he would not have another
chance for some time.
Mr. Gordon said that in the early part of this present century he and his wife were riding in their carriage up the pike during a hard storm which had come up after they had left their home. They passed the Dunn Loring Road, and decided to pause under the tree until the worst seemed over.
The great branches of the old tree crossed the road, and offered ample pro-tection. As they pulled away, (having gone about fifty feet), a bolt of lightning split the ancient landmark into pieces
The following article concerning Munson's Hill is taken from page 292
of Leslie's for September 21, 1861
MUNSON'S HILL, NEAR WASHINGTON
During the last few weeks, Munson's Hill, a prominence about five miles from Chain Bridge. has become a spot to which all eyes have been directed. It is on the northern side of the Lees-burg turnpike, about one mile from Bailey's Cross-roads, where our pickets are stationed, and about three miles this side of Falls Church. which is in full possession of the enemy. It commands no road excepting the Leesburg turnpike, the Columbia turnpike being sheltered by thick woods up to the crossing. Its defenses are unimportant, being simple breastworks of considerable extent, but not ditched, and not embrasured for artillery. Those who saw the deserted works at Fairfax Court House and Centerville will understand just how little these are worth, for they are of exactly the same order. The elevation of the hill is not great, and its summit can be approached to within a few hundred yards from the

From the four mile Run the rebel outposts cross directly to Munson's Hill, on the slope of which they descend to within a half mile of Bailey's Roads. From this point down to Benton's Tavern they hold the Columbia turnpike, and thence stretch across in almost a straight line to near the mouth of Occotink Run, the last place at which our pickets meet them.
The following is a copy of the report of Colonel J.E.B. Stuart to Genera Longstreet:
Headquarters, Munson's Hill, August 28, 1861.
General:
I inclose a list of killed and wounded (1 killed and 6 wounded).
I have no time for a detailed report on the affair of yesterday. but I acquainted Rev. D. Ball, chaplain of my regiment, as well as Major Skinner, with all the particulars, and requested them to inform you last night, which I hope will answer for present. As soon as it was fair light this morning I had a piece of rifled cannon.
Washington Battery (Artillery), brought clandestinely in position to bear on Bailey's Cross-Roads and fired four shots. distance being by the shots 1,350 yards. The shots took effect admirably, dispersing the entire force at that point, and developed what it was my object to ascertain- that they had no artillery there. Mun-son's Fill is a fine place for a battery, and is more capable of defense than Mason's Hill. The fire of artillery dispersed also a long line of skirmishers, who ran precipitately without being in the slightest danger from its shots. The 1st Regiment is at Falls Church. and I have directed its commander to hold himself in readiness to move up to my support, or act to the left as circumstances indicate. Two companies of that regiment are ordered to occupy the ridge along Upton's. I sent back Beckman's section of artil-lery, as the men were pretty well used up from fatigue and hunger. and I am now going to send back to Mason's Hill Major Johnson's command, and relieve those companies of your command here. who have been out so long, and send them back to Falls Church.
I believe this a fine line teetense: mean the line passing through is and Mason's Hill. Every inch of the road is visible from here tIBailey's Cross Roads. The force now here and at Falls Church consider sufficient for the present. and the best school of prac-lice possible for our troops. I consider the enemy's design not I meet us outside their trenches in force pretty well developed.
Please send this to General Johnston for me.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant.
J.E.B. Stuart, Colonel, Commanding.
J. Longstreet. Brigadier-General.
ps. The scattered fragments of the force at Bailey's Cross-roads reassembled, and I have the place in position to stir them up again whenever the group is in sufficient force to warrant the expenditure of our ammunition.
J.E. B.S.
In the September 28. 1861 issue of Leslie's at page 310, is an item concerning the defenses at Bailey's Crossroads and at Munson's Hill. The picture. at page 311. is entitled: "Bailey's Cross Roads. Virginia- the advanced posts of the Federal Pickets, Munson's Hill one mile in the distance_-from a sketch by our special artist with General McClellan's command." The article follows:
BAILEY'S CROSS ROADS AND MUNSON'S HILL
Court House and the Leesburg turnpike, about five miles to the South-West of Long Bridge. It is evidently regarded by General McClellan as important strategically, and has been held by him with great tenacity. Never of high architectual pretensions, the few buildings that remain show the dilapidation and ruin incident of war, and make the place less attractive than before. It is but about a mile from the rebel position on Munson's Hill, which is in full view
During the summer of 1862, incidental to the recapture of Munson's Fill, there was an engagement and bombardment. The affair began at the Union position at Fort Head (Tyson's Cross Roads). The residents of Falls Church were forced to flee for safety. As Wadsworth's shells fell around the old colonial church, the citizens. in carts and on foot, fled to the Dulany farm, later the home of Silas Tripp, now Greenway Downs. Here they were forced to remain several weeks. Troops in the abandoned Village turned pigs out, forced their way into dwellings, and ruined gardens. Several citizens took their cows with them to Dulany's, and the milk spoiled because of the lack of means to keep it cool. They cooked on an old cookstove with the help of an ancient colored servant of Mr. Dulany. The men put the stove out in the pasture, and it was in use all day.

GRAND REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL ARMY AT WASH.
INGTON. SEVENTY THOUSAND MEN ON THE FIELD.
The review held by General McClellan on Wednesday, the 20th of November, presented a spectacle never witnessed on this side of the Atlantic, for on that day nearly 70,00 patriot soldiers stood in arms ready to meet the enemies of their country, who combine the two-fold characters of rebels and brothers.
The spot chosen for the review was the open plain adjoining
Bailey's Cross Roads, and the adjacent hills, Mason's and Munson' We have described and illustrated these localities so often that we shall content ourselves by adding that Bailey's Cross Roads are situated eight miles from '
Washington, in the direction of Fair-
fax Court House, at the junction of the Columbia turnpike and the Alexandria and Leesburg turnpike. Between the Cross Roads and Munson's Hill, a mile and a half distant towards Falls Church, is a plain two miles in length, which was prepared by clearing off the fences, filling up the ditches, etc., for this grand display.
At half-past nine o'clock the General commanding, attended by all his staff officers, left his headquarters, escorted by a column of 18.000 regular cavalry. The array was most imposing as this splendid cortege moved through the streets, the cavalry marching by platoons until it reached the bridge, where it was compelled to march by columns of four, and afterwards defiled along the road leading by Arlington Heights to the review ground.
McClellan was plainly attired. As he rode in advance of his numerous retinue he was loudly cheered.
In the upper and lower divisions, Gen. McCall's and Gen Heintzelman's from which a march ofsome eightor ten miles had to be made, the troops were astir at from two to three o'clock in the morning, and were on the march long before daylight. All of the seven divisions on the Virginia side of the Potomac were represented in the review, but enough were left in each to supply double the usual picket force to guard the camps, and a reserve in addition strong enough to repel any attack in force the enemy could make.
As early as nine o'clock the head of the column of Gen. Blenker's
division the headquarters of which are nearest to Bailey's began to arrive at the grounds from the Washington road. Soon after den. McDowell's advance guard appeared on a road entering the grounds from the same direction, but farther to the west. Next time the head of Gen. Franklin's column, approaching from the Alexandria road; and soon after the division o
Gen. Smith began
to enter the grounds from the direction of Falls Church. Gen.
Fitz John Porter was next on the ground, bringing his forces by still another road. The troops now poured in from all directions. those under Gen. Heintzelman following Gen. Franklin's division, and the column of Gen. McCall succeeding that of Gen. Smith, and continued without cessation until half-past eleven o'clock.
The scene now was most exhilarating more than 20 Generals, with their staffs, numbering above 150 horsemen, were dashing hither and thither arranging their divisions which presented a total of above 70,000 men, including seven regiments of cavalry. numbering nearly 8,000 men.
At a quarter past 11 o'clock the President of the United States entered the grounds in his carriage, followed by the Secretary of State, also in his carriage, and by the Secretary of War and Post-Master General, accompanied by Mrs. General McDowell and by two daughters of General Taylor on Horseback. The party were escorted to a slight elevation near the centre of the area, marked by a white flag, where they were soon joined by General McClellan and his staff. The cavalry escort was formed in line on the left. The seven regiments of volunteer cavalry, and the entire artillery present, were placed on the outer margin of the grounds. The infantry were formed into columns by divisions in
ignated for that purpose.
In the meantime the President and Secretary of State, Secretary of War and Assistant Secretary of War, alighted from their carriages, mounted horses and prepared to accompany General McClellan in his review of the lines. This occupied about an hour and a half. Then commenced the march of the troops past in review. The honor of leading the column was assigned the First Rifle Regiment of Pennsylvania Reserve, or the Bucktails, which was with General McClellan in Western Virginia. The divisions then passed in the following order:
First-General McCall's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Mead, Reynolds. and Ord Second--General Heintzelman's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Sedgwick, Jamison and Richardson.
Third--General Smith's division, composed of the brigades of Generals Hancock, Brooks, and Benham.
Water was scarce during 1898 because of the large numbers of troops stationed here. The Army hauled water from Washington in large white. painted barrels and one of them was placed in front of Mankin's Notions & Dry Goods Store.
Soldiers stood guard around the clock to prevent anyone from poisoning the water. Many wells were sunk at Dunn Loring, where the troops came by train, if they did not get off at East Falls Church. They also had a post at Dunn Loring.
The little red brick Post Office building (now a cleaning establishment) was built several years prior to the war by Mr. Charles E. Mankin. During the war it was found necessary to enlarge the building because of the volume of mail coming to Camp Alger, and the back wing was added.
When the troops were recalled at the close of the war, Falls Church quieted down to a more normal pace, but was for the first time what one writer called
"cosmopolitan Falls Church." Many local girls married soldiers, and ties were made with other states. The village of Falls Church lingers today in the memories of former Camp Alger soldiers. Typical of these is Congressman Barrett O'Hara (R) of Illinois, who called on this author for information concerning the location of the camp, as it was the first time he had made a trip here in many years.
At Camp Alger was the home of a fine Negro, fondly called "Ike." Isaac Norment was a graduate of Oberlin College, as was his wife. During the war they opened their home to General Butler, and it served as his headquarters.
The Village of Falls Church in 1892
The following account of Falls Church as it appeared in 1892 is taken from the unpublished autobiography of the late Charles A. Stewart.)
...My wife and I first went to Falls Church in Sept. 1892 and lived there about a year, making some very pleasant acquaintances and a few friends that ever after remained faithful. It was in the summer of 1894 that I built a six-room cottage at East End, as it was then called, and became from the fall of that year a permanent resident of the town. The town of Falls Church at that time had about 1,100 inhabitants and the only means of transportation to Washington except by horse back or horse drawn vehicle, was by the steam cars on a branch of the Southern Railway extending from the junction with the main of the R.F. & P.R.R. near Alexandria to Round Hill at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

East Broad Street). In his book, Crusade in Europe, on page 24, President Eisenhower mentions the house as the house he had not seen in the dav-light. Ann C. Whitman, Personal Secretary to the President on April 4, 1955, stated in a letter to the author
The President spent some time in Dr. Milton Eisenhower's home in Falls Church during 1941. It was a particularly hectic period in the President's life, and he does not recall many of the details of his existence, outside of the strenuous and long working hours.
After 1917 Falls Church lost most of its small town character and reached City status at the close of World War Two. It is difficult to give an adequate description of Falls Church prior to 1917, and after 1898. Here is an account written in 1907:

The earliest known stopping place on the mail route in Falls Church was
Mt. Hope the old Coe-Duncan house on Oak Street near West Broad sweet. Af this same time the Big Chimneys Tavern was a stopping pace for mail riders. The Post Office at Falls Church after 1850 was in the see Tavern. The first Post Master at Falls Church, Charles Upton, of "Upas Hill," was appointed by the President on June 11, 1849.
Charles Horace Upton was a native of Salem, Mass., and a graduate o Bowdoin College. He came to Falls Church in 1837 and engaged in" cultural and literary pursuits." He was Post Master for eleven days! The second Post Master, Dr. Simon J. Groot, was an early physician in Fals Church. Upton continued to live near Falls Church, and in 1861 was electer as the first Republican representative to Congress from Virginia. He later was Consul General to Switzerland, and died in 1877.
The Falls Church Post Office served about one hundred twentv-five families in its infancy. This service was later expanded to meet the need of a growing community. At about the same time as the Johnstown Flood the Potomac River rose, and mail delivery was interrupted. A group of Falls Church men, in cluding M.E. Church, J.W. Brown, Eli Northrup and Post Master, Chats
E. Mankin, took turns in rowing the flooded Potomac for the mail bag.

Friends and Neighbors
At the Fireside *
There was a special place at the fireside for Mammy. She was an insin tion: life did not function without her. In the corner by the fire. in the bs spot, was Mammy's chair. Here in slave times she nursed her "white ai dren," gave them a growing philosophy of life, and prepared them for the place in society a place she usually determined.
The Negro Mammy of yesterday was a basic influence on the everyda life of Falls Church, She held a respected place in the family, and her word was law. Usually a woman of superior intelligence and character, Mamm was chief among the servants (they were called slaves in legal documents!
When "Big Chimneys" was dismantled during the early 1900's. the bids from the huge end chimneys were purchased by the Tinners and used in new Negro homes. These new chimneys were smaller, but the bricks were
"at home" close to people whose forebears were part of the "Big Chim neys" fireside of other days.
Mammy at the fireside, best friend of the household, following the War Between the States became a neighbor at the fireside. The role of slave master was changed, but the ties of affection and friendship, could not be easily severed.

The community of yesterday, as well as the city of today, would not have its full chators have had a vital fore in ties Negro citizens: For these leave and neishbors have at Fais al role in the on going of Falls Chtrese The Negro people of Falls Church have always been, as a whole, a responsible citizenry. Many intelligent Negroes. former slaves. aided in the despon-Silustment following the War Between the States. They were always part af the community. even in slave times, and continued to build in the new society. One reason for the outstanding contribution of our Negro citizens was the close relationship between them and their white families. This is indicated in a deposition made by John R. Minor, of Minor's Hill, age 80
years, on January 5, 1895:1
Up until the late war, when the Negroes were freed, white women and children especially used to often stay at the house of Negroes over night, and sometimes for several days and nights. The Ne groes were generally their old servants, or well known to the fam-ilv. The children were often left with them for several days and nights at a time, especially with their old mammys, and some. times when children would get out with their parents they would

I remember old Frederick Foote was thought a great deal of by the white people and so was his wife, and children used to very frequently go to their house and stay all night. When he belonged to my uncle, Major Phil Minor, he had the entire charge of my uncle's place for months at a time. My uncle had a very fine place in the country (at Falls Church) but spent most of his time in the City of Washington, and as Fred was a very trusty and reliable servant, he left him in charge of everything. A great many white people used to go there when Fred and his family were there by them-selves. The custom prevailed up until the late war.
This old-time Falls Church resident introduces us to some of the best known early citizens of the Negro community. Frederick Forrest Foote, Jr. as a member of the Town Council from his appointment, August 1, 1881, until his death in 1889! He urved for a time as Secretary of the Council His life history is full of interest, and a present day relative, Dr.
Edwin B. Henderson, has a now der rosh wich prame down through the Foote family, once highly prized by Mr. Foote. Dr. Henderson wrote an interesting story about thy poized by Me rote.

V what is now 7 Comers, M. REconte was twice married. By his list one adeline. Manuel. he had issue: Rachel Foote Clay. (who had children Waite Duty. Joseph Clay and Caesar Clay): Ellen Foote Weston, Margaret Asgie Packson, Harriet Foote Maddox, William Foote, and Frederick Foodte Jacole.

St. Ifather of Frederick Kenneth Foote who married Mamie Boyd): Forrest Foote of Linglestown, Pennsylvania (who was father of Frank and Mar garet Foote); and Joseph S. Foote.
Following the Emancipation Proclamation, Frederick Foote joined the Union Army, and later received a pension. By action of the 48th Congress (Bill S.1494) relief in the amount of $1095.00 was granted Mr. Foote for supplies taken from his farm for use by the Union Army. This bill was introduced February 11, 1884. He worked for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on the night-shift to earn money to purchase his farm. In 1864 he purchased 33.5 acres of land at what is now 7 Corners Shopping Center for 500.00.
He enlarged this to forty acres, selling some late in life. By his Will, Mr.
Foote directed that the land never be sold, but must remain in the Foote family. When taxes got out of proportion, his children, Margaret Jackson.
Virginia Jackson, and Frank Foote, during the 1950's, obtained release from the Will by a law suit. They sold the land for $750,000, and the 7 Corners Shopping Center was erected on it.
Frederick Forrest Foote. (called Senior), was a son of the older Frederick Foote mentioned in the depositions. When he died in 1889, the Town Coun all passed a resolution of honor, had it engrossed for the family, and members of the Council served as pall-bearers. Mr. Foote was not only community-minded, but owned a large grocery and provisions store on the corner of Broad and South Washington Streets (later site of Kents Cleaners). Mr.
Foote was also a long-time shoemaker in Falls Church.
Mr. Foote's wife, Mary F. Foote, died in 1928. Their two children, Fred,
J. lactually the third of chat nanoel, and his sister, Constance (called Connie) never married. Miss Constance Foote, who died in 1946, was an artist any. several paintings of Falls Church of other days show remarkable accuracy.

He was a life-long Republican and voted each year with the exception of one year.
Mr. Foote was never affiliated with any church, and it was well known in the community that he would not lie, and kept his word. He did not smoke. drink or gamble. In later years he was a strong supporter of civil rights causes and was for many years a member of the NAACP.
Another well-known Negro family were the Coates. Old John Minor re called Charles Coates, ancestor of all by that name in Falls Church:
I knew Charles Coates very well. He died about 3 years ago: was about 100 years old when he died; he was always considered a perfectly truthful man, and a man of excellent character. He had a most remarkable memory, and good mental faculties. have often heard him tell of incidents that occurred during the War of 1812, and even before that time. A man bv the name of Lewis, who was my father's body servant during the War of 1812, was very intimate with Coates. I have also heard Lewis tell of incidents thatoccurred during the War of 1812.

Henry and Julia Rector, husband and wife, were well-known members of this family. During ante-bellum days they were slaves of prominent fam-lies: one belonged to the Randolphs, the other to the Magills.
Aunt Fanny Robinson was a practical nurse and midwife who delivered several generations of local children. She lived with her husband, Mitchel Robinson (who, for some reason, was never called uncle), at Merrifield.
Mr. Robinson farmed for Judge Riley. Mrs. Charles E. Gage recalls that Aunt Fanny was tall and thin, with gray hair, parted in the middle. She had a sweet and gentle voice, and was greatly loved. Her husband was good and honest.! The last baby delivered by Aunt Fanny was the late Brooks Oden.
Aunt Caroline Kerfert |Kerfoot| was another trusted and beloved citizen.
A former slave, Aunt Caroline worked for most of the better known citizens of Falls Church. She was a good worker and particular about the families who hired her. She was an employee of Mrs. William H.G. Lynch for many years. Aunt Caroline never married, and it is thought she had no relatives in this country. As one old resident put it, her many friends made up for the lack of them. It is difficult to piece together the story of her long life. She was said to be the daughter of an African Chief, and brought to this country before the War Between the States. During her life-time, Aunt Caroline practiced her "religion," that of voodoo, spirit worship and animism. She arose with the sun, to worship, and also had a ritual for the sunset and full moon. If a rainbow or full moon appeared. Aunt Caroline put on a fresh white apron, and would go into the middle of Broad Street for her "spirit-uals." Swinging a small silver pail over her head, she would sing and chant womething that sounded like: "Hello Mr. Dave. hello Mr. Will.* Her spirit worship did not prevent her regular attendance at the Methodist Church.

I was born a slave in 1848 on the plantation of Cook Fitzhugh.
The plantation consisted of more than 2,000 acres and borders on the limits of the magisterial district of the present Falls Church. I have seen as many as 150 slaves assembled on the place at one time. Neighboring plantations were owned by the Dulins, and other Fitzhughs.
During the war and just before, the slaves were allowed to attend services in the rear of the old Episcopal Church at Falls Church and we occasionally heard preaching by some Negro who had been permitted to preach. Before the war there was quite a belief in the power of magic and hoodooism or voo-dooism. I have been taken by my mother to visit the practitioners of this art to find out things my mother wanted to know. Even today there are some people about here who believe in the power of magic. One of the Negro preachers who traveled in my day before the war was a man named Hawley.
Shortly after the war began, a man named Reed, who lived on the present site of the Virginia Home for feeble minded persons. taught school for the benefit of many of the Negroes who would come to his home. He also taught Bible lessons at a Sunday School. He was Captain of the Home Guards. One night Mosby's men came into town and because of Reed's relations to Negroes. took him out into the pines about the house and shot him and two other men who lived with him.
In 1865 Thomas Green and "Bill' Stuart came into the town after service in the Army and began to hold prayer meetings along with George Rumbles, and Nathan Rumbles. The first two men were Baptist, and the others Methodist.
At an old house on what is now the "Pickett" Place, the four would meet with ex-slaves from the plantations and elsewhere and hold prayer meeting nearly every night. These meetings were held durina yet meeting near-4 S. shortly afterwards the col ored people were given an old log house which was moved piece by piece from a site near the present railroad and put on the land now belonging to Mr. William Henderson. Two rooms whe built for the two white women who came into town from the north to teach Negroes. This old log building located on the way road was used as a freedmen's camp for slaves who ran away during the war. The land now owned by Mr. Henderson the shopping center, including the Hobby Shop adjacent to the Falls Church in i gb4 belonged in those days to the Rev. kiried Reed, a white man, then living where his relatives had been kind by Mosby's men. henen iving er with the colored people in one of these rooms and exhort with them. It was here that the bap üist Church was planned and organized.

## Historical Context
This work contributes to our understanding of Falls Church not just as a geographical or political entity, but as a living community composed of families and individuals. The "fence and fireside" approach captures both the public interactions between neighbors (the fence) and the private family life (the fireside) that together create the fabric of a community. This social history perspective complements the more formal political and infrastructure-focused histories of the city.
