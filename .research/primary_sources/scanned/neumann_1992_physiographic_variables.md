# The Physiographic Variables Associated with Prehistoric Site Location in the Upper Potomac River Basin, West Virginia

## Thomas W. Neumann

Frequency distributions, covariance matrices, and cluster analyses were used to isolate the physiographic variables associated with the location of prehistoric archaeological sites in the South Branch of the Potomac River drainage basin. Analyses considered overall prehistoric patterns, as well as the patterns associated with each cultural-historical manifestation. Results indicate that 95.2% of sites with prehistoric materials were on surfaces with slopes of 10% or less. Results also indicate that 85.3% of the sites were 100 m or less from a stream with a flow rate of at least 12 cfs, while 94.8% were 200 m or less from such a stream.

Cluster analysis found that Early and Middle Archaic-bearing sites consisted of small, upper drainage/higher elevation sites and of large, lower drainage/lower elevation sites. Late Archaic and Early Woodland sites also consisted of these two types of sites, as well as a third set of sites with southwesterly or northwesterly orientations. Four site types were isolated for Middle Woodland-bearing sites; these included two sets of larger, lower elevation sites first occupied or re-occupied by Middle Woodland peoples, a third set of small sites with a northwesterly orientation, and an upland set. Three site types were isolated for Late Woodland-bearing sites. Two distinct site clusters existed among sites lacking diagnostics. The first set represented higher elevation sites; the second consisted of lower elevation sites. Various models and postulates regarding prehistoric site location in the Middle Atlantic also were reviewed.

## INTRODUCTION

There are two ways to approach the location of prehistoric archaeological sites. The first is to reconstruct the operational model used by the cultural participants to select site locations. This procedure requires a knowledge of the cultural factors that influenced prehistoric peoples and their movement over the landscape. The resultant adumbration of settlement rules depends in part upon correct ascription of site function; such exercises also are demonstrative but non-expansive. Examples of this first approach in the Middle Atlantic would be those models presented by Gardner (1982, 1983, 1987, 1989) and his students (e.g., Custer 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1990; Stewart 1982, 1987, 1989; Stewart et al. 1986), as well as by Brashler and Lesser (Brashler and Lesser 1990; Brashler et al. 1987; Lesser 1988; Lesser and Brashler 1987).

The second approach to understanding the location of prehistoric archaeological sites is to take all of the geographic parameters known about such sites, then to tease out the patterns associated with prehistoric site distribution. Such an approach is inductive; it is expansive but non-demonstrative. It does not require an operational model of the values held by the prehistoric peoples that influenced their choice of site location, but neither does such an approach address questions about cultural behavior. Examples of this second approach in the Middle Atlantic would be Kavanagh's (1982) consideration of site location in the Monocacy basin, and Hay et al.'s (1987) consideration of Clemson Island site location.

To say that either approach is independent of the other would be false. A behavior-based model must have some image of the arrangement of sites on the landscape, while any image of the actual arrangement invites comparison with previously developed models. However, while each approach has advantages, those advantages depend upon the status and the needs of the archaeology practiced in the given area. For the drainage basin of the South Branch of the Potomac River, where comparatively less behaviorally oriented research has been done, the second, inductive approach appears to be better. Approaching site distribution in this fashion can also result in a management tool that quickly identifies areas that have a high probability of containing prehistoric archaeological sites.

The following discussion is meant primarily to summarize the physiographic variables associated with prehistoric site location in the South Branch of the Potomac River basin. Although the results permit evaluating some hypotheses and propositions about prehistoric site location implicit in settlement models for the Middle Atlantic and for the Upper Ohio Valley, such evaluation is a secondary concern.

The discussion is organized in the following way. First, the methods and parameters used will be given. Next, the patterns for prehistoric site locations, first for all known or suspected prehistoric sites, then for those sites with known cultural-historical affiliations, will be given. Last, these results will be compared with the expectations of some of the site location models that have been applied to eastern West Virginia and adjacent areas. This last exercise is meant to see how applicable such models are to what is known so far about site distribution in the basin.

## METHODS

Information on sites located in the drainage basin of the South Branch of the Potomac River (Figure 1) came from the site files at the Department of Culture and History, Charleston, West Virginia, specifically the files for Hampshire, Hardy, Grant, and Pendleton counties. The South Branch basin had 277 numbered archaeological sites when records were examined in the summer of 1991. Of those 277 archaeological sites, 10 sites were designated as Historic only. While 89 of the site forms did not record any cultural-historical affiliation, sufficient ancillary information was present such that 27 of those sites could be considered "Prehistoric" without prejudicing the sample. Thus, the total sample consisted of 205 prehistoric or suspected prehistoric sites.

The site files record information on individual site forms and on 7.5 minute USGS topographic maps. Where available, the research reports generated by cultural resources surveys were used to provide information not recorded or specified in the first two sets. Generally, the USGS maps provided information on site size, elevation above nearest and next-nearest stream, confluences, watershed area, stream elevation, floodplain width, site exposure, distance to nearest and next-nearest stream, and site orientation and exposure. Individual site forms provided information on slope and prehistoric cultural affiliation. If such information was lacking on the individual forms, then the apposite cultural resources report was used. Three reports (Boedy 1984; Cunningham and Barse 1979; Stewart and Bowers 1989) provided cultural-historical affiliations for 132 of the prehistoric sites. If the missing information could not be determined from the report, then the slope was estimated from surface trends on the USGS map, while cultural-historical affiliation was left unspecified.

An estimate was made of stream flow rates for the two streams nearest to each site. This figure was expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs; ft³/sec); figures for each stream were computed as follows. Watershed boundaries and areas were derived from Hobba et al. (1972); the average minimum flow for 274 days, as recorded in 1966, was taken for the five recording stations in the South Branch basin (Balock et al. 1971). The average minimum flow rate over 274 days was the longest period tabulated by Balock et al. (1971) for each gauging station. This was seen as a suitable measurement since it would represent the average minimum amount of water in the stream for nearly a year. The year 1966 was chosen since the recorded flow values in that year were closer to the average for each recording station, and because using the same year for the entire basin would aid in comparisons.

The flow rate for each area was based on the following regression:

cfs = 0.48 (watershed area) + 11.57

where cfs was the lowest average flow rate in ft³/second over 274 days, and watershed was expressed in square miles. The lowest possible value would be around 12 cfs; this is an arithmetic foible of the regression. In 11 cases, both the nearest and second-nearest streams were assigned a flow rate of 3 cfs, based upon the apparent small size of the stream in question. This was done to compensate for the regression problem.

The median compass orientation for the site usually was taken as the downslope orientation of the minor axis of the site; most of the sites could be approximated by an ellipse. Total exposure for the site was based upon height of the surrounding hills, the extent to which those hills circumscribed the site, and the distance of the site from the hills.

## Data Limitations and Assumptions

Bloemker (1989:42) found that 25-50% of the West Virginia site forms did not record cultural affiliation. Research for this study found that 89 (32.1%) of the 277 sites designated for the South Branch basin lacked cultural-historical information. For those sites where some kind of cultural-historical designation had been made, it was assumed that the designation was correct. Fortunately, the majority of the cultural-historical ascriptions had been made by a small number of individuals (Boedy 1984; Cunningham and Barse 1979; Stewart and Bowers 1989), most of whom shared a common intellectual

A large number of the prehistoric archaeological sites listed for the South Branch basin lacked diagnostic artifacts and cultural-historical affiliations. These sites sorted into two types. The first type were lower elevation sites located on wide floodplains; half were not associated with a stream confluence. The second type were higher elevation sites located in the upper parts of the drainage; over 80% of these were associated with confluences. Both of these types of culturally undesignated sites probably represented limited activity, resource extraction sites. By implication, the sites would have had a high proportion of flakage. It is probable that most of the flakes recovered from these sites represent spent parts of a microlithic compound tool industry, or the flakes generated to replace elements lost from compound tools through use; however, most of these sites were examined before the existence of a microlithic compound tool industry was suspected.

## CONCLUSION

An analysis of the physiographic variables associated with the location of prehistoric sites in the drainage basin of the South Branch of the Potomac River found that distance from the nearest stream, combined with slope, was most strongly associated with site location. The results indicated that 85.3% of all such sites were 100 m or less from a stream with a flow rate of at least 12 cfs; 95.2% of all such sites were located on surfaces with slopes of 10% or less. For 60.4% of the prehistoric sites, there was a second stream located 200 m or less from the site; in 75.3% of all cases, the second stream came closest to the site at its point of confluence with the nearest stream.

Cluster analysis isolated two site types for Early Archaic-bearing and Middle Archaic-bearing sites. The first type consisted of smaller, higher elevation sites located in the upper parts of the basin. The second type consisted of larger sites located at lower elevations, generally in the lower reaches of the basin. It is possible that this pattern represented a seasonal transhumance, with the sites in the upper basin representing warm season camps, and with the sites in the lower basin representing cold season camps. Unlike other areas in the Middle Atlantic, the data did not reveal a change between Early and Middle Archaic use of upland and lowland sites.

Cluster analysis identified three sites types for Late Archaic-bearing and Early Woodland-bearing sites. The first type consisted of higher elevation sites located along smaller streams; the second consisted of floodplain sites set along larger streams, but with the second closest stream being the same size as that associated with the upland sites. These sites appear to be consistent with the base camp - transient camp hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement models that have existed since Winter's (1969) explication of the Riverton Culture, and which in the Middle Atlantic have been refined by Gardner (1987, 1989) and Custer (1984, 1988, 1990). That picture might be refined even more by observing that the smaller streams in effect associated with both kinds of sites provided both avenues of access to upland areas and sources for the small cobbles used in the microlithic compound tool industry (Neumann and Polglase 1991, 1992; Polglase et al. 1990, 1991).

The Late Archaic-bearing and the Early Woodland-bearing sites also contained a third site type that faced southwest or northwest. The locations of these sites relative to nearby streams, combined with their size and orientation, suggest that some may have been loci of mortuary sites. This possibility is offered as a hypothesis; it is based on highly circumstantial evidence.

Cluster analysis identified four Middle Woodland-bearing site types. Two of these were relatively large, lower elevation sites that were first occupied or re-occupied by Middle Woodland peoples. Presumably these represented late Middle Woodland sites. A third site type consisted of three small loci with northwesterly exposures. The location of these sites on terraces overlooking wide floodplains is similar to the locations of Middle Woodland stone mounds in the Shenandoah Valley (Gardner 1982). It is possible that this third set represent mortuary sites, although this, too, is highly speculative. The fourth site type consisted of higher elevation sites that in general should represent resource extraction sites.

Cluster analysis isolated three Late Woodland-bearing site types. Two of these represented larger, floodplain occupations; the third probably represented higher elevation, upper drainage resource extraction sites. However, that third set tended to be located close to relatively large streams.

## ENDNOTES

¹ Those archaeologists whose practices are located in the Upper Ohio Valley, including the appropriate parts of West Virginia, should take note that Middle Woodland and Late Woodland have different temporal and behavioral definitions for the Upper Potomac basin than they do in the lower Midwest or in the Southeast. There is no intention in this paper to begin examining the distribution of and the historical-political reasons for the differences in the use of cultural-historical terms that first appear with the appellation "Middle Woodland." This issue is considered in detail for eastern West Virginia in Neumann and Williams (1991) and in Davis et al. (1992a). Suffice it to say that the early Middle Woodland in the South Branch basin is equivalent to the Middle Woodland in the Upper Ohio drainage, the late Middle Woodland in the South Branch basin is equivalent to the Late Woodland in the Upper Ohio drainage, and the Late Woodland in the South Branch basin is equivalent to the Late Prehistoric in the Upper Ohio drainage.

## Trade and Exchange in Middle Atlantic Region Prehistory

In the Middle Atlantic region, extensive exchange networks are first visible during the Late Archaic period, or after 2500 B.C. Prior to this time, finds of artifacts at great distances (100 miles or more) from natural sources of their constituent materials can be noted. Expansive group territories crosscutting physiographic zones, relatively frequent settlement movements, low population densities, and sporadic unpatterned episodes of exchange or gift-giving are some of the factors responsible for these distributions (cf. Griffin 1978: 226; Handsman and McNett 1974: 38; Meltzer 1987; Stewart 1984a: 20-24).

This paper provides an overview of the evidence for prehistoric trade and exchange in the Middle Atlantic region from approximately 2500 B.C. until the time of concerted European contact during the early seventeenth century A.D. Distinctive types of exchange networks are defined and their function and relationships in prehistoric societies are explored. Likely models for the development and nature of trade and exchange systems are also presented. Both the types of trade defined and models of their development must be viewed as hypotheses in need of testing.

Following Renfrew (1969: 152), trade/exchange is used in its broadest sense as the reciprocal traffic, exchange, or movement of material goods through peaceful human agency. Sharing, the altruistic movement of goods (Snethkamp 1981:62), is also lumped under the rubric of exchange since it generally leads to reciprocal obligations in hunting and gathering societies (Sahlins 1972: 205). A pan-regional study of the distribution of rhyolite artifacts, their context, and morphology (Stewart 1984a,b) provides a basis for addressing the changing nature of exchange through time and serves as a comparative foil for examining the distribution and context of other exotic materials and artifacts. No other region-wide syntheses have been attempted although similar studies have been completed for large areas within the Middle Atlantic (Andrefsky 1983; Custer 1984a;
