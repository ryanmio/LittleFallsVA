# Black Population in Fairfax County

The legislative reforms which led to an election reform with universal white male suffrage instigated little discussion in local publications when compared to the slavery controversy which existed from the time of the Revolution through the early decades of the nineteenth century. Early travelers wrote that local men deplored the institution of slavery, but continued to keep their own slaves. As Elias Pym Fordham wrote in his travel diary of 1817, "almost all of them [Virginians] deplore the existence of slavery; though they think it must be continued, now it is introduced . . . but they (that is the young men) draw the dirks, which they usually wear... . . "[^1] When Anne Newport Royall wrote of her stay in Alexandria and the surrounding county she said that "the slaves of this place bear every mark of good treatment; they look happy and are comfortably clothed, though not half so fine or richly dressed; indeed the white people of this place lack a great deal of being dressed equal to the blacks of Huntsville [Alabama] or Lexington."[^2]

There are many cases in the courts, including Fairfax County courts, where blacks sought to be freed or to certify their freedom, but laws were enacted to make it more difficult for the slave to obtain his freedom. In 1798, an act excluded abolition society members, but not slaveholders, from juries hearing freedom suits[^3] This law combined with the fact that freedom suits were almost always prosecuted in the county courts "where the common county justices preside, and those justices often considerable slaveholders; under these circumstances the claimant must appear as clear as the sun at noon before it would be admitted for tryal." This "destroyed almost every suggestion of hope that any person . . . can obtain liberty by due process of law."[^4]

Gabriel's Insurrection was an attempted slave revolt organized near Richmond which was planned to affect the entire state. This uprising, thwarted at the last moment, plus the revolt in Santo Domingo, Haiti, caused a strong reaction against liberalization of the laws among many, but brought the problem to the forefront for many others. By 1803 the southern abolition societies had nearly disappeared, and further expansion of schools established for black children was discouraged.

There were contrary forces working in Fairfax County, however, which did not make it typical of the entire state. Large slaveholders were common in Fairfax County, but not to the extent found in more prosperous counties in the state. By the early nineteenth century, the Quakers and Methodist Society were quite active in this region, encouraging the education and sometimes emancipation of slaves. Particularly influential was the Adams family, who had been converted by Bishop Asbury in his travels, and who preached at the Fairfax Chapel between 1798 and 1810. Mrs. Ann Lawyer Adams is said to have-been particularly active in converting others, and her husband Col. William Adams, who died in 1809, gave freedom to over twenty slaves. Typical of others within the county, and incurring the wrath of some, was Col. James Wren, architect of the Falls Church, Christ Church, and the Fairfax County Courthouse, who once was a very active churchman and served on the vestry for more than twenty years. Colonel Wren was also a convert to Methodism, and two of his daughters married men in the Adams family who were active Methodist ministers. Sarah Wren, his wife, made provisions for some of her slaves to be freed when they came of age and were educated, and freed all her slaves after her death. It has been argued that persons such as Sarah Wren and William Adams had nothing to lose by freeing their slaves after their death, since they were able to use their services during their own lifetime, and those freed were often old. This is true in some cases, but in the instance of Sarah Wren her former slaves had accumulated enough money so that they were able to purchase some of their mistress' household items and personal goods from her estate. This probably means that the former slaves had been allowed to earn and to keep their wages, while still technically slaves.[^5]

Other persons who were kept as slaves within the county were able to enjoy at least a semblance of a normal life and live as a family group. This is noted in the inventory of William Fitzhugh's estate where a good number of the total 232 slaves were listed by family group. That is, the name of the person, his age, and that of wife and children were grouped together, with the value of the entire family noted:

```
Ben Douglas age30_..... $350
Scharlotte i bs ae re 250
Sintha TA etn. ook 250
Lucy 68 make 150
Franky Dir cian hes 100
$1,100
```

Most of those listed as a family group had a last name, an unusual practice, and some were listed with their occupations such as smith, carpenter, cook, or tanner.[^6]

The law of 1806 forbidding any freed slave to remain in Virginia more than twelve months was later amended to permit local courts to give manumitted slaves permission to continue to live in Virginia if they had performed some act of "extraordinary merit," or if they were persons of "good character, sober, peaceable, orderly and industrious." These amendments of 1815 and 1837 stood throughout the antebellum years.[^7] The initial statute of 1806, however, caused a reaction in other states where freed slaves were apt to go and these other states followed by enacting similar laws, such as those found in Maryland, Kentucky, and Delaware. Within twenty-five years, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee had passed similar laws. The result was, of course, that a freed slave had no place to go except to the north or to the far west, if he or she could find a way to get there.

Some slaves did not wait for their masters to offer freedom, or for the courts to certify their liberty; they bought it with their own hard work. Many slaves bought their liberty with money they earned while hiring their own time. George Drinker explained the decline of slavery in the Northern Neck as partly the result of the "practice among lenient slaveholders of setting a moderate value on the time of slaves and suffering them to hire out at the best terms they could get."[^8]

The Common Council of Alexandria passed a bill in 1806 which would "prevent migration of free negroes and mulattoes, into the corporation of Alexandria and to prescribe the mode of registering the same and to enforce the payment of their capitation tax."[^9] This bill was obviously passed by those in Alexandria who feared that the urban atmosphere might be attractive to persons hiding from the strict Virginia law, while still finding work. The Gazette almost daily carried advertisements of businesses offering employment opportunities for blacks, even though of a menial nature.

The Fairfax County court records quite effectively recount the varying moods of the white citizens in the judgments brought before the court. Many advertisements were placed in the local newspapers, including the Alexandria Gazette, for runaway slaves; the rewards ranged from ten to one hundred dollars, depending on the economic situation of the times and the value of the slave to the holder. Because a slave was apprehended did not mean that he would be returned to his owner, as the records point out.

In 1800, a runaway, or even a free man, was often returned to the former owner at the court's expense. For instance, when "John Bell, a free mulatto, was committed to the gaol of this county, on suspicion of being a runaway being this day brought before the court and on hearing it is ordered that he do return to the state of Maryland and that the gaoler charge the expense of his keeping to the county."[^10] At the same time, if the black man could not or did not produce the right papers, and no one claimed the person as a slave, he was liable for court costs. "James Conner, Gaoler, brought before the court a negro man slave named Will who was committed to the gaol of this County as a runaway and the said negro having remained in for upwards of two months and no person appearing to claim him, and it appearing to the court that he has been advertised according to law, it is the opinion of the court that he ought to be hired out for the payment of his gaol fees at a sum not less than 20% per month."[^11] By 1807, the same situation could apply to a black man only suspected of being a runaway, accruing prison fees of $24.05 in two months. In such a situation the jailer was "ordered that he hire the said negro immediately at public auction for the shortest time that any person will pay the amount aforesaid and that the said negro was hired to Wm. Payne for one year for the amount aforesaid."[^12] After this man's year of servitude was over, the problem was usually the payment of prison fees, often a considerable sum for the times. If the fees were paid, the man was freed. Money was the key, and if the black was able to earn and keep ready cash, then he usually would have a chance to remain free. Some whites did leave sums of money to their slaves in their wills, as did Sarah Wren.[^13]
