# Falls Church 22042: A Modern Postal Village

## Source Information
A talk given by Nan Netherton at St. Patrick's Episcopal Church, Brush Drive, Falls Church, Virginia on Friday, April 23, 1993.

This document contains the transcript of Nan Netherton's 1993 lecture on Falls Church's development as a "modern postal village" - examining how the postal code 22042 helped define the community's identity and boundaries in the modern era.

## Content

Many of the early English landowners of the 1600s and 1700s were men of consequence who acquired large parcels of land. What is now Fairfax County land was in the 1700s first within Stafford County, then within the boundaries of Prince William County, and after it was established in 1742, within Fairfax County. 

Thus one can understand why Catesby Cocke was able to serve successively as clerk of the courts of Stafford, Prince William and Fairfax counties and reside and own land in the same place the entire time. He was an energetic speculator in Northern Neck Proprietary lands and acquired a total of 1633 acres in Fairfax County between 1731 and 1749, most of it within the 22042 area. [Beth Mitchell. Beginning at a White Oak... Grants and Patents] 

For William Fitzhugh, 21,996 acres called "Ravensworth" were patented in 1694. He was a lawyer, commander of the Stafford County militia, a Stafford court justice, and an agent for the Northern Neck Proprietors. Other early surnames in the modern postal village area shown on Beth Mitchell's Grants and Patents Map include Pearson, Harle, Emms, Broadwater, Trammell, Gunnell and Harrison.

There are several watercourses in the vicinity; Holmes Run is the most important stream. Its waters were dammed to form Lake Barcroft, once a reservoir for the Alexandria Water Company. [Netherton, et al. Fairfax County, 1978] Its name changes to Cameron Run and finally to Great Hunting Creek before the waters of Holmes Run and its several tributaries empty into the Potomac River.

In the late 1940s, '50s, and '60s, subdivision building was booming as the growth of the Federal government brought thousands of veterans, their families, and other employees to fill the available work force slots. [Netherton, et al. Fairfax County, Virginia: A History. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, 1978] 

Eakin Properties built the Sleepy Hollow subdivision; other developers built more modest dwellings at Westlawn, Bel Air, Jefferson Village, North and South Woodley, Broyhill Park, Tyler Park, Ramondale, Beech Tree Manor, and Walnut Hill, to mention some of the names.

Holmes Run Acres was a subdivision built on the east side of Gallows Road, south of Route 50, Arlington Boulevard, in 1950, by Gerald and Eli Luria. Several different styles and sizes of contemporary homes were designed by architects Nicholas Satterlee and Francis Lethbridge. The stream valley recreation area running through the community was named Luria Park after the developers.

More than 40 years of monthly Holmes Runner newsletters have been collected and bound and placed in the Virginia Room at the Fairfax Public Library for use of county residents, and future historians and sociologists who want to learn about life in one active community over that time period.

But we have been talking about developments of the past 50 or 60 years. What about earlier times? Native Americans lived right here in many different sites for centuries before the Europeans arrived to stay in the 1600s. 

While the mixed-use buildings, including the Marriott Hotel, were being constructed at Fairview Park in 1985, at Routes 50 and 495, Fairfax County archaeologists were given permission by the developers to spend a full year to recover Indian artifacts from the A.D. 200-1500 site while construction went on around it. Human habitation of the immediate area has proven to have existed almost 2,000 years ago through the work of local archaeologists at this excavation.
