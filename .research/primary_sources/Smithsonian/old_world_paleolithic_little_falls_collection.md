# Little Falls Artifacts in Smithsonian Collections

## Historical Context

In the late 19th century, the Smithsonian Institution was actively collecting and exchanging prehistoric artifacts both from North America and Europe. The following excerpt documents that artifacts from Little Falls were part of these significant collections, demonstrating the archaeological importance of the area:

> You may send me anything else pertaining to Prehistoric man in America and it will be of great use. They are now seeking to extend their collections to include representations from other countries, for purposes of comparison and in North American objects they are very poor. So I could utilize them with effect. I do not wish rare or fine or fancy or expensive articlesâ€”but only those of every day use among the savages of our country. I saw at Turin a collection sent from Washington consisting [of] stone axes, hammers spear and arrow heads &c.&c. from 'Bennings Bridge,' 'Little Falls,' 'Maryland' &c.&c. amounting to about a thousand pieces. Who sent them I don't know, but when I saw this riches and thought with what effect I might use it for the benefit of your Institution I confess to a feeling of jealousy and annoyance.

This excerpt comes from correspondence regarding Thomas Wilson, who would later become the Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology at the Smithsonian. The letter, dated October 18, 1884, indicates that artifacts from Little Falls were considered significant enough to be included in international museum exchanges, suggesting extensive prehistoric Native American activity in the area.

## Archaeological Significance

The reference to "stone axes, hammers, spear and arrow heads" from Little Falls indicates that:

1. The area was a site of significant Native American tool-making and habitation
2. A substantial collection of artifacts had been gathered from the site
3. These artifacts were notable enough to be included in international museum exchanges
4. The Smithsonian had catalogued and preserved these materials as part of their early collections

The fact that these Little Falls artifacts were part of a collection "amounting to about a thousand pieces" that had been sent to Turin, Italy demonstrates the significance of the area in archaeological studies of the late 19th century.
