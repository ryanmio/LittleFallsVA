# Democratic Ticket and Political Coverage from Fairfax Herald, 1888

## Raw Text Transcription

### Democratic Ticket
For President, GROVER CLEVELAND, OF NEW YORK.
For Vice-President, ALLEN G. THURMAN, OF OHIO.
For Congressâ€”8th District, Gen. W. H. F. LEE, OF FAIRFAX.

### Vote The Democratic Ticket!
"Every man who wishes to see prosperity and peace prevail in the country should vote the Democratic ticket on Tuesday next. To the Democratic party are the people of the South indebted for their emancipation from Republican misrule just after the war. Even Republicans must admit that the condition of the Southern States is today far better than it would have been had the proscriptive policy of their party prevailed and negro rule been fastened upon us. Could any self-respecting white man witness the negro parade here on Thursday last and not feel that it was a duty he owed to his family and his State to preserve his country from the control of such people? If there was no other reason for voting the Democratic ticket this alone should be sufficient."

### Racial Politics and Falls Church Reference
"Even now the negroes (and they constitute the great bulk of the Republican party in the South) do not hesitate to persecute colored men who have the intelligence and the courage to vote the Democratic ticket. Recently three colored Republicans in Spotsylvania whipped a colored Democrat because he was going to vote the Democratic ticket. Only a short time ago another colored Democrat in another county had his house burned down and narrowly escaped with his life. At Falls Church, in our own county, not long ago, a colored Democrat was attacked and beaten because he was a Democrat. The only offence of these maltreated colored Democrats was that they refused longer blindly to join their race in giving political power and office to a small white minority in the State."

### Senate Balance of Power
"On the 4th of March, John S. Barbour, of Virginia, will take his seat in the Senate, and unless the Republicans can carry the Legislature of West Virginia or that of New Jersey on the 6th of November, and get a U.S. Senator from one of those States, the Senate will be a tie, to be decided by Allen G. Thurman or Levi P. Morton. The reasons for voting the Democratic ticket are therefore so many and so great, that it seems incomprehensible that any one should seriously contemplate withholding his vote for that party on Tuesday next."

### Election Supervision
"Republican United States supervisors of election, we understand, have been appointed at each voting precinct in the county. The Democrats, knowing the elections are always fairly conducted here, have neither asked for nor desired the appointment of supervisors. Let not the judges or the canvassers at the polls be intimidated by the presence of these people. They have no right to interfere with the proper conduct of the election, and if they (the supervisors) transgress their authority and seek on election day to improperly control the election by intimidation or otherwise, they become law breakers, and will be punished as such."

### Tariff Arguments
"The high tariff increases the price of nearly everything they eat, wear or use, while their wages are in no wise affected by it. A vote, therefore, to continue the present tariff, is a vote to tax themselves forty-seven cents on every dollar's worth of goods they buy. They impose this burden upon themselves under the mistaken idea that the extra amount they pay goes to increase the wages of the operatives in the Northern and Eastern factories."

"The increased price that we pay for goods does not go to the workmen in factories; but to their relentless employers, many of the latter, like Carnegie, while clearing $1,500,000 a year, or more, from their 'protected industries,' employ the cheapest foreign labor they can get. A vote for the Republican party is a vote to enrich a few at the expense of the many. A vote for the Democratic party is a vote to give every man the full and legitimate benefit of his own earnings."

### Terse Tariff Talks
"The battle for tariff revision and tax reduction is a battle for the emancipation of the industrial people of the nation. Never in the past history of the country, except when war demanded taxes on everything, were the people so highly taxed as they are now taxed on the common necessaries of life."

"The farmer is taxed on everything he buys or uses for home or farm, and he is unprotected in his labor, as his products are cheaper here than abroad. He is not only taxed by needless tariff taxes, but arbitrarily taxed by the greed of trusts."

### In Support of General W.H.F. Lee
"Gen. Lee has made a faithful and efficient representative, and has never neglected an opportunity to serve his district and people. His term of service in Congress will be one of great benefit to him in the future, as older members, who are familiar with the intricate rules governing the body, are better qualified to secure actions on bills in which their constituents are interested, than are new members who have all these things to learn."

"It should be the pride of Fairfax to give him a majority even in excess of the handsome but well deserved one given him two years ago. Let us all work to give him 600 at least. Yes, let the champion of the people's rights be returned to the next House of Representatives with an increased majority, for he has proved himself worthy and capable of serving his party and the democrats should unite in giving him a splendid victory."

### Voter Turnout Concerns
"There is never near election times a condition of apathy among the negro voters. They value the right of suffrage very highly and never neglect to exercise it. The Democrats lost Virginia in 1886 for the reason that the whites were apathetic whilst the negroes were as usual, almost every man of them at the ballot-box. It follows that a still hunt is the best mode of carrying an election that Mahone can resort to. His colored troops are always ready for action, and therefore if the Democratic white forces can be lulled by a still-hunt into a condition of indifference or over-confidence a Republican victory must almost inevitably result."

"Let every Democrat burnish up his arms and go forth to fight whether there be an enemy in sight or not. You may rest assured that the opposition will show themselves in their full strength next week."

## Analysis and Significance

This November 2, 1888 edition of the Fairfax Herald provides important evidence of Falls Church's status within Fairfax County during the post-Reconstruction era. The specific mention that "At Falls Church, in our own county, not long ago, a colored Democrat was attacked and beaten because he was a Democrat" confirms several important historical facts:

1. Falls Church was firmly considered part of Fairfax County in 1888
2. Racial and political tensions were present in Falls Church as they were throughout the South
3. The community had Black residents who were politically active in both parties

The newspaper's overall tone reflects the intense racial politics of the post-Reconstruction South, with Democrats positioning themselves as defenders against what they termed "negro rule" while simultaneously claiming to support voting rights for Black Democrats.

The reported incident of violence against a Black Democrat in Falls Church illustrates how the community was integrated into the broader political struggles of the era, when racial intimidation was often used as a political tool.

This document adds to our understanding of Falls Church during the late 19th century as a community with established political identity, racial diversity, and connection to broader national political currents centered on Reconstruction politics, tariff reform, and partisan competition.
