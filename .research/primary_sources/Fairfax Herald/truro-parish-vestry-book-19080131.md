# Review of Truro Parish Vestry Book History

## Transcription

"We take the liberty of making the following extract from the Introduction by Mr. Goodwin:

'No Parish in the Colony had a Vestry more distinguished in its personnel, or more fully qualified for their positions, than the Parish of Truro. Of its earlier members indeed little has come down to us but their names inscribed on almost every page of the scant records remaining to tell of the settlement of these upper reaches of the 'Northern Neck,' and the establishment of religion and civilization in what was then but a wilderness. But later her Vestrymen are found ranking among the first gentlemen of Virginia in position and influence. Eleven of them sat at various times in the House of Burgesses. Two of them, the Fairfaxes, were members of 'His Majesty's Council of Virginia.' Another of her Vestrymen was George Mason, one of the first among the founders of the State and the great political thinker of his age, while still another was declared to be the 'Greatest man of any age,' the imperial George Washington.'

'The work of recovering and preserving the records was begun by the late Rev. Dr. Philip Slaughter, who, a few years before his death, was so fortunate as to discover the whereabouts of the old Vestry Book of Truro Parish which had been lost to sight for three quarters of a century. Advancing years prevented him from giving the work the revision and corrections he had intended, and the incomplete manuscript was entrusted to Rev. Dr. Samuel A. Wallis, then Rector of Pohick, and at the request of the latter Mr. Goodwin prepared the history for publication. His work in this regard displays the master hand. The manuscript was wholly re-written, and embraces more copious extracts from the records of the Vestry than were originally incorporated. Mr. Goodwin's pen has contributed in large measure to the great value of the work, and it is a book that should be in the library of every citizen of the county. It is sold at the very reasonable price of $1.50, and can be obtained by addressing Rev. Edward L. Goodwin, Fairfax, Va.'

In tracing the history of the old churches in Fairfax, the names of scores of the old and well known families are mentioned. Thousands of their descendants are living to-day, every one of whom should possess a copy of the work. It is rich in historic data and the best of its kind that has come under our observation."

## Historical Context

This 1908 newspaper review discusses the publication of a history of Truro Parish's Vestry Book, prepared by Rev. Edward L. Goodwin. The review highlights the significance of Truro Parish in colonial Virginia, particularly noting the distinguished nature of its vestrymen, including George Washington and George Mason.

Truro Parish was one of the most influential Anglican parishes in colonial Virginia, serving the areas that would become Fairfax County and parts of Loudoun County. The parish was established in 1732, and its territorial bounds initially encompassed a vast area including what would later become Falls Church.

The publication being reviewed represented a significant historical recovery effort, as the Vestry Book had been lost for approximately 75 years before being rediscovered by Rev. Dr. Philip Slaughter in the late 19th century. Vestry books were essential administrative records that documented not only church affairs but also many aspects of civil governance in colonial Virginia.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1908 article is relevant to the Little Falls, VA renaming initiative for several reasons:

1. **Colonial Church Governance**: Truro Parish was the original Anglican parish that encompassed the area that would later become Falls Church. Understanding the parish structure helps explain the early development of churches in Fairfax County, including The Falls Church.

2. **Historical Connections**: The mention of George Washington as a vestryman of Truro Parish establishes a connection between the broader Falls Church area and important founding figures. This context is valuable for understanding the historical significance of the region.

3. **Administrative Evolution**: The article indirectly documents how church administrative boundaries helped shape early community identity in Fairfax County. The Falls Church itself was initially a "chapel of ease" within Truro Parish before the establishment of Fairfax Parish in 1765, showing how communities gradually developed their own identities.

4. **Documentation of Early Settlement**: The article references the "upper reaches of the 'Northern Neck'" and the "establishment of religion and civilization in what was then but a wilderness," providing context for understanding early European settlement patterns in the area that would include Falls Church and Little Falls.

5. **Preservation of Historical Records**: This 1908 publication represents an early effort to preserve and document the history of the region, demonstrating the ongoing community interest in maintaining connections to its colonial past - a value that also informs the current renaming initiative.

While this article does not directly mention Falls Church or Little Falls, it provides essential context for understanding the colonial church structure from which Falls Church emerged and how vestry governance helped shape early community development throughout what is now Fairfax County. The preservation of these historical connections aligns with the goals of the Little Falls renaming initiative, which seeks to reconnect the community with its authentic historical identity.
