# Truro Parish Vestry Book - First Written Record of 'Falls Church' Name (1757)

## Image Description
Facsimile of the Truro Parish Vestry Book from November 28, 1757, showing the earliest known written use of the name "Falls Church." The name appears prominently in financial records (middle of the page) detailing payments made to local church officials: "John Samlby Clk" (Clerk) at "Falls Church & Alexandria" (receiving 2,000 units), and "Owen Palmore Sexton" (church caretaker) at "Falls Church" (receiving 560 units). This document confirms the early existence and official recognition of Falls Church as a distinct location within Truro Parish, decades before the town itself was formally incorporated.

## Historical Significance
This document represents the first known written record of the name "Falls Church," establishing the term's usage in official colonial records. The vestry book entry predates the formal establishment of the town, showing that the church itself (and its location near the falls) was already a recognized landmark and community center in the mid-18th century.
