# Chain Bridge over the Potomac at Little Falls near Georgetown

![Chain Bridge over the Potomac at Little Falls near Georgetown](https://www.pafa.org/sites/default/files/artworkpics/1981_x_3_l.jpg)

## Description

This etching depicts the original Chain Bridge spanning across the Potomac River at Little Falls near Georgetown. The view shows the suspension bridge with its distinctive chains, from which it derived its name. In the foreground are trees and foliage framing the scene, with the rocky river banks visible below.

The bridge was designed with a 128-foot deck of oak planks suspended from chains made of four-and-a-half foot links anchored in massive stone abutments. This design was based on a patent by James Finley of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. The Chain Bridge was the third bridge built at this site after two previous wooden structures failed in 1804.

This image represents an important piece of Fairfax County history, as the bridge was a crucial transportation link between Virginia and Maryland, facilitating the movement of agricultural goods from the Shenandoah Valley to Georgetown markets in the early 19th century.

## Artist Information

The print was created by M. Stuart after a drawing by John Gadsby Chapman (1808-1889). Chapman was an American artist known for his painting and illustrations, particularly of Virginia landscapes and historical scenes. He was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and later studied in Europe before returning to America where he became known for his detailed lithographs and engravings of American scenes.

## Provenance

This print is held in the John S. Phillips Collection at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA).
