## Historical Context

This advertisement from 1805 represents the disturbing reality of slavery in early America, including the Falls Church area. Benjamin Dulany, a member of the prominent Dulany family of Maryland and Virginia, was liquidating both human property (enslaved people) and farming equipment from his plantation near Falls Church.

The advertisement illustrates several aspects of the economy and society of the time:

1. The casual dehumanization of enslaved persons, referred to as "likely NEGROES" - a common term in slave sales indicating individuals who were considered physically capable and healthy

2. The approach to selling human beings as property alongside farm equipment and livestock

3. The extension of credit (6 months) for purchasers, indicating the financial scale of these sales

4. The continued presence of large slaveholding plantations in the Falls Church area into the early 19th century

The Dulany family was prominent in colonial and early American Virginia. They owned significant property and were influential in political and economic circles. This advertisement indicates that Benjamin Dulany may have been reducing his holdings or possibly relocating, as he was selling "All his Stock & Farming Utensils" as well as enslaved people.

This document, while deeply troubling in its content, provides important historical evidence of the economic and social structures that defined this period of Falls Church history and the centrality of the institution of slavery to the local economy and society.
