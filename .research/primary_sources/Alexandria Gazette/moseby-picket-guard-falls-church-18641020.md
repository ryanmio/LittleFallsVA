# Mosby's Command Captures Federal Picket Guard near Fall's Church

## Transcription

"Moseby's command, it is said, captured a Federal picket guard near Fall's Church, on Monday night, together with some horses. It is said also that they carried off a Mr. Reed, and two negro men."

## Historical Context

This brief October 20, 1864 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on another operation by Colonel John Singleton Mosby's Confederate partisan rangers. The raid resulted in:

1. The capture of a Federal picket guard near Falls Church
2. The seizure of horses (a common target for Mosby's operations)
3. The abduction of a civilian named Mr. Reed and two Black men

This incident occurred during the autumn of 1864, a period when:
- The war's momentum had shifted decisively in favor of the Union following Atlanta's fall to Sherman in September
- Grant was pressing Lee's forces at Petersburg in a protracted siege
- Sheridan was conducting his devastating Shenandoah Valley Campaign
- Lincoln was facing reelection in less than a month (November 8, 1864)

Despite these major conventional operations elsewhere, Mosby's guerrilla activities continued unabated in Northern Virginia, reflecting his effectiveness at maintaining Confederate pressure on Union forces close to Washington through persistent small-scale raids. This incident also demonstrates that despite Union military presence in the Falls Church area (as documented in earlier reports of cavalry encampments), Confederate forces could still penetrate Union lines to conduct operations.

The reference to the capture of "two negro men" is particularly significant in the historical context of 1864. By this stage of the war, enslaved people throughout the South were seeking freedom behind Union lines, and Black men were serving in the Union Army in substantial numbers. Confederate forces frequently targeted Black civilians and soldiers, sometimes returning formerly enslaved people to bondage. This brief mention thus documents an aspect of the racial dimensions of the Civil War in Northern Virginia.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This October 20, 1864 newspaper reference is notable for using "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe, continuing the pattern of inconsistent naming conventions observed throughout 1864:

1. **Continued Inconsistency**: As late as October 1864, the Alexandria Gazette was still using "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe), despite having generally shifted toward "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) since mid-1863.

2. **Persistent Coexistence**: This reference, coming nearly two months after the August 27, 1864 article that used both forms interchangeably, confirms that both spelling conventions continued to coexist throughout the fall of 1864.

3. **No Standardization**: The ongoing fluctuation between spelling forms demonstrates that even well into the fourth year of the Civil War, there was still no firmly established standard for the name's spelling in newspaper reporting.

4. **Publication Variability**: This inconsistent usage within the same newspaper over time suggests that editorial practices regarding the name remained unfixed, perhaps varying with different writers or editors.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This October 1864 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Extended Naming Fluidity**: The continued use of "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) as late as October 1864 extends our documentation of naming inconsistency throughout nearly the entire Civil War period.

2. **Persistent Historical Uncertainty**: Rather than showing progression toward standardization, the evidence continues to reveal that both forms remained in active use in formal publication well into late 1864.

3. **Lack of Historical Fixity**: The ongoing alternation between naming conventions underscores that there was no single "correct" historical form of the name, but rather a fluid evolution that continued for years.

4. **Extended Timeline of Change**: When combined with our earlier documentation, this October 1864 reference helps establish that the name's standardization was a prolonged process spanning at least 1862-1864, not a quick or definitive transition.

When added to our existing timeline, this October 1864 reference further reinforces the argument that the current name "Falls Church" emerged through a long, complex, and inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing a fixed historical designation. The documented pattern of naming fluidity throughout the Civil War period provides strong historical precedent for the premise that place names naturally change over time, making the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" consistent with, rather than contrary to, the area's historical pattern of place name evolution.
