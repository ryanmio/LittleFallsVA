# Confederate Forces Near and Occupying Falls Church

## Transcription

"Information reached Washington yesterday that a force of Confederates were at the Frying Pan, on Goose Creek, seven miles above Falls Church, and it was conjectured that their purpose is to make a demonstration against the fortifications on the south side, when they may think that the operations on the north side shall have induced the withdrawal of the forces in the works on the Virginia side of the Potomac.--Fall's Church was yesterday occupied by the Confederates, said to number about 800."

## Historical Context

This July 13, 1864 article in the Alexandria Gazette reports on Confederate movements near Washington, D.C., during what would become known as Early's Raid on Washington. Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early led his corps from the Shenandoah Valley to the outskirts of Washington in July 1864, threatening the Union capital while the main Union armies were occupied with Grant's campaign against Richmond and Petersburg.

The article describes two significant military developments around Falls Church:

1. Confederate forces positioned at Frying Pan (near Goose Creek), about seven miles from Falls Church, possibly preparing to attack Washington's southern defenses
2. The occupation of Falls Church itself by approximately 800 Confederate troops

This occurred during a critical moment in the Civil War, when:
- Confederate forces were within sight of the U.S. Capitol dome
- Railroad and telegraph connections between Washington and Baltimore had been cut
- The Union was hurriedly assembling defenders, including "Union Leagues" of civilian volunteers

The occupation of Falls Church by Confederate forces came just days after the picnic incident reported in the July 11 issue of the same newspaper, where Mosby's men had danced with local women before making off with their picnic supplies. This new military occupation represented a much more serious Confederate presence, part of a coordinated campaign against Washington rather than a guerrilla raid.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling Variation

This July 13, 1864 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy because it uses both spelling conventions within the same article:

1. **Mixed Usage**: The article first refers to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) and then to "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) just sentences apart, in the same paragraph.

2. **Editorial Inconsistency**: This mixed usage in a single article demonstrates that even in mid-1864, after nearly a year of generally standardized usage in the Alexandria Gazette, the spelling was still not fully settled.

3. **Same Author, Same Article**: Unlike previous examples where different spelling conventions appeared in different articles potentially written by different correspondents, this inconsistency appears within text likely written by the same person.

4. **Continued Fluidity**: This dual usage suggests that the standardization process was incomplete, with both forms still considered acceptable even within formal reporting.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 1864 reference provides compelling support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Ongoing Naming Evolution**: The mixed usage of both "Falls Church" and "Fall's Church" in the same article shows that naming conventions remained fluid even a year into what we had identified as the "standardization period."

2. **Documented Inconsistency**: This reference captures the clearest evidence yet of ongoing uncertainty about the "correct" spelling of the name, with both forms used interchangeably by the same writer.

3. **Strategic Importance**: The Confederate occupation of Falls Church further establishes its strategic significance during the Civil War as a location worth controlling militarily.

4. **Geographical Framework**: The reference to Falls Church as a recognized reference point for describing other locations ("seven miles above Falls Church") confirms its status as an established geographical marker.

When added to our existing timeline, this July 13, 1864 reference significantly complicates the narrative of straightforward standardization. Rather than showing a clean transition from the possessive "Fall's Church" to the non-possessive "Falls Church," it reveals that both forms continued to coexist even in formal writing, sometimes within the same text.

This documented fluidity in naming conventions provides strong historical precedent for the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing historical and cultural contexts. The evidence shows that even the current name of Falls Church emerged through a complex and inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing an unchanging historical designation.
