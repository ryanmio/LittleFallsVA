# 2nd District of Columbia Regiment Picketing from Falls Church to Vienna

## Transcription

"The 2d District of Columbia regiment is now engaged picketing the country from Falls Church to Vienna. Col. Alexander's headquarters at Vienna, and that of Lieut. Col. Drew at Falls Church."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from the November 6, 1863 edition of the Alexandria Gazette reports on the deployment of the 2nd District of Columbia Regiment along the strategic corridor between Falls Church and Vienna, Virginia. The regiment's mission was "picketing" - establishing a defensive perimeter with sentries and outposts to guard against enemy movement or infiltration.

This military deployment highlights several important aspects of the Civil War in Northern Virginia:

1. **Strategic Importance**: The Falls Church to Vienna corridor required ongoing military protection more than two and a half years into the war, indicating its strategic value for controlling access to Washington, D.C.

2. **Continued Confederate Threat**: Despite major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, Confederate forces (particularly irregular units like Mosby's Rangers) remained active in Northern Virginia, necessitating constant vigilance.

3. **Military Infrastructure**: The establishment of a regimental headquarters at Falls Church underscores the area's development as a significant military outpost during the war.

4. **Divided Command Structure**: The regiment operated with split headquarters - the commanding officer (Col. Alexander) at Vienna and the second-in-command (Lt. Col. Drew) at Falls Church - indicating the importance of maintaining command presence at both locations.

This deployment occurred during a relatively quiet period on the main battlefronts following the Bristoe Campaign (October 1863), when the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia were regrouping. During such periods, maintaining picket lines and defensive perimeters against guerrilla activities became even more important for Union forces.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This November 6, 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern observed in the Alexandria Gazette throughout the second half of 1863, using "Falls Church" without the apostrophe. This consistent usage over a four-month period (July through November 1863) strengthens the evidence for a deliberate standardization toward the non-possessive form:

1. **Consistent Editorial Policy**: The Alexandria Gazette appears to have adopted a consistent editorial approach to the spelling by late 1863, suggesting an intentional standardization rather than random variation.

2. **Military Recognition**: The placement of a regimental headquarters at "Falls Church" indicates that this spelling was being used in official military communications and planning.

3. **Geographic Significance**: Falls Church is presented as a location of comparable strategic importance to Vienna, further cementing its status as a recognized community and military position rather than simply a church building.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This November 1863 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Standardization Timeline**: The continued use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe from July through November 1863 reinforces the pattern of standardization toward the modern spelling during the Civil War period.

2. **Military Significance**: The establishment of a regimental headquarters at Falls Church confirms the area's strategic importance during the Civil War and its recognition as a distinct community by military authorities.

3. **Ongoing Name Evolution**: When viewed in sequence with earlier references, this November 1863 mention adds to the documentation of how the name evolved from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church" over time.

4. **Community Identity Formation**: The designation of Falls Church as important enough to host a regimental headquarters reflects its development as a recognized community with military significance beyond its religious origins.

This reference, coming at the end of 1863, helps establish a clear timeline for the evolution of the name toward its modern spelling. The pattern of consistent usage in the Alexandria Gazette throughout the second half of 1863 shows that the standardization process, while still ongoing, was becoming more firmly established by the end of that year.

Just as the name evolved from "Fall's Church" to "Falls Church" during this period, the proposed change to "Little Falls, VA" represents another evolution that reconnects the community with its original geographical identity, consistent with the historical pattern of place names naturally changing to reflect their historical and cultural context.
