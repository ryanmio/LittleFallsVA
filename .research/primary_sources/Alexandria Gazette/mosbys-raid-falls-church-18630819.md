# Mosby's Latest Raid Near Falls Church

## Transcription

"Mosby's Latest Raid.—We are indebted to a gentleman residing near Falls Church, and not far from Bailey's Cross Roads, for the annexed account of the raid of Mosby on Sunday last:—[Nat. Int.]

"On the 16th, just about daylight, Mosby and fifty-four of his men were seen about a mile from fort Buffalo, with three Union soldiers and some horses with harness that they had captured from a train of sutlers early in the night before. They disappeared suddenly in the woods for the time being, but about nine o'clock at night Mosby, with fifteen men and those three Union prisoners, made their appearance at the northwest end of Falls Church village, and turned to the left of the Leesburg turnpike, on the Lewinsville road, through by the contraband camp on Major Nutt's place; then through by the Brick Chapel to the turnpike by Fort Buffalo, down the turnpike one mile below Bailey's Cross Roads; then back the same route to the railroad. Mosby and six men dismounted and approached the contraband camp, when the guard halted him; he gave no reply and moved on, when the guard shot and one of the Union prisoners made his escape. Mosby then fell back and moved through Falls Church up the turnpike to a little tavern, where they stopped, and was telling the keeper of the hotel where they had been, and that they could go where they pleased, when a detachment of the California cavalry came up and drove them beyond Difficult run four miles from Dranesville."

## Historical Context

This August 19, 1863 account in the Alexandria Gazette details a raid conducted by Confederate partisan ranger Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his men on August 16, 1863. Mosby was known for his lightning raids behind Union lines, earning him the nickname "the Gray Ghost." This report, attributed to a local resident near Falls Church, describes Mosby's movements with typical precision:

1. Mosby and 54 men were spotted near Fort Buffalo with captured Union soldiers and horses
2. Later that night, Mosby with a smaller force of 15 men appeared at Falls Church village
3. They traveled through various local landmarks including the contraband camp (a settlement for escaped slaves)
4. An encounter with guards resulted in one Union prisoner escaping
5. Mosby returned through Falls Church before being pursued by California cavalry

The raid occurred during a period following the major battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg (July 1863), when Confederate forces were increasingly turning to guerrilla-style warfare in Northern Virginia to disrupt Union supply lines and maintain pressure on Union forces despite diminishing conventional military capabilities.

The reference to "contraband camp" reflects the presence of freed or escaped slaves who had sought protection behind Union lines. These individuals were initially classified as "contraband of war" (hence the name) when they fled to Union forces.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This August 19, 1863 newspaper reference is noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Continued Inconsistency**: The article uses "Falls Church" without the apostrophe consistently throughout, continuing the pattern seen in the July 15, 1863 notice from the same newspaper. This suggests that by mid-to-late summer 1863, the non-possessive form was becoming more standard in the Alexandria Gazette.

2. **Multiple References**: The article refers to "Falls Church" twice - first as a location ("near Falls Church") and later as an established village ("Falls Church village"), demonstrating that the name was now applied to both the church building and the surrounding community.

3. **Local Source**: The information comes from "a gentleman residing near Falls Church," suggesting that local residents were using this form of the name.

4. **Detailed Geography**: The account provides precise geographical details, showing that Falls Church was an established landmark with recognized relationships to other local features (northwest end, relation to the Leesburg turnpike, etc.).

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 19, 1863 reference provides additional evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Naming Convention Evolution**: Coming five weeks after the July 11-15, 1863 references that showed both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" being used interchangeably, this consistently non-possessive usage suggests the name was still evolving throughout 1863.

2. **Community Identity Formation**: The reference to "Falls Church village" shows that by August 1863, the name was being applied to the settlement rather than just the church building itself, representing a key step in the evolution from a landmark to a community identity.

3. **Historical Significance**: The account shows Falls Church's strategic importance during the Civil War as a location through which military movements occurred and where infrastructure (roads, railroad) converged.

4. **Connection to Major Events**: The document connects Falls Church to significant Civil War figures and events (Mosby's raids), highlighting its place in the broader historical narrative of Virginia.

When added to our existing timeline of historical references, this August 1863 account further documents the fluid nature of naming conventions during the Civil War period. It demonstrates that even within a single newspaper, naming practices for Falls Church evolved throughout 1863, shifting from the possessive form ("Fall's Church") to the non-possessive form ("Falls Church") that would eventually become standardized.

This fluid evolution of the name supports the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally change over time to reflect historical context and community understanding, making the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" consistent with, rather than contrary to, historical precedent.
