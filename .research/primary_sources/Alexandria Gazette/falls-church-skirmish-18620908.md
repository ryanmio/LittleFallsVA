# Artillery Skirmish at Fall's Church

## Transcription

"WAR NEWS.

Gen. McClellan, it is understood, is now to take the field. All the officers in Washington have been ordered to their commands. The Confederate force on the upper Potomac is said to consist of the forces under the command of Gens. Jackson, Ewell, Longstreet and Walker.

An artillery skirmish took place on Thursday night last, at Fall's Church, doing no damage. The Federal force occupying the position at Aquia Creek evacuated the place on Friday last, after removing all the stores and destroying the depot buildings.

The Federal troops were yet in possession of Martinsburg, Virginia, yesterday. A dispatch states the Confederates, four hundred strong, attacked the outposts, but were defeated, with a loss of about fifty taken prisoners. The Federal loss was reported two killed and ten wounded."

## Historical Context

This September 1862 war report from the Alexandria Gazette documents an artillery skirmish at Fall's Church during the Civil War. The report is brief, noting that the skirmish resulted in "no damage." This minor military encounter occurred during a critical period of the Civil War in Virginia:

1. The Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28-30, 1862) had just concluded about a week earlier
2. The Maryland Campaign, which would culminate in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, was underway
3. General George B. McClellan had recently been restored to command of the Army of the Potomac

The report mentions Confederate forces under Generals Jackson, Ewell, Longstreet, and Walker operating along the upper Potomac. These were major components of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, which was moving north into Maryland at the time. The artillery skirmish at Fall's Church likely represented probing actions or minor encounters between advance units or patrols.

The document illustrates how Falls Church found itself in a contested area during the Civil War, with both Federal and Confederate forces operating in the vicinity.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This September 1862 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in earlier documents:

1. **Wartime Consistency**: Despite the disruptions of the Civil War, the spelling "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe persists in this 1862 reference, showing remarkable consistency with earlier usages from 1802, 1839, and 1860.

2. **Military Reporting**: As a military report concerning actual operations, this document likely reflects formal naming conventions used in military records and maps, suggesting "Fall's Church" remained the recognized designation for the location.

3. **Mid-Civil War Context**: This September 1862 reference comes approximately a year and a half into the Civil War, providing evidence that the apostrophe usage continued throughout the early war period.

4. **Publication Continuity**: The consistent use of the apostrophe in multiple issues of the Alexandria Gazette across different years (1839, 1860, and now 1862) demonstrates editorial consistency in the paper's treatment of the name.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1862 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Extended Apostrophe Timeline**: This document further extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" through 1862, spanning six decades (1802-1862) of consistent usage across multiple sources.

2. **Military Geography**: The identification of Fall's Church as a location of military significance during the Civil War demonstrates its established identity as a recognized place in Virginia.

3. **Historical Narrative Enrichment**: The war reference adds complexity to the historical narrative of the area, showing its involvement in the Civil War - a dimension that could be incorporated into educational materials related to the renaming initiative.

4. **Official Military Usage**: The mention in the context of military operations suggests the name "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe was used in official military communications and reporting.

This 1862 war report adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall) even during the tumultuous period of the Civil War.
