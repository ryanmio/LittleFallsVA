# Snakebite Incident Near Little Falls

## Transcription

"Monday last, a Mr. Gann, who resides in Virginia, while bathing in the Potomac, near the little Falls, was bitten by a snake. In a short time not only his leg was almost incredibly swollen, but his whole side turned to a hue almost black. Two or three physicians were procured from this city, and were promptly on the spot, but when our informant left, there was no abatement of the swelling or pain."

## Historical Context

This brief news item from August 1854 reports on a serious snakebite incident that occurred at "the little Falls" of the Potomac River. The victim, identified only as "Mr. Gann," was a Virginia resident who was bitten while bathing in the river. The severe symptoms described (extreme swelling, discoloration) suggest the bite may have been from a venomous snake, likely a copperhead or timber rattlesnake, both of which were native to the region.

The incident highlights several aspects of mid-19th century life in the region:

1. The Potomac River, including the Little Falls area, was used for recreational activities such as bathing
2. The natural environment still posed significant dangers to residents
3. Medical response involved physicians traveling from the city (likely Washington or Alexandria) to attend to patients in outlying areas

## Significance for the Little Falls Name

This 1854 newspaper reference provides additional evidence of the widespread use of "little Falls" as a geographical designation in Northern Virginia during the mid-19th century:

1. **Casual Reference**: Like the 1862 fishing notice, this brief news item mentions "the little Falls" without further explanation, indicating it was a well-known location to readers.

2. **Navigation Point**: The location is used as a primary reference point to indicate where the incident occurred, suggesting it was a recognized landmark.

3. **Recreational Use**: The mention of bathing adds to our understanding of how the Little Falls area was used by local residents.

4. **Cross-Newspaper Consistency**: This reference in the Alexandria Gazette complements similar references in other newspapers like The Star, showing consistent usage across different publications.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1854 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Timeline Expansion**: This 1854 mention fills a gap in our documented timeline of "Little Falls" usage, falling between the 1853 bridge construction reference and the 1862 fishing notice.

2. **Virginia Connection**: The specific mention that Mr. Gann "resides in Virginia" creates a direct connection between Virginia residents and Little Falls as a location they frequented.

3. **Geographical Reference**: The consistent use of Little Falls as a geographical reference point in news reporting demonstrates its established status in regional geography.

4. **Public Familiarity**: The casual reference in a news item intended for general readership indicates that "little Falls" was the standard, publicly recognized name for this location in 1854.

This brief news item adds another data point to our growing collection of evidence showing that "Little Falls" was the established, recognized name for this geographical feature throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.
