# Guerrilla Visit to Government Farm at Falls Church

## Transcription

"On Monday night the guerrillas entered Fairfax Court House and seized a considerable amount of goods, the property of sutlers doing business in the place. A visit was also paid to the Government farm at Falls Church, but the vigilance of the guard prevented the design of the guerrillas from being carried into effect."

## Historical Context

This brief notice from the October 7, 1863 edition of the Alexandria Gazette reports on Confederate guerrilla activity in Northern Virginia, specifically mentioning two locations:

1. Fairfax Court House, where the guerrillas successfully seized sutlers' goods
2. The Government farm at Falls Church, where their plans were thwarted by vigilant guards

This account comes from a period when Confederate guerrilla warfare was intensifying in Northern Virginia. Following major Confederate defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, Confederate irregular forces like Mosby's Rangers increasingly focused on harassing Union supply lines, attacking isolated outposts, and conducting raids behind Union lines.

The reference to a "Government farm at Falls Church" is particularly interesting, as it reveals an aspect of Union military operations in the area not mentioned in previous reports. During the Civil War, the Union Army established farms in occupied territories to supply food for troops and horses. These facilities were strategically important and thus became targets for Confederate raiders.

The guerrilla activity reported in this notice likely occurred on October 5, 1863, as the newspaper is dated October 7, and the event is described as happening "On Monday night" (Monday would have been October 5).

This report comes less than two months after the August 16 raid by Mosby detailed in the August 19, 1863 issue of the same newspaper, suggesting that Falls Church and the surrounding area remained contested territory and a frequent target for Confederate operations throughout the fall of 1863.

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This October 7, 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern observed in the July 15 and August 19, 1863 issues of the Alexandria Gazette, using "Falls Church" without the apostrophe. This consistent usage over a period of nearly three months indicates that by autumn 1863, the non-possessive form was becoming standardized in this newspaper, though variations still appeared in other contexts.

Key observations about this reference:

1. **Continued Standardization**: The consistent use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe in the Alexandria Gazette from July through October 1863 suggests a deliberate editorial choice or evolving convention.

2. **Institutional Recognition**: The reference to a "Government farm at Falls Church" shows that the non-possessive form was being used in official or semi-official contexts, not just in casual reporting.

3. **Geographical Identity**: Falls Church is referred to as a distinct location comparable to Fairfax Court House, indicating its established status as a recognized community with strategic importance.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This October 1863 reference provides additional support for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Naming Evolution Confirmation**: The continued use of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe from July through October 1863 shows the standardization of the modern spelling was occurring gradually throughout the Civil War period.

2. **Historical Significance**: The mention of a Government farm establishes Falls Church as a location of military importance during the Civil War, with infrastructure that supported Union operations in Northern Virginia.

3. **Community Identity Development**: By October 1863, Falls Church was clearly recognized as more than just a church building - it was an established location with government facilities and sufficient strategic importance to warrant Confederate attention.

4. **Documented Name Transformation**: When viewed alongside earlier references, this October 1863 mention adds to the body of evidence showing how the name evolved from "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) over time.

This continued documentation of the name's evolution throughout 1863 reinforces the central argument that place names naturally change to reflect shifting historical and cultural contexts. Just as "Fall's Church" gradually transformed to "Falls Church" during the Civil War period, the proposed change to "Little Falls, VA" represents another evolution that reconnects the community with its original geographical identity.
