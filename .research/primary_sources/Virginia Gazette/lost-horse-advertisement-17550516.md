## Notes

This advertisement from the Virginia Gazette in 1755 is one of the earliest documented references to "Fall's Church" in Fairfax County, predating the American Revolution by over twenty years. The church referenced was likely The Falls Church, which was established as a wooden structure in 1733 and later rebuilt in brick in 1769. This indicates that the area was already known as "Falls Church" in local usage well before the community formally adopted the name.

The advertisement follows a common colonial format for lost or recovered livestock, with John Hurst following legal procedures to announce a found horse and offering its return to the rightful owner upon payment of fees as prescribed by colonial law.

Notable details include:
- The spelling "the Fall's Church" with the possessive apostrophe
- Reference to Fairfax County, which at that time was much larger than its current boundaries
- Detailed description of the horse using period terminology ("Ham dock'd" refers to the horse's tail being shortened or docked)
