# N. Va. School Officials Sift Negro Transfer Applications

Northern Virginia desegregation applications probably will total more than 130, sources indicated today. Deadline for transfer applications under local pupil assignment plans was yesterday, but Arlington and Fairfax officials have yet to make an official tally of the number of Negroes seeking transfer to white schools.

However, this was the picture as of this morning:

• In Fairfax County, 63 applications have been filed by Negro attorney Otto L. Tucker and another 20 or so have come in from individual Negro pupils, according to Assistant Supt. George Pope.

• In Arlington, approximately 50 Negroes are applying for white schools, a source outside the school system estimated. Arlington School Supt. Ray E. Reid.
