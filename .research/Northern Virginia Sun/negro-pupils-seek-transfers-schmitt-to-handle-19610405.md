# 83 Negro Pupils Seek Transfers

Some 83 Negro students have applied for transfers to predominantly white schools in Fairfax county, county pupil placement officer George Pope reported today. Today is the deadline for public school students to apply for school transfers in Arlington and Falls Church, which have adopted local pupil assignment plans, and in Fairfax, where county supervisors were expected to approve an emergency local assignment plan at their today's session. 

POPE SAID that he had received "quite a stack" of transfer applications from Negro students, including 63 applications filed by Alexandria Negro attorney Otto Tucker acting in behalf of a group of students seeking transfers. An additional 20 applications had come in from individual Negro students, Pope estimated. 

Pope said that a report on which schools the Negro students wish to attend probably would be withheld until next week, to allow time for processing the applications. 

TWO NEGRO children have applied for entrance into white schools of Falls Church - a six-year-old boy who wishes to enroll in James Madison Elementary's first grade and a 12-year-old girl seeking a transfer to the 10th grade of George Mason High School. Falls Church, which has never operated a Negro school, has sent Negro pupils to Fairfax county schools in the past under a long-standing agreement with the county.

In Arlington, no figures were available on the yet-unprocessed applications for school transfers. County pupil placement officer Howard Boyce has estimated that some 30 transfer applications are awaiting processing, including applications from both Negro and white students.

The April 5 deadline for transfer requests is written into the General Assembly's "freedom of choice" school legislation, which gives localities the option of making their own school assignments. Transfer applications for Alexandria schools will continue to be processed by the State Pupil Placement Board, in Richmond.

# Schmitt to Handle Pupil Placements

FALLS CHURCH - The school board last night designated Supt. Irvin H. Schmitt as its agent to make all initial placements of Falls Church school pupils, including two Negro children who have applied for admission to the city's all-white school system. 

Schmitt said that before making a decision on placement of the two Negro children he will review their applications. A six-year-old Negro boy is seeking placement in the first grade of the city's Madison Elementary School and a 15-year-old Negro girl has asked to be placed in the 10th grade of George Mason High School. 

Schmitt indicated the applications would be approved, saying "They have to be accepted unless there is some reason (in the pupil placement law) for not accepting them." Schmitt was uncertain whether action would be taken on the applications this week.

OVER THE objections of School Board Member H. P. Strople the board decided not to enter into placement matters unless appeals are made to the board by parents. Strople favored deferring action on placement of the two Negro pupils until Supt. Schmitt submitted his recommendations to the board. Strople said that if the pupils are rejected "you won't get an appeal from parents it will go right into court. The school board, not the superintendent, is subject to suit," he said.

The applications mark the first time Negroes have applied for admission to Falls Church schools. Falls Church has no Negro schools in its system. Under a 12-year-old agreement with Fairfax County, Falls Church pays the county full tuition costs for educating the city's 32 Negro students in county schools. The city's Negro pupils traditionally have applied voluntarily to Fairfax County schools. 

About 20 persons attended last night's board meeting. Supt. Schmitt said he has not had any reaction from parents over the probability of integration in two of the city's four schools.
