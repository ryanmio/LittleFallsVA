# Fairfax's Dismissal Plea Filed

By HANK BURCHARD

FAIRFAX —A Fairfax County motion for dismissal of Falls Church's suit to annex 4.5 square miles of county land was passed over by the special three-judge annexation court yesterday. Circuit Court Judge Arthur W. Sinclair of Fairfax, acting as spokesman for the court, said the bench "prefers to delay ruling on the motion" until both sides have been heard.

FALLS Church yesterday completed its six-day presentation of testimony purporting to show that annexation of the territory sought "is necessary and expedient," would not "permanently injure the county," and "would greatly benefit the people in the annexable area by giving them urban government and services."

Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney Robert C. Fitzgerald's motion to dismiss the suit, on the grounds that Falls Church which as plaintiff bears the burden of proof has not built a case, was expected. The County's defense, which started late yesterday, is expected to take about two weeks.

The court refusal to act immediately on the motion was apparently designed to strengthen the decision in the higher courts to which the case will certainly be appealed no matter which side wins.

In making his dismissal motion yesterday, Fitzgerald asserted Falls Church witnesses "have given this court many opinions, but they have not been backed up by acts."

"(FALLS Church planning consultant Julian) Tarrant, the city's one witness, told this court the Seven Corners Shopping Center has no community of interest with Falls Church and would not be affected if the city disappeared."

"On the other hand, he admitted the city could not afford to annex the western areas it seeks unless it took Seven Corners on the east to pay for it."

"The city says it can provide urban-type services to the annexable area which the county cannot. Yet in almost the same breath the city's witnesses admit they provide only one service—water—to the area, and make a tidy profit on that. The court will also note that the city says their water company is considered to be, and is taxed as, a private business."

"Falls Church has no hospital. It has no parks. Its police force would not serve even to police Seven Corners alone. Its fire department was set up and is regulated by the county. We help train the city police."

"THEY have no jail, no colored school, no program for health and welfare services for the area."

"It is plain that the city has gerrymandered the proposed annexation boundary to include that which is a tax-rich plum and exclude that which is a tax liability," Fitzgerald said.

Falls Church attorney Robert McCandlish rebutted that the city is prepared to spend $77,600 to establish police protection for the area, $10,000 for street cleaning, and more than $100,000 for street repairs and lights. "The boundary line is proper and we have shown substantial evidence that it is," McCandlish said.

"The statute doesn't require that annexation be in the best interests of the area annexed," he said.

"The county would recover the loss in population and revenues within a year," he asserted.

"NECESSITY for annexation has been shown by Tarrant's testimony that only 129 vacant acres will be left in the city when the building permits outstanding are discharged."

"Whereas it might appear at first blush that Seven Corners is a tax-rich plum, we will show it isn't," McCandlish said.

The Falls Church attorney was referring to a late exhibit entered by the city which shows that the tax return from Seven Corners and adjacent areas dropped nearly $19,000 from 1960 to 1961.

Associate Fairfax counsel Frank L. Ball Sr. rose to add that "the city has not presented a single witness to endorse the plan who is not paid by Falls Church."

"The county has entered a petition by 23,178 residents outside the area who oppose the annexation, and 2,177 in the annexation area have come to join with Fairfax as intervenors in the suit."

"The city started a community of interest survey, but something happened to it—it was never made public or shown to this court."

"I know what happened to it and why it wasn't brought here, or wasn't finished."

"It showed that there is no significant community of interest between the people in the annexation area and the city. Those people don't want to become part of Falls Church."
