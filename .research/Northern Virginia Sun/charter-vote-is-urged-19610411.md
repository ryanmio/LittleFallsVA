# In Falls Church  
# Charter Vote Is Urged  

FALLS CHURCH – A seven-member charter review committee has recommended a referendum in the June 13 city election to determine whether two major changes should be made in the city charter.  

In an initial report to the City Council last night, the charter committee suggested that the controversial question of whether the city attorney should be elected or appointed be taken to the voters because of a "difference of opinion in the city" on the issue.  

**THE POST** formerly an appointive one, became elective through a 1951 referendum during a local political fight.  

In another change, the charter revision committee proposed removal of a controversial provision that requires a majority of freeholders (property owners) to approve any bond issue. The report recommends that this proposal also be submitted to referendum in June.  

A $1.2 million bond issue approved by a slim majority of freeholders last November is being challenged in Fairfax Circuit Court on grounds that some freeholders were not allowed to vote as property owners because of errors in the voting list.  

**THE REVISION** also would eliminate a required 5-vote council majority in adoption of bond ordinances. In 1957 a minority of the council was able to block a proposed school bond referendum because of the five vote provision.  

The report calls for public hearings in the fall to air six minor changes recommended by the committee.  

The proposal would:  

- Delete a description of detailed boundaries of the city.
- Specify that the city charter take precedence over general state law.
- Clarify duties of the city clerk.
- Set forth three methods of amending the charter – by voters' petition to the council, by referendum, or by resolution of a majority of the council. The provision conforms to the state law.
- Delete a provision calling for submission of work plans by city departments to the city manager.
- Eliminate a provision requiring ordinances for capital projects. The revision also would clarify procedures for five-year capital programs.  

Committee chairman Lee M. Rhoads said the charter review group will continue its study of the 10-year-old city charter and compile other reports.
