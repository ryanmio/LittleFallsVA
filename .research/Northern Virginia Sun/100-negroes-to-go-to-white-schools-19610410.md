# 100 Negroes to Go To White Schools

ARLINGTON — About 100 Negro children automatically will be assigned to predominantly white schools under the Arlington School Board's local placement plan.

These children, who live in the attendance areas of white schools, are among about 120 Negroes to request transfer to new schools, according to Pupil Placement Officer Howard Boyce.

FINAL figures on the number of transfer applications are not yet available, Boyce said. He estimated that an exact count would be made by Tuesday or Wednesday.

The latest Arlington estimate brings to more than 200 the total number of Negro children who have applied for white and desegregated schools in Northern Virginia. About 80 Negroes have applied in Fairfax, and three in Falls Church, where schools are still segregated.

Boyce said that about 175 transfer applications have been received from Negro and white pupils. About 50 of the applications come from white pupils seeking transfer to new white schools.

ABOUT 20 of the Negro transfer applications were made by pupils residing in the Hoffman-Boston (Negro) school area, and because of the geographic criterion they will be denied transfer to the school for which they requested transfer, Boyce said.

Under Arlington's recently adopted placement plan, Negro children living in attendance areas of white schools are given a choice of attending the school in their area or the Negro school they previously attended. School officials earlier estimated that about 150 were eligible for transfer under this rule.

Boyce said that two more white schools would be desegregated under this plan — Gunston and Swanson junior high schools.

Of the approximately 100 eligible transfers, 30 will be admitted to Swanson, 20 to Stratford Junior High, 20 to Patrick Henry Elementary, 13 to Washington-Lee Senior High, 12 to Thomas Jefferson Junior High, and 4 to Gunston, Boyce said.

Forty Negro children now are attending six previously all-white schools under federal court order. This is the first time that Arlington has admitted Negro pupils to white schools without court orders.

For the past five years, all pupil assignments were made by the State Pupil placement Board. But under Virginia's "freedom of choice" program and under rules established recently by the State Board of Education, localities were again permitted to handle their own assignments if they chose to do so.

Alexandria is the only Northern Virginia locality still having its assignments made by the State Placement Board.
