# Biracial Athletics Expected
# Board Approval Seen in Arlington

ARLINGTON - The chairman of the Arlington County School board indicated today that interscholastic athletics will be integrated in the county school system this fall.

Mrs. Elizabeth Campbell said that while no formal action has been taken, some Negroes are trying out for Arlington athletic teams and she is certain they will be allowed to compete.

The right of Negroes to compete in Arlington's integrated system is now pending in a suit before a federal court. The board was informed yesterday it will be some weeks before the matter is legally decided.

Mrs. Campbell said the question will be placed on the agenda of a September meeting for official action. She said no opposition is expected from any of the board members.

Although Arlington schools have been desegregated since 1959, Negroes have never been allowed to compete in athletic contests between county schools. Last spring the board eased its policy concerning integrated athletics to allow Negroes from other jurisdictions to compete against Arlington schools. This happened as a result of action by Fairfax County when it withdrew its integrated track team from a regional meet held here.

Arlington will not be the first to integrate athletics, Mrs. Campbell said. Integrated competition is already allowed in Norfolk as well as Fairfax.

## Research Notes

This article provides significant insights into the process of school integration in Northern Virginia:

1. **Incremental integration process**: The article illustrates how integration happened in stages - Arlington had integrated classrooms since 1959, but athletic programs remained segregated until 1961, showing that full integration was a gradual process with different aspects of school life being integrated at different times.

2. **Comparative regional progress**: While Arlington led the way in classroom integration (1959), they lagged behind Fairfax County in athletic integration. This reveals the complex and uneven nature of desegregation across Northern Virginia jurisdictions.

3. **External pressure as catalyst**: Arlington's movement toward athletic integration was accelerated by Fairfax County's decision to withdraw its integrated track team from a meet in Arlington - demonstrating how jurisdictions influenced each other and how integration often required external pressure.

4. **Legal backdrop**: The pending federal court case about athletic integration shows how legal processes continued to shape integration efforts even after initial classroom desegregation had begun.

5. **Strategic timing**: Published in late August 1961, this article appeared just as the 1961-62 school year was about to start, which would be the first school year with integrated classrooms in Falls Church (based on earlier reports from April-June 1961).

This article helps establish a more complete timeline of desegregation in Northern Virginia:
- Arlington integrated classrooms in 1959
- Fairfax integrated athletics before Arlington (by spring 1961)
- Falls Church was preparing for its first integrated classroom experience in fall 1961
- Athletic integration lagged behind classroom integration by approximately 2-3 years
