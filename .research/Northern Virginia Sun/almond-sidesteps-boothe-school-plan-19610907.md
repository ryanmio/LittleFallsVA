# Boothe's Plan Gets Brushoff

RICHMOND (AP) - A suggestion by State Sen. Armistead L. Boothe of Alexandria aimed at reopening the closed public schools of Prince Edward County has drawn a discreet sidestep by Gov. J. Lindsay Almond Jr.

Almond said yesterday that in view of the "critical state of litigation" in the Prince Edward case, he considered "it the better part of wisdom to refrain from comment."

Boothe's proposal would make available to the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors some $330,000 in funds already appropriated for the county schools in the current biennium which have not been used up.

IN A LETTER he wrote Boothe, Almond said, "I do not wish to do or say anything which would occasion embarrassment to the courts, state or federal, or to counsel of record." The governor said "I am sure you are aware that legal complications are involved at the executive level. These circumstances would seem to indicate care and caution on my part."

Boothe said adoption of his plan "would obviate any further effect of the most recent federal court decree" Federal Judge Oren R. Lewis' ruling that the county cannot use tuition grants or tax credits to finance private segregated schools as long as the public schools remain closed.

ACCORDING to Boothe, public schools would be open to the Negroes and the private schools would remain for the white children. Negroes have had no formal education since Prince Edward closed its public schools in 1959 to avoid court-ordered desegregation. White students have attended private schools financed mainly until this year by the tuition grants and tax credits. Negroes have rejected such a school system.

# Almond, Byrd Set For Rally

Virginia's two top politicians and government leaders Gov. J. Lindsay Almond and Sen. Harry F. Byrd will attend a political rally Monday night in Arlington.

The two men—whose relations have been strained since Gov. Almond scrapped Byrd's "massive resistance" to integration—will speak at a gathering at the home of H. Bruce Green, Arlington Clerk of Court.

Principal speaker at the event, scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. at 1107 N. Barton St., will be Albertis S. Harrison, who won the Democratic nomination for Governor in the July primary.

Sen. Byrd will deliver the welcoming speech and Gov. Almond will introduce Harrison. The public is invited.

The event is a traditional one started 36 years ago by Green's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Harry K. Green, and continued by them for the purpose of kicking off the gubernatorial campaign in Northern Virginia every four years.

Green's father died a decade ago but his widow, known affectionately to thousands as "Ma" Green, carried on the tradition. Mrs. Green died last year and her son, Bruce, announced last week he would carry on the tradition.

More than 1,000 persons are expected to attend the event.
