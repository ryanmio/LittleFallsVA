# Candidates Argue Whisper Charges In Falls Church

FALLS CHURCH – The Falls Church council campaign, which has been touted as the quietest in years, has been reduced to a whisper.

At least whispers are what door-to-door canvassers of Candidates for a Better City (CBC) have told the candidates they uncovered during their work to drum up votes.

AND THE reported whispers have provoked a sharp retort from Mayor Charles M. Hailey on behalf of his CBC running-mates—Councilmen Samuel Dennis and Harold Silverstein, and Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones.

And they drew an equally sharp disclaimer from the four men opposing the CBC slate in today's election for four council seats—Lewis P. Jones, Archie T. Munson, E. Don Rockey Sr., and Francis W. Trapp.

Hailey said the whispers go like this: that upon election, the CBC candidates would fire Harry Wells, city clerk, and Don Frady, director of public works.

"These are last-minute desperation tactics in which city employees are being used as pawns" (in the campaign). He said the two men were held in "high regard" by the CBC for their "outstanding" contributions to the community.

"We call upon all candidates to repudiate this talk. We vigorously deny these unwarranted charges and protest such insinuations," the mayor's statement said.

THE FOUR candidates opposing the CBC slate likewise denied knowing anything about the rumors, and lashed at any insinuations the independents were behind them.

Lewis P. Jones said, in answer to the mayor's statement: "That (the rumor) sounds most ridiculous. It sounds like something the CBC dreamed up" as a campaign issue.

Munson termed the mayor's rumor report "like name-calling. They run out of arguments and call names to put you on the defensive."

Trapp said that "from time to time I've heard rumors, but I haven't given them any credence. We certainly haven't circulated them."

ROCKEY said he knew nothing at all about any rumors of firings. He added, however, that if proposed changes in the city charter are approved, any city council would have "autocratic power" to do anything it wanted to.

Two proposed changes will be on the ballot Tuesday:

To change the city attorney's post from an elective to an appointive one.

To eliminate a provision which now requires, on bond referenda, majority of both freeholders (property owners) and the total vote. The change would require a simple majority of all voters, without distinguishing between them.

Two candidates are also in the running for city attorney, a post for which City Attorney Philip Brophy is not running. The candidates are LaRue VanMeter and G. William Hammer.
