# In Falls Church
# CBC Wins Over Independents

By DOROTHY HERTZ  
SUN Correspondent

FALLS CHURCH - In a convincing victory, the non-partisan Citizens for a Better City (CBC) yesterday won control of the City Council for four years with the election of its four-man slate to the Council.

Mayor Charles M. Hailey led the CBC ticket with 937 votes. Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones ran second with 906 votes. Incumbent councilman Samuel J. Dennis polled 858 and incumbent Harold Silverstein, 823.

IN A NECK-AND-NECK race, former city attorney LaRue Van Meter won the job of city attorney over assistant city attorney G. William Hammer with 763 votes to Hammer's 686. It was Van Meter's fourth try for the job. He had been defeated in the last three city elections for the post.

Losing candidates in the Council race were "independents" Archie Munson, with 646 votes; Lewis P. Jones with 642; Francis Trapp, 608, and E. Don Rockey, 585.

Total vote cast was 1,528 of the city's 3,000 registered votes.

The CBC ticket established an early lead in all four wards and never ran behind. The CBC slate ran on its two-year record of "good government", continuing improvement of the school system, qualified appointments to boards and commissions and open discussion of public business.

The fiscally conservative "independents" charged the CBC with "bossism" and "free spending" during the campaign.

ORGANIZED TWO YEARS ago, the CBC broke up a controlling Council majority in 1959 with the election of a three-man slate. Through appointments it has gained a 6 to 1 majority on the Council. With yesterday's election it will control all seven Council seats when the Council is reorganized in September.

Hailey, 52, a Falls Church real estate broker, has been mayor since 1959 and was elected to a four-year Council term in 1957. He was the 1959 president of the Northern Virginia Real Estate Board. A new member of the CBC, he has joined with three CBC councilman on major issues in the last two years.

Dennis, a statistician with the Bureau of the Census, was appointed to the Council in March to fill the vacancy left by Charles Kellogg, who resigned. Dennis was a City Council member in 1948-49 and served on the town council and town planning commission from 1945 to 1948. One of the founders of the CBC, he is a past president of the George Mason PTA.

Jones, 45, has been a member of the Falls Church Planning Commission for seven years and its chairman since 1957. He is Chief of the Technical Library at Engineer Research and Development Laboratories at Fort Belvoir. He was an early member of the CBC.

Silverstein, 43, special assistant to the chief signal officer, Department of Defense, was appointed to the Council in January to fill a vacancy left by former mayor, Thomas A. O'Halloran.

One of the founders of the CBC, he is past president of the North Greenway Downs Citizens Association and past president of the Thomas Jefferson PTA.

The three other CBC Council members, elected two years ago, are Vice Mayor Lee M. Rhoads and Councilmen Charles Hedetniemi and Everett Johnston.

# Stephens, Harrison Split On Prince Edward School Plan

Lt. Gov. A. E. S. Stephens and former Atty. Gen. Albertis S. Harrison expressed totally different views yesterday on whether or not the state could reopen Negro schools abandoned two years ago in the face of court-ordered desegregation.

White students in Prince Edward have attended private schools under a "freedom of choice" tuition grant setup since public schools were closed in 1959. But Negroes have refused grants and have had little or no formal education.

THE ISSUE was considered almost certain to be brought up again tonight when the candidates debate for the second time in Norfolk. They debated once before in the campaign at Richmond.

Stephens said in Martinsville yesterday "the legislature could authorize reopening of schools in Prince Edward County and you would still have your 'freedom of choice' to deal with school desegregation."

Harrison, at a press club luncheon in Richmond, said "the state is completely without statutory authority to operate schools in the county."

Stephens said students who did not wish to attend integrated schools could "accept a grant and go to a private school." "We must not deny one single child in Virginia the right to a free public school education," he said.

HARRISON said there was "no such thing as opening a 'Negro school' in Prince Edward... and this Mr. Stephens knows.

"For the state to go into Prince Edward County to operate schools with state funds would be a completely revolutionary change in Virginia.

"Take over a locality's public school system... other localities would want the state to assume the same financial burden."

State Sen. Armistead L. Boothe, Stephens' running mate for lieutenant governor, was the first of the candidates to mention reopening of schools for Prince Edward Negroes.

Hardly had Stephens lent support to the suggestion when state Sen. Bill Stone, a Harrison supporter, entered the dispute.

Stone issued a statement saying: "I now call on 'GI' Stephens to withdraw as a candidate... he is only a captive candidate who takes orders from 'Army' Boothe... Boothe now sets policy without consulting Stephens."

Stephens had a prepared speech to deliver at Martinsville later in the night, but discarded the text to answer Stone's charge. "There is not, a scintilla of truth in what has been uttered," he said.

HE CALLED Stone "one who would attack unjustifiably and falsely to carry out a point." T. Munford Boyd, candidate on the Stephens' ticket for attorney general, said he was "greatly impressed" by Stone's statement.

"It leaves no 'Stone' unturned," he said. "But gentlemen, there's a 'Stone' I'd like to turn... I'd like to turn him over my knee and spank him, and I'm old enough to do it. He's behaving like a spoiled brat rather than like the dignified state senator which his office suggests he should be."
