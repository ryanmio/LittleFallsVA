# Inside Falls Church

# City's Political Pot Is Perking

By DOROTHY HERTZ  
SUN Staff Writer

Politics is becoming the consuming topic of interest in Falls Church as the filing deadline (April 14) for the June 13 city election nears.

Seven candidates have filed for the four City Council seats that will be up for election. A petition is being circulated on behalf of Planning Commission member E. Don Rockey, who is expected to announce shortly as an eighth candidate.

THREE independent candidates for the council — Francis Trapp, Archie Munson and Lewis P. Jones — will campaign against a four-man Citizens for a Better City slate which includes Mayor Charles Hailey, Councilman Harold Silverstein, Planning Commission Chairman Thomas R. Jones and former councilman Sam Dennis. Rockey is expected to follow suit as an independent candidate.

Speculation is that the campaign will be a typically hard-hitting one, revolving around an impending tax increase and the perennial issue of how much money the city should spend on its schools.

THE INDEPENDENT candidates are considered far more fiscally-conservative than the CBC, which was born two years ago primarily to push for better schools and specifically for a school bond referendum which had been rejected by the City Council in 1957 and 1958. The CBC won three Council seats in its first political endeavor in 1959 with the election of Charles Redfetierni, Everett Johnston and Lee M. Rhoads to four-year terms. CBC gained a five-man Council majority with the appointment of Silverstein to Thomas O'Halloran's unexpired term and with the membership of Mayor Hailey.

Independent candidate Trapp was a founder and president of the Falls Church Taxpayers League which was formed last fall for the purpose of defeating the long-delayed bond issue. Following passage of the $1.2 million bond issue in November, the Taxpayers League contested the election. The suit is still pending in Fairfax Circuit Court.

Falls Church's annexation suit for 4.5 square miles of surrounding Fairfax County territory is not contemplated as a campaign issue, since the court and council decisions probably will be concluded before a new council takes office in September.

TWO CANDIDATES are in the race as independent for City Attorney — LaRue VanMeter, who was town and city attorney from 1945 to 1951 and William Hammer, who has been assistant city attorney since 1959.

There is considerable guessing about whether the five CBC councilmen on Monday will name one of the four CBC Council candidates to fill the unexpired term of Charles Kellogg. The term, one of the four up for election in June, ends August 31. Other seats up for election are held by incumbents Hailey and Silverstein and Charles Seymour, who has given no indication that he will seek re-election.

SURPRISING MISCELLANY: All the adjacent residents to the Risemman tract on W. Broad Street are in favor of a proposed luxury apartment on the property, a project contingent upon a rezoning coming up for City Council action. The Westbrook Gardens apartment project back of the Risemman property went before the Planning Commission and or City Council 33 times over a period of several years before it was approved.
