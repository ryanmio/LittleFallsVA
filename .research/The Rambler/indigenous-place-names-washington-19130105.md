# Indigenous Place Names in the Washington Region

## Transcription

"Indian Names.

The memory of the Indians who lived in the region around Washington is preserved for all time in the names of the numerous creeks and rivers. The spelling of these names by the whites has been various, but it is clear that the names of these places as spoken by the Indians sounded to the European [...] very like that expressed by the letters with which we have come to spell these strange and in many instances romantic names.

Near Washington is Dogue creek, which runs through the Mt. Vernon lands and on which George. Washington's mill and the miller's house stood. There are Accotink creek and Accotink bay, the creek also flowing through the Mount Vernon lands, especially through that part of the Mt. Vernon estate which was sold by Lorenzo Lewis, son of Nellie Custis-Lewis, and which about 1850 came to be settled by members of the Society of Friends from New Jersey. Close by Accotink are Pohick creek, Pohick bay and Pohick Church, the church of the Washingtons of Mount Vernon, the Fairfaxes of Belvoir and the Masons of Gunston Hall. A little below Pohick bay, which helps to form Gunston cove, are Occoquan creek and Occoquan bay. It is into Occoquan creek that [...] run flows.

Below Occoquan and flowing through Prince William and Stafford counties into the [...] river are the creeks Maramsco, [...], Quantico, on which the rains of the early city of Dumfries lie, and Chapawamsic. Chapawamsic is a so the name or one of the largest and worst swamps in the vicinity of Washington, and ail these Washingtonians who have traveled through [...] going by wagon road from Washington to Fredericksburg, particularly between Dumfries and Stafford Court [...], will know that no exaggeration lies under the adjectives 'largest' and 'worst.' [...] creek is another of the Indian-named waterways, and so is Accokeek, which flows into Potomac creek, which flows into the Potomac river.

Below Washington in King Georges county there is Passapatanzy, and another [...] run, which empties into the [...] river. There is Metomkin point, the side of Mathias point, and there is [...] creek. In [...] county there is Occupacia creek; in Caroline flow the [...] and the [...], and in Westmoreland are the Pedee, [...], [...] with [...] , and the [...], dividing [...] from Northumberland.

Flowing into the Potomac through [...] Maryland are the [...], the [...] the [...], the Chickomuxen. The Port [...] and the Nanjemoy. There are [...] creek and Kakiah swamp and [...] creek. Chaptico creek and bay pour into the [...], and [...] creek flows into St. Clement bay. There is [...] point in the Wicemico.

Above Washington is Pimmitt run. which courses down through the Virginia [...] and enters the Potomac at Chain Bridge. A little farther along is Seneca run, which adds itself to the Potomac just above Blockhouse point in Montgomery county.

In the region around Washington are the Patuxent and the Patapsco, the Monocacy, Catoctin creek and the Catoctin mountains, Ogequon creek, Shenandoah, Cacapon, [...] creek, Antietam, Conococheague and Massanutten mountains.

This list of Indian names near Washington could be multiplied many times by giving sufficient application to this interest subject."

## Historical Context

This January 5, 1913 article from "The Rambler" column provides valuable insight into the indigenous geographical naming patterns that predated European settlement in the Washington region, including areas near what would later become Falls Church. The article documents numerous waterways and geographical features that retained their indigenous names despite centuries of European settlement, highlighting the enduring indigenous legacy on the region's geography.

The article specifically mentions several waterways in relative proximity to Falls Church, including:

1. **Pimmitt Run** - "which courses down through the Virginia [...] and enters the Potomac at Chain Bridge" - This stream is just a few miles from Falls Church and represents one of the closest indigenous place names to the community

2. **Dogue Creek** - Named for the Dogue (also called Taux) people who were among the indigenous inhabitants of Northern Virginia

3. **Accotink Creek** - A significant waterway in Fairfax County, flowing not far from Falls Church

4. **Pohick Creek** - Another major Fairfax County waterway with an indigenous name

These waterways formed part of the indigenous geographical understanding and usage of the area that would later include Falls Church, connecting the region's history to the peoples who inhabited it long before European settlement.

## Significance to Falls Church History and the Little Falls Connection

This documentation of indigenous place names provides important context for understanding the pre-European history of the Falls Church area and strengthens the connection to the "Little Falls" geographical designation:

1. **Pre-European Naming Patterns**: The article demonstrates that indigenous peoples had established names for geographical features throughout the region, including streams, creeks, and falls, which were later adopted (with varying spellings) by European settlers

2. **Falls as Landmarks**: The presence of named runs, creeks, and rivers throughout the region suggests that distinctive geographical features like falls would have been significant landmarks and likely had indigenous names as well

3. **Connection to "Little Falls"**: While this article doesn't specifically mention "Little Falls," it establishes that natural features in the region typically retained names with indigenous origins or connections, suggesting that "Little Falls" may have been recognized as a significant geographical feature by indigenous peoples before European settlement

4. **Layered Naming History**: The article reveals how place names in the region reflect multiple layers of history - indigenous names adopted by early European settlers, which sometimes gave way to later European designations (like "Falls Church")

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This article on indigenous place names provides valuable supporting context for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Deep Historical Roots**: The name "Little Falls" connects to a deeper layer of regional history that predates the church and community, placing it within the context of indigenous geographical understanding

2. **Naming Evolution Precedent**: The article documents how European settlers both adopted indigenous names and introduced their own naming patterns, establishing a historical precedent for the natural evolution of place names over time

3. **Geographical Truth**: The emphasis on waterways and geographical features as the basis for place names supports the argument that "Little Falls" reflects the area's actual geographical reality and historical identity

4. **Cultural Reconnection**: Reconnecting with the geographical name "Little Falls" represents a form of historical acknowledgment similar to the article's recognition of the indigenous naming legacy in the region

When added to our existing timeline, this 1913 reference enriches our understanding of the layered naming history of the region, showing that the proposed shift to "Little Falls, VA" not only reflects the documented Civil War-era naming evolution but also potentially reconnects with an even deeper layer of regional geographical understanding.
