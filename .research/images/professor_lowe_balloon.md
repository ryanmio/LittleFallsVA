## Description

This illustration from Harper's Weekly depicts Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe making an ascent in his observation balloon "Intrepid" during a reconnaissance mission near Vienna, Virginia, in 1861. The image shows Union soldiers and officers gathered around as the balloon is prepared for launch, with Lowe apparently in the basket ready to ascend.

Lowe was the Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, the military aeronautical unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War. His balloons provided valuable reconnaissance information about Confederate troop movements, positions, and fortifications. This innovation represented one of the earliest military uses of aerial observation in American warfare.

The scene takes place in Fairfax County, as Vienna was a strategically important location during the early stages of the Civil War due to its proximity to Washington D.C. and key transportation routes. The illustration captures a moment that demonstrates the Union Army's technological innovations and intelligence-gathering methods during the conflict.

## Historical Context

Professor Lowe conducted numerous reconnaissance missions over Fairfax County and northern Virginia during 1861-1862. The balloons allowed Union commanders to observe Confederate positions from heights of up to 1,000 feet, gathering crucial intelligence about troop movements and fortifications.

The Union Army Balloon Corps was the first military aeronautical unit in American history. Though they operated for only two years (1861-1863), they conducted important aerial reconnaissance operations during the Peninsula Campaign and other Civil War engagements.

Vienna, Virginia, where this particular ascension took place, was the site of one of the war's earliest engagements in June 1861, when Confederate forces ambushed a Union train. The town remained strategically important throughout the war due to its location on the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad.
