# Ruby Lee Minar: Real Estate Developer and Segregation Enforcer in Falls Church 

Understood. I’ll investigate Ruby Lee Minar’s role as a real estate developer in Falls Church during the 1920s–30s, focusing on both her enforcement of racially restrictive covenants and her significance as a pioneering woman in a male-dominated industry. I’ll return with a full, journalistic profile suitable for the Little Falls public history site.

# The Woman Who Built a Falls Church Suburb – and Kept It Segregated

In the late 1920s, Falls Church’s outskirts were transformed by an unlikely real estate mogul: **Ruby Lee Minar**, one of the few women in the male-dominated development industry of that era. Minar was a former schoolteacher turned entrepreneur who became so successful that a 1929 business review hailed her as the “most successful woman in realty development in the country” ([Women’s Work: Ruby Lee Minar](https://library.arlingtonva.us/2018/11/07/womens-work-ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%2C%20entrepreneur%20Ruby,%E2%80%9D)). From her base in Washington, D.C., Minar bought up a 109-acre dairy farm just outside Falls Church and carved it into a new neighborhood called **Greenway Downs**, marketing affordable home sites to middle-class buyers streaming out of the city ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Ruby%20Lee%20Minar%20%2C%20a%C2%A0very,in%201927%20for%20Greenway%20Downs)) ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Mrs,20%C2%A0got%20its%20name%20in%201927)). But woven into Minar’s suburban vision was a harsh exclusion: the properties came with **racially restrictive covenants** barring Black people and other non-white residents ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Her%20sales%20agreement%E2%80%94posted%20by%20the,%E2%80%9D)). Minar’s story – as a pioneering businesswoman and a purveyor of segregation – reveals how power, race, and gender collided in the making of Falls Church’s modern landscape.

## From Dairy Farm to “Greenway Downs”

In 1927, Ruby Lee Minar set her sights on Falls Church at a time of booming suburban growth. The recent opening of Key Bridge and the expansion of Lee Highway into Fairfax County suddenly made rural land more accessible to Washington commuters. Sensing opportunity, Minar purchased the bankrupt Tripp family farm (109 acres along Lee Highway) and immediately subdivided it into hundreds of residential lots, capitalizing on the surging demand for new housing ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Ruby%20Lee%20Minar%20%2C%20a%C2%A0very,in%201927%20for%20Greenway%20Downs)). She even held a naming contest – complete with a cash prize – to brand her development, ultimately choosing the name “Greenway Downs” in June 1927 ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Mrs,20%C2%A0got%20its%20name%20in%201927)). Advertised as a neighborhood for the **“person who does not want to pay more than $1,000 or $1,500 for his home site, but who demands much the same surroundings as... a high-priced subdivision,”** Greenway Downs promised suburban comfort at a moderate price ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Mrs,20%C2%A0got%20its%20name%20in%201927)).

 ([Photos from the Past | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/pictures-from-the-past)) *Minar’s real estate office in Greenway Downs – a six-room bungalow on Lee Highway – was built in just one month in 1927 as the hub for selling lots ([Microsoft Word - RLM 7-10-1927.docx](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/979c4476-06ac-4a1c-b8e0-3abedcf53df4.pdf)). The building (pictured above in a 1927 news photo) still stands today as the American Bird Company pet shop on Route 29 ([Photos from the Past | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/pictures-from-the-past#:~:text=1927%3AImage%20Ruby%20Lee%20Minor%20built,7to%20see%20the%20full%20article)).*  

Minar’s salesmanship was as modern as her vision. She ran eye-catching newspaper ads and weekend promotions to lure city dwellers to Greenway Downs. In the first three weeks of sales, **40% of the initial 200 lots were snapped up** by buyers from D.C. and Virginia ([Microsoft Word - RLM 7-10-1927.docx](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/979c4476-06ac-4a1c-b8e0-3abedcf53df4.pdf#:~:text=The%20%20%20%20,placed%20%20on)). On July 4, 1927, Minar hosted a community picnic and field day on the property, giving out prizes to children – a publicity stunt that drew crowds and press attention ([Microsoft Word - RLM 7-10-1927.docx](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/979c4476-06ac-4a1c-b8e0-3abedcf53df4.pdf#:~:text=been%20%20%20%20on,placed%20%20on)) ([Microsoft Word - RLM 7-10-1927.docx](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/979c4476-06ac-4a1c-b8e0-3abedcf53df4.pdf)). Street names and even home design ideas were crowdsourced through contests, reflecting Minar’s knack for community-driven marketing ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=On%20a%20grander%20scale%20was,sides%20of%20South%20Washington%20St)). By all accounts, **Greenway Downs was taking off**: “lots sold like hotcakes,” the local history archive notes, until an abrupt reversal in 1929 ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Mrs,20%C2%A0got%20its%20name%20in%201927)) ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Also%20unfortunately%20%28for%20Mrs,Click%20here%20to%20learn%20more)). The onset of the Great Depression brought Minar’s booming business to a “screeching halt” ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Also%20unfortunately%20%28for%20Mrs,II%20and%20the%C2%A0new%20demand%20for)). Banks foreclosed on her holdings, and another developer eventually took over many unsold parcels. Greenway Downs would not fully build out until the 1940s, but Minar’s imprint – the street layout, the name, and the concept – was already in place ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Also%20unfortunately%20%28for%20Mrs,Click%20here%20to%20learn%20more)).

## “White Only” Covenants in a New Suburb

While Ruby Minar touted Greenway Downs as an idyllic new community, she ensured it would be a **whites-only enclave** from the start. Every lot she sold came with a restrictive covenant in the purchase agreement explicitly **forbidding sale or lease to Black buyers** ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20the%20covenant%20to%20purchase,to%20get%20this%20language%20removed)). The language was stark: *“Neither said property nor any part thereof nor any interest therein shall be sold or leased to a negro or a person of negro descent.”* ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Her%20sales%20agreement%E2%80%94posted%20by%20the,%E2%80%9D)). In the 1920s, such **racial covenants** were common tools of segregation, and Falls Church was no exception. Researchers have uncovered exclusionary clauses in the deeds of some **1,000 properties** in and around Falls Church from that era ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=ago)). Greenway Downs, along with nearby subdivisions like Woodland, carried these covenants that created an invisible color line through the community ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Language%20in%20sales%20agreements%20that,Greenway%20Downs%20and%20Woodland%20neighborhoods)) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)). Minar – along with a D.C. realty lawyer named Harry Birge – was one of the key local players implementing this practice to “segregate Falls Church” in housing ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=In%20Falls%20Church%2C%20two%20key,been%20told%20it%20is%20feared)).

Not everyone was silent about these racist practices. As early as 1915 (a decade before Greenway Downs), Falls Church’s Black civic leaders had begun pushing back against housing segregation measures. In that year, local civil rights pioneer **Edwin B. Henderson** wrote an open letter challenging developers who sought to bar African Americans. “We would like to know your reasons for favoring this... legislation,” Henderson pointedly asked, adding that *“we have been told it is feared by you that colored people may buy property near you and other white residents and thereby lower the value of your property.”* ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=letter%20to%20Birge%20and%20partner,%E2%80%9D)) His bold questions – directed at Birge and others behind a proposed segregation ordinance – underscored the prejudice driving these efforts. (That ordinance was defeated by Black activism, in a case that helped spark the first rural branch of the NAACP on nearby Tinner Hill.) But while zoning-based segregation was struck down by the courts in 1917, **private covenants remained legal**. By the time Minar was developing Greenway Downs in 1927, there was no law to stop her from writing racial exclusions into every deed.

For two decades, the covenants did their work. No Black families were able to live in Greenway Downs; the neighborhood’s very creation had displaced the remaining African American presence on that land. (Notably, the area south of Falls Church had historically included a Black community, which the town **intentionally cut off in 1887** to reduce Black political influence ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=In%20between%C2%A0Silas%20Tripp%27s%20purchase%20and,Click%20here%20to%20learn%20more)).) It was not until **1948**, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such covenants unenforceable, that the legal grip of these clauses began to loosen. Yet even after **Shelley v. Kraemer** outlawed enforcing racial covenants, the offensive language lingered on paper. In fact, Falls Church’s own 1912 ordinance enforcing “whites only” housing remained on the books until **1998** (though rendered void much earlier) ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Asked%20to%20respond%2C%20Edwin%20Henderson,Falls%20Church%20books%20until%201998)). And the Greenway Downs deed clauses, while null today, technically stayed in many house titles for decades – a hidden reminder of segregation. Only in 2020 did Virginia pass a law making it easier for homeowners to formally remove the vestiges of racist covenants from their deeds ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=Moon%20agrees%20that%20modern,%E2%80%9D)).

## A Woman in a Man’s World

Minar’s role in Falls Church history is complex: she wielded **social power as a female trailblazer** even as she reinforced racial hierarchies. In the 1920s, it was extraordinarily rare for a woman to lead a real estate development company, yet Ruby Lee Minar built an empire. Starting with a $200 investment in 1919, she launched her own firm in Washington, D.C., and soon expanded into Northern Virginia’s suburbs ([Ruby Lee Minar](http://arlingtonwomenshistory.org/2018/11/ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%2C%20entrepreneur%20Ruby,%E2%80%9D)) ([Ruby Lee Minar](http://arlingtonwomenshistory.org/2018/11/ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=The%20following%20year%2C%20Minar%20opened,sights%20on%20Arlington%20for%20development)). By 1929, she had offices in D.C. and Arlington and a sales force of 20 men and women selling house lots in multiple subdivisions ([Ruby Lee Minar](http://arlingtonwomenshistory.org/2018/11/ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=Land%20in%20Lyon%20Park%20had,of%20property%20in%20Lyon%20Park)). Her success earned her national fame. She became the **first woman admitted to the Virginia Real Estate Association** and the only female member of the Alexandria-Arlington-Fairfax realty board in her time ([Women’s Work: Ruby Lee Minar](https://library.arlingtonva.us/2018/11/07/womens-work-ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=Ruby%20Lee%20Minor%20was%20a,Fairfax%20Real%20Estate%20Board)). She was also a champion for businesswomen: in 1922 Minar was elected as the **first president of the Washington, D.C. Soroptimist Club**, a pioneering women professionals’ organization, and later rose to be the Soroptimists’ first national president ([Women’s Work: Ruby Lee Minar](https://library.arlingtonva.us/2018/11/07/womens-work-ruby-lee-minar/#:~:text=Ruby%20Lee%20Minor%20was%20a,Fairfax%20Real%20Estate%20Board)) ([](http://soroptimistsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RLM_Brochure.pdf#:~:text=In%201922%2C%20Ruby%20Lee%20was,In%20that)). In an era when women often struggled to be taken seriously in business, Minar not only broke through the glass ceiling – she built a whole new house beyond it (literally). Neighbors recall that she was always referred to respectfully as “**Mrs. Minar**,” and she leveraged that status to navigate male-dominated circles with ease.

Yet Minar’s story also shows how **social privilege could cut both ways**. As a white woman developer, she exercised the power to include or exclude – and chose to perpetuate segregation. The same Falls Church where she wielded economic influence was home to Black families whose housing options were curtailed by covenants like hers. Minar likely saw no contradiction: she moved comfortably in elite circles (even serving as a director of an Arlington bank and hosting society events) ([](http://soroptimistsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RLM_Brochure.pdf#:~:text=teaching%20to%20real%20estate%20developer,Director%20of%20an%20Arlington%20bank)) ([Microsoft Word - RLM 7-10-1927.docx](https://greenwaydowns.org/files/documents/979c4476-06ac-4a1c-b8e0-3abedcf53df4.pdf#:~:text=been%20%20%20%20on,placed%20%20on)), and she embraced the era’s conventional wisdom that excluding non-white residents would protect property values. Her position as a pathbreaking woman did not translate into empathy for other marginalized groups – a reminder that **advancing one equality (gender) did not mean challenging other inequalities** of race.

## Legacy and Memory in Falls Church

Today, the physical legacy of Ruby Lee Minar’s venture is easy to find on the map. The **Greenway Downs** neighborhood endures as a leafy residential enclave along present-day Route 29 (Lee Highway) in Fairfax County adjacent to Falls Church. Many original 1920s lot lines and street names remain, and even a few structures from Minar’s development era survive – including the **real estate office bungalow** on Lee Highway and the old Oak Mount manor (now a private home) that she once refurbished as a tea room ([Photos from the Past | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/pictures-from-the-past#:~:text=1927%3AImage%20Ruby%20Lee%20Minor%20built,7to%20see%20the%20full%20article)) (["Oakmount" | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/-oakmount-#:~:text=,pictured%20in%20this%20%2023%C2%A0%C2%A0from%C2%A01929)). But the **story behind those homesites** was, for many years, largely omitted from public view. Local historical narratives celebrated Falls Church’s small-town charm and Civil War lore, while the uncomfortable fact that entire subdivisions were built with “*no Blacks allowed*” was seldom taught. As one Greenway Downs community leader noted, the neighborhood is proud of its history but “there are a lot of residents who may still not know about this unfortunate part of our history” ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=A%20similar%20reaction%20came%20from,%E2%80%9D)).

That is beginning to change. In recent years, historians and community activists have brought Minar’s covenants to light, prompting reflection on Falls Church’s segregated past. In 2023, a research team led by scholar **Krystyn Moon** and others combed through old land records and published their findings, shining a spotlight on deeds like Minar’s that **“denied access to disfavored groups”** ([Racist F.C. Past Unveiled In Land Covenants - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2023/02/03/racist-f-c-past-unveiled-in-land-covenants/#:~:text=eye,new%20subdivisions%20a%20century%20ago)). The Greenway Downs Citizens Association now openly acknowledges on its website that Minar’s purchase agreement *“included language that prohibited African Americans from purchasing land”*, and it even provides resources for homeowners to remove that legacy language from their deeds ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20the%20covenant%20to%20purchase,to%20get%20this%20language%20removed)) ([History | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/about#:~:text=land%20libraryarchives,to%20get%20this%20language%20removed)). The City of Falls Church, for its part, has officially recognized pioneers of Black civil rights like Henderson and the Tinner Hill activists with historical markers – indirectly underscoring the forces that opposed what developers like Minar put in place.

Minar herself moved on from Virginia after her Falls Church chapter. She weathered the real estate crash and in 1940 relocated to Florida, where she remained active in civic work until her death in 1952 ([](http://soroptimistsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/RLM_Brochure.pdf#:~:text=In%201940%2C%20Ruby%20Lee%20moved,Me%02morial%20Fund%20in%20her%20honor)). In Arlington, a **collection of her papers and photographs** is preserved in the local library archives ([Ruby Lee Minar the Real Estate Lady | Greenway Downs](https://greenwaydowns.org/ruby-lee-minar-the-real-estate-lady#:~:text=The%20Arlington%20Public%20Library%C2%A0has%20a,You%20can%20find%20it%20here)), attesting to her prominence in the region’s growth. In Falls Church, however, her name is not widely commemorated. There are no plaques bearing Ruby Lee Minar’s name in Greenway Downs, no street signs or civic awards – only the subtle imprint of a subdivision’s curving roads and lot lines that she laid out nearly a century ago. 

Understanding Minar’s legacy means **looking at it in full**. She was undeniably a visionary entrepreneur who blazed a trail for women in real estate, **proving that a “housewife” could reshape whole neighborhoods**. But she also helped draw the color lines that segregated Northern Virginia’s suburbs for decades. The little suburb she created stands today as a testament to both her ambition and the systemic racism of her time. By remembering Ruby Lee Minar in this dual light, Falls Church can better acknowledge how even *“The Little City”* was built on big contradictions – and how those past choices on **power, race, and gender** still echo in the community’s landscape and conscience.
