# Nicholas F. "Nick" Benton: Falls Church's Unapologetic Newsman and LGBTQ+ Trailblazer

Nicholas F. "Nick" Benton has spent decades shaking up the status quo in Falls Church. As the founder, owner, and editor-in-chief of the *Falls Church News-Press* – and the first openly gay newspaper publisher in Virginia – Benton has put inclusion and progressive values front and center ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Benton%20accepted%20the%20signed%20declaration,Don%20Beyer)) ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=In%20its%20masthead%2C%20the%20News,excerpts%20from%20the%20Clark%20book)). His life's journey spans early gay liberation activism in 1970s California to becoming a local institution in the small city of Falls Church. In profiling Benton, we find a fuller, more inclusive history of Falls Church itself: one marked by courage, controversy, and change.

## From 1970s Activist to Falls Church Resident

Benton's activist roots stretch back to the tumult of the late 1960s and early '70s. A native Californian, he came of age amid Berkeley's counterculture and the dawn of the gay liberation movement ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBenton%20remained%20in%20the%20Bay,fledgling%20gay%20newspaper%2C%20the%20Effeminist%E2%80%A6)). In 1969 – just as the Stonewall uprising ignited LGBTQ+ activism – Benton came out as gay and was already pushing boundaries in print. He wrote for the radical *Berkeley Barb* and penned the first editorial for *Gay Sunshine*, one of the earliest gay newspapers ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=from%20women%E2%80%99s%20liberation%20to%20rock,fledgling%20gay%20newspaper%2C%20the%20Effeminist%E2%80%A6)). He even co-published a small gay journal called *The Effeminist* during that era ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=launched%20the%20gay%20right%20movement,fledgling%20gay%20newspaper%2C%20the%20Effeminist%E2%80%A6)). Armed with a Master of Divinity from a progressive seminary, Benton saw journalism as a calling to advance social justice ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=principal%20writer%20for%20a%20legendary,gay%20and%20feminist%20movements%20raged)).

Those ideals traveled with him to the East Coast. Benton moved to Falls Church in 1985, at a time when this conservative-leaning suburb had no local paper and little visible LGBTQ+ presence ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=METRO%20WEEKLY%3A%20When%20you%20look,Church%2C%20what%20do%20you%20see)) ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Benton%20accepted%20the%20signed%20declaration,Don%20Beyer)). In March 1991, he launched the *Falls Church News-Press* essentially as a one-man operation, determined to give the "Little City" its own voice ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIts%20founder%2C%20Nicholas%20F,major%20influencer%20and%20talent%20nurturer)). As owner-editor, Benton set out to cover everything from City Hall to high school sports – and to infuse the paper with the inclusive ethos he'd championed out West. By Benton's account, something about Falls Church "made an impression" on him in '85, convincing this veteran newsman to put down roots and start an unorthodox community paper ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=match%20at%20L108%20connected%20to,apartment%20in%20which%20Benton%20played)) ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=METRO%20WEEKLY%3A%20When%20you%20look,Church%2C%20what%20do%20you%20see)).

## An Openly Gay Voice in a Changing Community

Being openly gay in Falls Church's public life was virtually unheard of in the early 1990s. Benton changed that. He ensured his newspaper was not just locally focused but proudly LGBTQ+-owned and inclusive in outlook. The *News-Press* masthead declares it "an award-winning LGBT-owned general interest community newspaper" – a bold statement in a region where LGBTQ+ residents often stayed closeted at the time ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=In%20its%20masthead%2C%20the%20News,excerpts%20from%20the%20Clark%20book)). As the paper's chief editor, Benton wrote every weekly editorial himself and frequently tackled gay rights and diversity topics that other local outlets ignored ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=2019%20on%20the%2050th%20anniversary,Lethe%20Press%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%202013)). He later reflected that he saw it as his mission "to basically open up Falls Church to more progressive thinking, embracing diversity" ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=match%20at%20L178%20I%20see,more%20progressive%20thinking%2C%20embracing%20diversity)).

Over the years, Benton's *News-Press* created sustained LGBTQ+ visibility in Falls Church through both news coverage and community initiatives. Notable actions and milestones include: 

- **Supporting LGBTQ+ Youth:** In 1993, the *News-Press* **editorially backed** students at George Mason High School who decided to run a supportive ad for SMYAL (the Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League) in the school paper – a move that was *highly controversial* at the time ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=On%20the%20LGBTQ%2B%20front%20here%2C,5%29%20ran)). Benton praised the student editors' courage in an era when acknowledging gay youth was taboo.  
- **Publishing LGBTQ+ Voices:** The paper hosted a weekly column by gay activist **Wayne Besen** (titled "Anything But Straight") for about six years in the early 2000s ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=highly%20controversial%20at%20the%20time%2C,part)) ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=News,%E2%80%9D)). This regular column on queer issues – something skeptics claimed a suburban paper "could never do" – signaled that LGBTQ+ perspectives had a place in Falls Church's public square.  
- **Defending Coming-Out Stories:** Benton's *News-Press* printed an op-ed by a Falls Church middle schooler about his experience coming out, sparking weeks of debate ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=BENTON%3A%20,up%20on%20it%20as%20well)). The piece drew a flood of letters both supportive and hostile – including objections from a prominent local "ex-gay" activist – but Benton stood by the student writer. He answered critics in his editorials and ran multiple pro– and anti– op-ed letters, forcing the community to confront prejudice openly ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=ad%20in%20the%20high%20school,this%20kid%20and%20the%20paper)) ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=including%20from%20one%20of%20the,this%20kid%20and%20the%20paper)). Many residents, in turn, voiced strong support for the brave student and the paper's stance.  
- **Public Forums on LGBTQ+ History:** Benton also helped bring national LGBTQ+ pioneers into local conversation. In 2001, he organized a public forum featuring gay rights icons **Frank Kameny** and **Lilli Vincenz** at a Falls Church coffee shop ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Youth%20Advocacy%20League,historic%20Falls%20Church%20Episcopal%20in)). Years later, in 2019, the *News-Press* co-sponsored a forum on the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, held at a local church, to educate and connect residents with LGBTQ+ history ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=forum%20featuring%20gay%20pioneers%20Frank,part)).  
- **Editorial Advocacy:** Through it all, Benton penned countless editorials championing LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion in local institutions ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=2019%20on%20the%2050th%20anniversary,Lethe%20Press%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%202013)). He even wrote a 100-part online column series called "Nick Benton's Gay Science" analyzing queer identity and society, later compiled into a book *Extraordinary Hearts* ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=2019%20on%20the%2050th%20anniversary,Lethe%20Press%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%202013)). His outspoken voice earned him recognition beyond Falls Church – he was named an "OUTstanding Virginian" by Equality Virginia in 2012 and a Capital Pride "Hero" in 2014 ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=the%20Progress%20of%20Civilization%E2%80%9D%20,Press%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%202013)) ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=columns%20that%20were%20published%20on,version%20of%20my%20%E2%80%9CExtraordinary%20Hearts%E2%80%9D)).

## Challenging the Status Quo – and Stirring Controversy

Benton's unapologetic approach inevitably ruffled feathers. As an out gay editor pushing progressive views, he often found himself at odds with conservative elements in the community – particularly in the 1990s when Falls Church's institutions were not used to public discussions of gay rights. The *News-Press*' support for the gay student ad in 1993, for example, angered some parents and traditionalists who felt Benton was injecting unwelcome "social issues" into local schools. Later, the paper's publication of the middle-schooler's coming-out essay drew sharp backlash from a local religious ex-gay group, which flooded Benton's inbox with condemnations ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=ad%20in%20the%20high%20school,this%20kid%20and%20the%20paper)). Benton did not back down. In weekly editorials he "slugged it out" with critics, defending LGBTQ+ youth and asserting that *all* residents deserved representation ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=including%20from%20one%20of%20the,this%20kid%20and%20the%20paper)).

 ([image]())Benton's clashes with the powerful *Falls Church Episcopal* church also became front-page news. In the early 2000s, that historic church's congregation split in protest after the national Episcopal Church ordained an openly gay bishop ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=Then%20I%20went%20through%20a,a%20pitched%20battle%20with%20them)). A majority of the Falls Church parish – aligning with a conservative Anglican diocese – even occupied the church property for years rather than accept gay inclusion ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20an%20openly,throughout%20and%20provided%20ongoing%20editorial)). Benton, who saw the schism as intolerance, used his paper to shine a spotlight on the dispute ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=match%20at%20L456%20an%20openly,throughout%20and%20provided%20ongoing%20editorial)). He ran investigative pieces and scathing editorials depicting the breakaway faction as "big bullies in town who try to foist their will on the rest of the community" ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=Then%20I%20went%20through%20a,a%20pitched%20battle%20with%20them)). This did not endear him to certain religious circles. Yet it reinforced the *News-Press*' stance that Falls Church could not ignore discrimination happening in its midst.

Amid these controversies, Benton earned both ire and admiration. Some labeled him a provocateur or "wild-eyed liberal," but others thanked him for speaking up. "There were no burned crosses on my lawn" in response to the paper's gay-friendly content, Benton quipped, noting that by the time his regular gay columnists appeared, "everybody in town knew" where he stood ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=MW%3A%20What%20other%20feedback%20have,gotten%20regarding%20%E2%80%9DAnything%20But%20Straight%E2%80%9D)) ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20the%20Wayne,affairs%20column)). Over the years, he noticed far more citizens would quietly approach him around town to express **appreciation** for the *News-Press* and its principled stands ([Citizen Nick - Metro Weekly](https://www.metroweekly.com/2007/08/citizen-nick/#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20the%20Wayne,affairs%20column)). Even those who didn't agree with Benton's opinions came to respect the little newspaper's presence. As Falls Church Mayor Dave Tarter put it, the *News-Press* is something "everyone reads… whether you love it or hate it," and it undeniably contributes to a shared community dialogue ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20News,Press%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D)).

## Civic Involvement Beyond the Newsroom

Benton's imprint on Falls Church isn't confined to journalism. He has actively involved himself in civic affairs, leveraging his platform to influence the city's direction. In the *News-Press*' infancy, Benton served two consecutive terms as president of the Falls Church Chamber of Commerce in the early 1990s ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=Third%2C%20the%20City%E2%80%99s%20tax%20base,zoned%20areas%20of%20the%20City)). In that role he helped bridge local businesses with the wider community, even organizing a Chamber-backed consensus to support increased school funding – a *"watershed moment"* that signaled businesses and educators could collaborate for the public good ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=the%20needy%20distribution%20program%20out,development%20that%20began%20in%20the)) ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=Chamber%20of%20Commerce%E2%80%99s%20endorsement%20of,began%20in%20the%20early%202000s)). Benton was twice honored by the City Council as "Business of the Year" (in 1991 and 2001) for his contributions through the paper and Chamber ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=The%20Falls%20Church%20News,going%20on%20a%20dozen%20times)).

As a civic booster, Benton has consistently advocated for what he views as smart growth and inclusive progress in Falls Church. Decades before it was fashionable, he championed affordable housing and denounced racial and social inequities in city policies ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=All%20along%2C%20for%20example%2C%20we%E2%80%99ve,of%20Falls%20Church%20and%20Environs)). He also pushed the once-sleepy city to embrace development projects that would expand the tax base to fund schools and public amenities ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%99s,It%20took%20time)) ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=Third%2C%20the%20City%E2%80%99s%20tax%20base,zoned%20areas%20of%20the%20City)). From early battles like the so-called "Taco Wars" over a proposed fast-food restaurant in the 90s, to recent debates on dense mixed-use projects, Benton and his paper often took a pro-development stance, arguing that controlled growth would benefit Falls Church's future ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=sold%20to%20the%20University%20of,businesses%20and%20the%20wider%20community)) ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=The%20City%20of%20Falls%20Church%E2%80%99s,It%20took%20time)). This sometimes put him at odds with "traditionalists who treasure the residential village" feel of Falls Church ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBenton%20knows%20the%20key%20players%2C,at)). But Benton has maintained that a more welcoming, modern Falls Church can still honor its small-town roots while being open to diversity and change.

In addition, Benton has put his money and name toward community betterment. As an openly gay philanthropist, he established the **Nicholas F. Benton Diversity Affirmation Education Fund** in the 2010s, donating $10,000 to support anti-bullying programs at Falls Church schools ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=For%20one%2C%20I%20being%20as,for%20a%20number%20of%20years)). The fund sponsored annual "Challenge Day" workshops at the high school to foster empathy and combat harassment, directly impacting local youth culture ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=For%20one%2C%20I%20being%20as,for%20a%20number%20of%20years)). Through the *News-Press*, he also launched scholarships for students pursuing careers helping the disenfranchised, and even organized free "Day at the Ballgame" outings to bring the community together at high school sports events ([A Short History of The Falls Church News-Press' First 30 Years - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2021/08/02/a-short-history-of-the-falls-church-news-press-first-30-years/#:~:text=For%20another%2C%20starting%20in%20our,baseball%20team%20for%20a%20day)). These efforts highlight Benton's broader vision of civic journalism – using the newspaper as a tool to educate, engage, and uplift the community beyond just reporting news.

## A Complicated Legacy in an Evolving Falls Church

After more than 1,700 weekly editions of the *Falls Church News-Press*, Nick Benton has become a fixture in the city's public life ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=The%20News,miles%20from%20the%20White%20House)). He is the rare editor who can be found at nearly every City Council or School Board meeting, chronicling the minutiae of local governance ([New book chronicles founding of gay-owned Falls Church News-Press](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/02/24/falls-church-news-press-book-review/#:~:text=the%20occasional%20battles%20with%20traditionalists,%E2%80%A6)). In 2022, the City of Falls Church formally recognized Benton's contributions by asking him to accept the official Pride Month proclamation on behalf of the LGBTQ+ community ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Our%20founder%2C%20owner%2C%20editor,%E2%80%9D)) ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Benton%20accepted%20the%20signed%20declaration,Don%20Beyer)). Standing at City Hall, Benton – once the lone "out" activist in Falls Church – could see how far the community had come. The proclamation honored "the meaningful, long-lasting impacts that LGBTQ+ people have made" in Falls Church and celebrated building "a culture of inclusiveness and acceptance" ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=David%20Tarter%20to%20accept%20the,%E2%80%9D)). It was a full-circle moment for a journalist who, thirty years earlier, had to fight to get even a small ad supporting gay youth published in town.

Importantly, Benton's role in Falls Church's story is not without controversy or limits. He has not endorsed the current **"Little Falls" renaming movement**, which seeks to change the city's name to detach from its church-centric, colonial origins. Benton, a historian at heart, has thus far stood by the established name "Falls Church," preferring to focus on progress *within* the community rather than rebranding it. In fact, he has often written about honoring local history (for instance, supporting moves to name schools after civil rights heroes) but also cautioned against gestures that might divide residents. While he has not supported the renaming effort, Benton's long presence in the Little City nonetheless speaks to its evolving identity. The Falls Church of 2025 is far more diverse, outspoken, and inclusive than the Falls Church of 1985 – thanks in no small part to voices like Benton's that were willing to challenge conventions.

As a self-described "gay pioneer" and indefatigable newspaperman, Nick Benton embodies both the progress and the tensions in Falls Church's modern history ([Benton Accepts F.C.'s Pride Proclamation - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/05/25/benton-accepts-f-c-s-pride-proclamation/#:~:text=Benton%20accepted%20the%20signed%20declaration,Don%20Beyer)). He arrived as an outsider with bold ideas, and over three decades he became an insider who still isn't afraid to be *"unpopular"* in service of the truth ([Editorial: Benton Feted in Editor & Publisher - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2024/06/12/editorial-benton-feted-in-editor-publisher/#:~:text=Asked%20%E2%80%9CWhat%20are%20some%20of,%E2%80%9D)) ([Editorial: Benton Feted in Editor & Publisher - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2024/06/12/editorial-benton-feted-in-editor-publisher/#:~:text=printer%E2%80%99s%20ink%20in%20my%20veins%2C,what%20brings%20you%20the%20greatest)). Benton's story reminds us that local history is shaped not only by founders and famous names, but by those who prod their hometown to live up to its ideals. Falls Church's journey from a "closeted" community to one that raises the Pride flag each June is, in many ways, the story of Nick Benton writ large. And whether or not one agrees with him on every issue, his impact on this small city's narrative is indelible – a testament to what one devoted citizen-editor can achieve in pursuit of a more open and unified community.
