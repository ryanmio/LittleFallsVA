# Account of Randolph-Clay Duel Near Little Falls Bridge

## Transcription Excerpt (Relevant Portion)

The meeting was to take place on the right bank of the Potomac, near the Little Falls Bridge, and within the edge of the Virginia line, which there approaches near to the river. Mr. Randolph had chosen it himself. He wished, if he fell, to fall upon the soil of Virginia; and as he did not mean to fire at Mr Clay, he felt it to be no infraction of her statute against duelling, to go within her limits for the mere purpose of receiving the fire of his adversary. His words to me were: I break no law of Virginia. I neither accept a challenge within her limits, nor do I fight a duel within them. The seconds on both sides had agreed that I might be at hand, when the meeting took place, for the purpose of interposing my mediation at the first practicable moment. Availing myself of this permission I followed on behind the parties, crossed the Little Falls Bridge just after them, and came to the place where the servants and carriages had stopped.

## Historical Context

This 1826 account, written by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, describes the famous duel between Secretary of State Henry Clay and Senator John Randolph of Virginia. The duel, which took place on April 8, 1826, arose from harsh criticism Randolph had made of Clay in a Senate speech. Although both men fired, neither was seriously injured, and they reconciled immediately afterward.

The document provides valuable insights into the code of honor that governed political disputes in early America, as well as the complicated legal and geographical considerations that went into planning such encounters. Dueling was illegal in most states, including Virginia, which is why the specific location for this high-profile duel required careful consideration.

Most significantly for geographical research, the document specifically identifies "Little Falls Bridge" and the "right bank of the Potomac" as recognizable landmarks, establishing that "Little Falls" was a well-known and commonly referenced geographical location in the Washington area by 1826.

## Significance of "Little Falls" Reference

This 1826 document contains several important geographical references:

1. **Little Falls Bridge** - The explicit naming of this bridge demonstrates that "Little Falls" was an established geographical designation used for navigation and reference.

2. **The Virginia Line** - The document notes the Virginia boundary approaching the river near Little Falls, showing the geographical and political significance of the area.

3. **Right Bank of the Potomac** - The technical geographical description indicates familiarity with the Little Falls area's topography.

The account establishes that by 1826, "Little Falls" was:

1. A sufficiently prominent geographical feature to have a bridge named after it
2. A recognized landmark for giving directions
3. A place with enough significance that a U.S. Senator would choose it specifically as the location for what might have been his final moments

This reference demonstrates that "Little Falls" was not merely a minor geographical designation but a recognized and significant place name in the early 19th century, used by prominent political figures and understood by the reading public.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1826 document provides additional historical evidence supporting the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Early Usage**: This reference to "Little Falls" predates the 1839 "Fall's Church" vestry notice and the 1802 "Fall's Church road" mention, demonstrating that "Little Falls" was an established geographical name in the region before the church name became prominent in written records.

2. **Geographic Primacy**: The document shows that the "Little Falls" name was tied to a significant geographical feature (the falls on the Potomac) that was prominent enough to have infrastructure (a bridge) named after it.

3. **Historical Connection**: The connection of this location to a famous historical event involving prominent national figures (Clay and Randolph) adds cultural and historical weight to the "Little Falls" name.

4. **Washington Area Reference**: The document establishes "Little Falls" as a recognized location in the broader Washington area, supporting the argument that the name has regional historical significance.

This 1826 reference to "Little Falls" provides evidence that the geographical feature was prominent enough to serve as a landmark and reference point in the early 19th century, strengthening the case that "Little Falls" has deep historical roots in the region's geography and would be an historically appropriate choice for renaming Falls Church.
