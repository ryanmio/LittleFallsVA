# Rev. Thomas Jefferson Costner and Marian Costner Selby: Civil Rights Pioneers in Falls Church

Reverend **Thomas Jefferson Costner (1895–1971)**, also known as Rev. Wallace E. Costner, was a long-serving pastor of Falls Church’s historically Black Second Baptist Church and a prominent local civil rights advocate ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=Both%20men%20were%20leaders%20in,Mason%20High%20School%20in%201964)). During the 1940s and 1950s, he worked alongside educators **Dr. Edwin Bancroft “E.B.” Henderson** and **Mary Ellen Henderson** to challenge segregation in public institutions – from schools to libraries – in the City of Falls Church ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=The%20Mary%20Riley%20Styles%20Public,access%20had%20previously%20been%20limited)). His daughter, **Marian Costner Selby (b. 1946)**, would herself make history as the first Black student to attend the all-white Falls Church high school in 1961 and the first to graduate in 1964 ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=served%20as%20minister%20at%20the,Mason%20High%20School%20in%201964)). Together, Rev. Costner and Marian Selby played pivotal roles in advancing educational equity and civil rights in Falls Church, Virginia.

## Reverend Costner’s Civil Rights Leadership

Rev. Costner became pastor of Second Baptist Church (located on what is now Costner Drive, named in his honor) in the early 1930s and served there until his death in 1971 ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Costner%20is%20the%20daughter%20of,40%20years%20before%20his%20death)) ([M.E.

A vital part of the community, he was widely respected as a compassionate leader who “would go out of his way to help any person in the community” regardless of who they were ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Among%20those%20in%20Falls%20Church,to%20her%20own%20first%20child)). Beyond his pastoral duties, Costner emerged as a vocal advocate for his congregation’s civil rights and political interests ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=But%20along%20with%20supporting%20his,the%20schools%20they%20paid%20for)). In the 1950s – as the fight against Jim Crow segregation intensified – he used his pulpit to “lead the charge,” preaching that Black residents who paid taxes in the city *“should attend the schools they paid for”* ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=But%20along%20with%20supporting%20his,the%20schools%20they%20paid%20for)). This stance aligned with a broader local movement, led by pioneers like E.B. and Mary Ellen Henderson, demanding equal access to quality education and public resources for Falls Church’s Black citizens.

 ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/)) *African-American teacher and students at the segregated Falls Church “Colored School,” early 20th century. Black children in Falls Church had to attend a small, underfunded segregated school for decades.* Falls Church’s Black community endured separate-and-unequal schooling well into the 20th century. The city’s only “colored” school was a two-room building (established in the 1880s by Quakers) with outdoor privies and a coal stove for heat ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=One%20bright%20spot%20occurred%20in,the%20classes%20heat%20in%20winter)). Mary Ellen Henderson served as principal of this school and documented its woeful conditions – noting in 1938 that only *2.6%* of Fairfax County’s school funds went toward Black students, versus *97.4%* for white students ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=A%20model%20teacher%20in%20Washington%2C,the%20schools%20educating%20White%20students)). Armed with such facts, the Hendersons and Rev. Costner pushed for improvements. Their efforts helped pressure officials to replace the ramshackle “colored” school with the modern James Lee Elementary in 1954 – the first new school for African Americans in the county ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=Armed%20with%20this%20information%2C%20she,in%20Fairfax%20County%20Public%20Schools)). Even then, Black high schoolers from Falls Church still had to travel out of the city to attend segregated schools. Rev. Costner and his allies believed this situation was unjust and began agitating for desegregation of the city’s own school system ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=But%20along%20with%20supporting%20his,the%20schools%20they%20paid%20for)).

The fight for equality in Falls Church also extended to public amenities. In **autumn 1955**, Rev. Costner joined E.B. Henderson in a notable effort to desegregate the **Mary Riley Styles Public Library**, which at the time limited or denied access to Black residents ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=The%20Mary%20Riley%20Styles%20Public,access%20had%20previously%20been%20limited)) ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=Correspondence%20and%20minutes%20preserved%20in,these%20Black%20students%20as%20well)). The two men met with the head librarian to discuss “the matter of the library’s service to the colored people of Falls Church” ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=Correspondence%20and%20minutes%20preserved%20in,Falls%20Church%20%E2%80%93%20who%20attended)). At a November 10, 1955 library board meeting, Costner and Henderson proposed that Black children in Falls Church – who, because of segregation, were attending school outside the city – be granted the same library privileges as the city’s white students ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=the%20librarian%20of%20Falls%20Church,led%20to%20the%20decision%20to)). The library’s Board of Trustees agreed unanimously to open its services to those Black students ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=the%20colored%20people%20of%20Falls,led%20to%20the%20decision%20to)). Further discussions led to extending library access to the (mostly Black) teachers of those students as well, a change conveyed in a letter from the librarian to Rev. Costner ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=the%20Black%20school%20outside%20the,from%20the%20librarian%20to%20Costner)). This quiet but significant victory meant that African-American youth in Falls Church could finally use the public library’s books and resources, marking an early step toward integration of public accommodations in the city. By advocating persistently for such changes, Rev. Costner helped lay the groundwork for the broader integration of Falls Church’s schools and facilities in the years to come.

## Marian Costner Selby: Integrating Falls Church High School

In **1961**, Falls Church City Schools cautiously moved to comply with the Supreme Court’s *Brown v. Board of Education* mandate and ended its policy of all-white schooling ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=%281961,City%20until%20the%20early%201960s)). That September, Marian Costner – Rev. Costner’s teenage daughter – enrolled as a 10th-grader at **George Mason High School**, becoming the first Black student in the city’s school system ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=served%20as%20minister%20at%20the,Mason%20High%20School%20in%201964)). (A handful of other Black children were admitted into the lower grades around the same time.) Marian had spent her freshman year at the all-Black Luther Jackson High in Fairfax County, where she had been a popular, high-achieving student involved in many clubs and activities ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Costner%20said%20that%20going%20from,she%20had%20been%20very%20popular)). Transferring to white Falls Church High, she found herself completely alone – “the one black student” in a school of hundreds ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Right%20in%20the%20City%20of,and%20forget%20about%20equal%20rights)). It was understood within her family that Marian would be a pioneer. Rev. Costner and his wife asked if she was willing to be the one to integrate the school, but for Marian “the choice was already made” – she felt it was her duty ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Costner%20said%20that%20she%20remembers,she%20was%20supposed%20to%20do)). (Activism ran in her blood: her biological great-grandfather was Joseph Tinner, a founding member of Falls Church’s first NAACP branch in 1915 ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=For%20Rev,branch%20in%20the%20organization%E2%80%99s%20history)).) Still, stepping into an all-white classroom in 1961 was a brave act. By taking that step, Marian Costner Selby lifted the color barrier in Falls Church’s public schools – three years before the surrounding Fairfax County would desegregate its schools in full ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=%281961,City%20until%20the%20early%201960s)). She went on to finish her studies and in 1964 became the first African American to earn a diploma from George Mason High School ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=served%20as%20minister%20at%20the,Mason%20High%20School%20in%201964)).

In 1963, Marian Costner and fellow Black students led protests here against segregated seating.* Marian’s integration experience was not confined to the schoolhouse. While still in high school, she also took part in local civil rights protests spurred by the national movement. In 1963, during her junior year, Marian and a small group of Black youths organized a picket of the **State Theatre** in downtown Falls Church – which, like many Southern movie theaters, restricted Black patrons to the balcony (if they admitted them at all) ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=With%20the%20urging%20of%20her,agreed%20to%20allow%20them%20in)). Encouraged by Rev. Costner, the students refused to accept this token concession. They marched with signs in front of the theater and stood their ground despite hostility from some onlookers ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=With%20the%20urging%20of%20her,But%20they)). On the picket line, Marian had trash and food thrown at her and even faced a group of self-proclaimed white supremacists who arrived to intimidate the demonstrators ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=With%20the%20urging%20of%20her,agreed%20to%20allow%20them%20in)). Nevertheless, the protest continued until the State Theatre’s management finally agreed to fully integrate seating. This success meant Falls Church’s movie house opened to **all** customers – another incremental victory for equality in the city.

### Challenges and Community Reaction

Marian Costner Selby’s trailblazing role came at a personal cost. As the lone Black student, she often endured open hostility and intimidation from those opposed to integration. Several **documented incidents** illustrate the harassment she faced during 1961–1964:

- **Hostile treatment at school:** White classmates would yell racial slurs in the halls and tell Marian to “go back where she belonged,” while certain teachers also treated her differently (albeit more subtly) ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Costner%20talked%20about%20walking%20through,less%20obvious%20in%20their%20behavior)). Every day, she navigated an environment filled with deliberate isolation and prejudice.  
- **Intimidation at home:** On at least one occasion, vandals **burned a cross** on the Costners’ front lawn – a frightening message aimed at deterring Marian from attending the white school ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=from%20the%20worst)). Another day, she found a **voodoo doll** stuck into the front door of her house; her father quietly disposed of the sinister doll before explaining to Marian (years later) what it symbolized ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=She%20remembers%20waking%20up%20one,to%20her%20attending%20George%20Mason)).  
- **Prom night incident:** In 1963, Falls Church High’s junior-senior prom had to be hastily relocated at the last minute because the original venue – the private Army-Navy Country Club – learned a Black student would be attending. The club warned that if Marian showed up, she would be turned away at the door ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=spent%20days%20picking%20out%20dressed,and%20prom%20dates)). Fearing a legal challenge from Rev. Costner, school officials moved the event to the school cafeteria with far humbler trappings (punch and peanuts instead of a country club ballroom) ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=A%20day%20before%20the%20prom,she%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20allowed%20in)). Many white students were angered by the change. Marian recalled standing in a corner at the make-shift prom, acutely aware of the baleful stares directed at her ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Fearing%20legal%20action%20from%20Rev,her%2C%20it%20was%20so%20intense)). She left after half an hour, sensing that her mere presence had spoiled the evening for some of her peers ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=seniors%20snacked%20on%20peanuts%20and,her%2C%20it%20was%20so%20intense)).  
- **Violent backlash to protests:** During the **State Theatre** pickets in 1963, Marian and her fellow protesters were accosted by members of the community. Some hecklers hurled **rotten fruit and food** at the demonstrators, and a group of avowed segregationists showed up, attempting to menace the Black students into dispersing ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=With%20the%20urging%20of%20her,agreed%20to%20allow%20them%20in)). Such intimidation tactics, however, failed – the protest continued until the theater conceded to integrate. (Notably, no arrests or physical injuries were reported; the students’ resolve and nonviolent approach won out in the end.)

Despite these trials, Marian Costner Selby persevered and graduated in 1964, a testament to courage and “courageous perseverance” in the face of community resistance ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Right%20in%20the%20City%20of,and%20forget%20about%20equal%20rights)). In reflecting on that time, she later admitted it took a psychological toll – “I think I missed an awful lot by attending George Mason,” she said – but she understood the larger importance of what she had done ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Now%2C%20looking%20back%20on%20that,have%20made%20the%20same%20decision)). Her willingness to break the color line under such pressure opened doors for Black students who would follow in Falls Church.

## Lasting Significance and Legacy

Through the determination of Rev. Costner, Marian, and their allies, Falls Church made early strides toward racial integration at a time when much of Virginia remained resistant. The Mary Riley Styles Public Library today acknowledges a “profound debt” to Rev. Costner and E.B. Henderson for ensuring the library would serve *all* citizens back in the 1950s ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=The%20Mary%20Riley%20Styles%20Public,access%20had%20previously%20been%20limited)). Their intervention in 1955 meant Falls Church’s library quietly desegregated its services years before many libraries in the South did ([Library Desegregation | Mary Riley Styles Public Library](https://www.mrspl.org/library-desegregation#:~:text=equal%20access%20to%20public%20libraries,%E2%80%9D2)). Likewise, the successful integration of Falls Church’s schools in 1961–62 – led on the ground by young Marian Costner Selby – put the city ahead of surrounding jurisdictions (Fairfax County, for example, did not fully integrate its public schools until 1965–66) ([Falls Church’s Black History: A Welcoming Community That Has Not Always Been So Welcoming | Falls Church Pulse](https://fallschurchpulse.org/falls-churchs-black-history-henderson/#:~:text=%281961,City%20until%20the%20early%201960s)). This progress was no accident; it was the result of sustained advocacy and personal bravery. 

Rev. Thomas J. “W.E.” Costner’s legacy endures in Falls Church’s history as a pastor who used his voice to champion civil rights and as a community leader who helped dismantle local segregation. His name lives on in the city’s landscape (Costner Drive, near Second Baptist Church, commemorates his family ([M.E. Costner Leads First Class of Black Students Following Approval By Falls Church School Board - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2005/10/06/me-costner-leads-first-class-of-black-students-following-approval-by-falls-church-school-board/#:~:text=Costner%20is%20the%20daughter%20of,remained%20at%20the%20church%20for))) and in the stories passed down about his tireless service. Marian Costner Selby’s legacy, too, has gained recognition as Falls Church has come to honor those who broke barriers. Her experiences as the first Black student are now part of the city’s public historical narrative, illustrating the personal courage behind school desegregation. Together, the contributions of the Costner family significantly advanced racial equality in Falls Church. Their fight for integrated libraries, schools, and public spaces not only improved life for Black residents of their city, but also reflected and reinforced the broader Civil Rights Movement’s goals of justice and inclusion. Through their actions, Rev. Costner and Marian Selby helped Falls Church evolve from a segregated community into a more inclusive one, paving the way for future generations to enjoy the rights and opportunities that they had so steadfastly pursued.
