## Notes

This 1766 advertisement documents a pivotal moment in Falls Church history - the planned construction of the brick Falls Church building that stands to this day. The wooden structure built in 1733 was to be replaced by a more substantial brick church. This advertisement reveals several important historical details:

1. The church was already known as "Falls Church" by 1766
2. The construction was to be awarded through a competitive bidding process
3. The identical brick church in Alexandria was likely Christ Church 
4. William Adams and John Dalton served as churchwardens
5. The building specifications called for 2,400 square feet with galleries
6. The vestry had significant funding (£200) to advance for construction

This document is particularly significant as it relates to the brick church that was completed in 1769, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. George Washington is believed to have served as a vestryman of Truro Parish during this time period, and may have been involved in the planning and oversight of this construction project. After completion, this building would become an important landmark during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.
