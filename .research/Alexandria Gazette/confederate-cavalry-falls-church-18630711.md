# Confederate Cavalry Raid at Fall's Church

## Transcription

"A party of Confederate cavalry entered Fall's church, Va., on the 10th inst., and carried off a number of horses in that village."

## Historical Context

This brief July 1863 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on a Confederate cavalry raid at Fall's Church during the Civil War. The report is terse but significant, noting that Confederate horsemen entered the village on July 10, 1863, and seized an unspecified number of horses.

This raid occurred during a significant moment in the Civil War - just days after the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) and the fall of Vicksburg (July 4, 1863). While major Union victories were being achieved on those fronts, this small report reminds readers that Confederate forces remained active in Northern Virginia, even in areas close to Washington DC.

The raid demonstrates that despite Union control of the region, Fall's Church remained vulnerable to swift Confederate cavalry actions. Such raids were common tactics employed by Confederate cavalry units throughout the war, aimed at acquiring necessary supplies (particularly horses), disrupting Union logistics, and maintaining a Confederate presence in areas nominally under Union control.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This July 1863 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in several other Civil War era documents:

1. **Naming Convention Fluctuation**: The use of "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe in this July 1863 article is particularly significant when compared to the August 1862 reference to "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) in the same newspaper. This inconsistency suggests that naming conventions were still in flux during this period of the Civil War.

2. **Possessive Form Persistence**: Despite the earlier appearance of "Falls Church" in August 1862, this report shows that the possessive form "Fall's Church" continued to be used in print nearly a year later, demonstrating that the transition in spelling was gradual rather than abrupt.

3. **Virginia Designation**: The specific notation of "Fall's church, Va." emphasizes its status as a recognized Virginia location during the Civil War.

4. **Official Usage**: As a report of military activity published in a major regional newspaper, this reference reflects what was likely standard usage in both military reports and general discourse at the time.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 1863 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Spelling Evolution Documentation**: The fluctuation between "Falls Church" (August 1862) and "Fall's Church" (July 1863) in the same newspaper demonstrates that the name's spelling evolved gradually over time, rather than being fixed from the beginning.

2. **Civil War Timeline Extension**: This document extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" into mid-1863, showing the possessive form persisted well into the Civil War period.

3. **Historical Complexity**: The back-and-forth between spelling conventions during the 1862-1863 period suggests that the area's name was in a state of transition during the Civil War, supporting the argument that place names naturally evolve over time.

4. **Virginia Identity**: The explicit designation "Va." reinforces the location's Virginia identity, which remains an important aspect of the community's character that would be preserved in the proposed "Little Falls, VA" name.

This 1863 newspaper reference adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall) even as naming conventions were evolving during the Civil War period.
