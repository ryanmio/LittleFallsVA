# Confederate Forces Near Little Falls and Hospitals at Falls Church

## Transcription of Relevant Portions

"WAR NEWS. A Washington paper of last evening states that heavy firing was heard from the vicinity of Fairfax Station yesterday morning, which probably proceeded from a renewal of the previous engagement. The same paper states that the Confederates have disappeared from the line of the Orange and Manassas railroad, but yesterday morning occupied a hill at Lewinsburg, twelve miles from Washington, and four miles from Little Falls bridge."

[...]

"The hospitals at Falls Church have been discontinued, and the sick and wounded, numbering 1,600, removed to an encampment near by which has been designated as 'Camp Hammond.'"

## Historical Context

This August 30, 1862 war report from the Alexandria Gazette provides rare documentation of both "Little Falls bridge" and "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) appearing in the same newspaper issue during the Civil War. The report offers insights into both the military situation and medical operations in Northern Virginia:

1. Confederate forces were reported to be occupying a position at "Lewinsburg" (likely Lewinsville), specifically noted as being "four miles from Little Falls bridge"
2. Military hospitals at "Falls Church" had been discontinued, with 1,600 sick and wounded soldiers relocated to "Camp Hammond" nearby

This newspaper was published during a pivotal moment in the Civil War. The Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28-30, 1862) was concluding as this edition went to press, and Union forces were in retreat toward Washington. The proximity of Confederate forces to Little Falls bridge (just 12 miles from Washington) would have been alarming news to readers, highlighting the threat to the capital.

The relocation of hospitals from Falls Church suggests the area was no longer considered secure enough for medical operations, likely due to Confederate movements in the region following their victory at Second Bull Run.

## Significance of Naming Conventions

This August 1862 newspaper presents a fascinating linguistic transition point in how the area was referenced:

1. **Geographical Reference**: "Little Falls bridge" is used when referring to the geographical feature and infrastructure

2. **Settlement Name**: "Falls Church" (without the apostrophe) is used when referring to the community/settlement where hospitals had been established

3. **Transition in Progress**: This appears to be one of the earliest documented instances where "Falls Church" appears without the apostrophe, contrasting with the "Fall's Church" spelling consistently used in earlier documents (1802, 1839, 1860) and even in the September 8, 1862 issue of the same newspaper

4. **Simultaneous Usage**: The appearance of both "Little Falls" and "Falls Church" in the same article demonstrates that both geographical references were in concurrent use during this period

This document may represent a pivotal moment in the evolution of the area's name, showing the gradual transition from the possessive "Fall's Church" to the modern "Falls Church" form, while simultaneously demonstrating the continued recognition of "Little Falls" as the primary geographical feature.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 1862 newspaper provides uniquely valuable evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Dual Usage**: The appearance of both "Little Falls" and "Falls Church" in the same newspaper issue demonstrates the historical connection between these two names.

2. **Geographical and Community Distinction**: The usage pattern suggests "Little Falls" referred specifically to the geographical feature and its infrastructure, while "Falls Church" referred to the community that had developed nearby.

3. **Naming Transition Documentation**: The shift from the earlier "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) to "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) seen in this document helps establish when this linguistic change occurred, supporting the argument that the name evolved over time.

4. **Civil War Context**: The strategic importance of both Little Falls bridge and Falls Church during this critical period of the Civil War adds historical weight to both locations and their names.

This August 1862 newspaper provides crucial evidence of how the area's naming evolved, showing that "Little Falls" remained the recognized name for the geographical feature even as "Falls Church" was beginning to be established as the name for the community - demonstrating that the proposed renaming would actually reconnect the community with its original geographical identity.
