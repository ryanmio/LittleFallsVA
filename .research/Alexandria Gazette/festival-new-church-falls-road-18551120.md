## Historical Context

This November 20, 1855 notice in the Alexandria Gazette announces a fundraising festival for a "new Church erected on the Fall's Road." This reference comes from an interesting transitional period in the area's development, just a few years before the Civil War and during a time when the community that would become Falls Church was still being defined geographically rather than as a distinct settlement.

The notice provides several important geographical markers that help locate this church:
1. It was on "Fall's Road" in Alexandria County (now Arlington County)
2. It was three miles from Georgetown
3. It was about 1½ miles west of Ball's Cross Roads (now the Ballston area of Arlington)

This places the church in what was likely the general vicinity of what would later be called Falls Church, though the exact identification with the historic Falls Church building would require additional research.

## Significance of "Fall's Road" Reference

This November 1855 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Road vs. Church Naming**: It refers to "Fall's Road" rather than "Fall's Church," suggesting that at this time, the road leading to the falls was a more prominent geographical identifier than the church itself

2. **Possessive Form**: The road is called "Fall's Road," using the possessive form consistent with early references to "Fall's Church," indicating the road was named for its destination (the falls)

3. **New Church Construction**: The notice mentions a "new Church erected," which could suggest either that this was a newly constructed church building at an established site, or potentially a completely new church location

4. **Geographical Reference Point**: The church is described primarily by its geographic location relative to other known landmarks (Georgetown and Ball's Cross Roads) rather than as a community identifier itself

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This November 1855 reference provides valuable context for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Road Named for Falls**: The existence of "Fall's Road" confirms that roads in the area were named for their destination (the falls), reinforcing the geographical primacy of the falls in local naming conventions

2. **Pre-Community Naming**: This reference suggests that before "Fall's Church" became established as a community name, the area was identified by its relationship to the geographical feature (the falls) via the road name

3. **Geographical Logic**: The naming pattern follows natural geographical logic - the falls were the primary landmark, the road was named for its destination at the falls, and eventually the church along that road became a landmark itself

4. **Evolutionary Process**: This represents an earlier stage in the naming evolution, showing how place names developed organically from geographical features (falls → Fall's Road → Fall's Church → Falls Church)

When added to our existing timeline, this November 1855 reference helps fill an important gap between the early colonial references to "Little Falls" and the Civil War era fluctuation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church." It shows that before the community took on the church's name, the area was identified by roads named for their destinations at the falls, providing another link in the chain connecting the current name back to its geographical origins.

This evidence strengthens the argument that the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative would reconnect the community with its earliest geographical naming logic, restoring the primacy of the natural feature that gave rise to all subsequent naming in the area.
