# Captures in the Neighborhood of Falls Church

## Transcription

"A party consisting of Archibald Sherwood, William Shreeve, Amzi Coe, Benjamin Mosier, Henry Sewell, and Truman Brush were sent to Washington yesterday by the Provost Marshal General of the defences south of the Potomac, having been captured in the neighborhood of Falls Church, Virginia."

## Historical Context

This brief July 15, 1863 notice in the Alexandria Gazette reports on six individuals captured "in the neighborhood of Falls Church, Virginia" and sent to Washington by the Provost Marshal General. Though the notice doesn't specify why these men were captured, during this period of the Civil War, individuals found within Union lines might be detained on suspicion of being Confederate sympathizers, spies, smugglers, or guerrilla fighters.

This report was published just five days after the Confederate cavalry raid on "Fall's Church" reported in the July 11 issue of the same newspaper. The proximity of these events suggests these individuals may have been suspected of collaboration with or connection to Confederate forces in the area.

The report demonstrates the ongoing military activity and security concerns in the Falls Church area during mid-1863, a period when:

1. The Union had just achieved major victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg
2. Confederate forces were still conducting operations within Northern Virginia
3. Civilian movements were closely monitored by Union military authorities

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling

This July 15, 1863 newspaper reference is particularly noteworthy for its spelling of "Falls Church" without the apostrophe, especially when compared to the July 11, 1863 issue of the same newspaper that used "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe):

1. **Rapid Spelling Fluctuation**: The appearance of "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) just four days after "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) in the same newspaper demonstrates remarkable inconsistency in naming conventions, even within a single publication.

2. **Contemporaneous Variation**: This is not a case of naming conventions changing over long periods - this is the same newspaper using different spellings within the same week, suggesting both forms were considered acceptable during this period.

3. **Editorial Inconsistency**: The variation likely reflects a lack of standardized editorial policy regarding the name, with different writers or editors using different forms.

4. **Formal Usage**: Both references appear in similar contexts - brief reports of military/security incidents - yet use different spellings, indicating that even in formal reporting there was no consistent standard.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This July 15, 1863 reference provides particularly compelling evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Documented Spelling Fluctuation**: The rapid shift between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" in the same newspaper within a single week provides the clearest evidence yet that the name's spelling was not fixed but fluid during the Civil War period.

2. **Naming Evolution in Real-Time**: This document, along with the July 11, 1863 reference, captures the name's evolution in real-time, showing that both forms coexisted simultaneously rather than one cleanly replacing the other.

3. **Absence of Historical Fixity**: The lack of consistency in such a short timeframe undermines any argument that the current name has remained unchanged throughout history - clearly, the name has undergone evolutionary changes.

4. **Support for Name Flexibility**: The documented fluidity of the name supports the proposition that place names naturally evolve to reflect changing contexts and cultural understandings - precisely what the Little Falls renaming initiative proposes to do.

This July 1863 newspaper reference, when viewed alongside other contemporary documents, reveals that the name of Falls Church has never been static but has evolved over time, with spelling variations appearing even within the same week in the same publication. This supports the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names can and do change to better reflect their historical and geographical context.
