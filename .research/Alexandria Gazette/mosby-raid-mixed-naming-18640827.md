# Mosby's Raid on Cavalry Camp at Fall's Church/Falls Church

## Transcription

"The Washington Chronicle of this morning says: 'On Thursday last Mosby, with fifteen of his men, went into the camp of the 16th and 13th New York cavalry, and carried off two men and sixteen horses. The camp is at Fall's Church, ten miles from Washington. Mr. Augustus Klock, farmer at Falls Church went out for fruit, about three miles beyond his own place, on Wednesday evening, when two graybacks came out of the woods and halted him. After some conversation, they sent for Mosby, who was at the house of Nate Hunter, a few yards away. Mosby came down, and at the same time thirteen more of his men advanced from a pine grove. He inquired of Mr. Klock if he was a Union man and being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry to have met him; he could not let him return to Fall's Church that night as his own men would have a job on hand there that required secrecy. He requested him to stay at the house of Dr. Hunter, and return home in the morning. At sunrise, next day, Mr. Klock met Mosby and fifteen men going out with their booty. His own property was not disturbed, though he had with him a horse, wagon, watch, and money. Colonel Mosby is about 35 years of age. He is slim, of light complexion, and quick in his motions. He was formerly a private in Stuart's cavalry. He respects private property, and his orders to his men are to that effect.'"

## Historical Context

This August 27, 1864 article in the Alexandria Gazette reports on another exploit of Confederate partisan ranger Colonel John Singleton Mosby and his men. The article recounts two related incidents:

1. Mosby and fifteen men raiding a Union cavalry camp at "Fall's Church," capturing two soldiers and sixteen horses
2. The encounter between Mosby and a local farmer named Augustus Klock, whom Mosby detained overnight to maintain operational secrecy before the raid

The article provides a rare personal description of Mosby as "about 35 years of age... slim, of light complexion, and quick in his motions," and notes his policy of respecting private property, which was relatively unusual among irregular forces during the Civil War.

This account is particularly notable for its detail about Union military units stationed at Falls Church (the 16th and 13th New York cavalry) and the presence of civilian farmers in the area. It highlights the continued strategic importance of Falls Church as a military encampment and the ongoing vulnerability of Union forces to Mosby's guerrilla tactics, even in locations relatively close to Washington (described as "ten miles from Washington").

## Significance of "Falls Church" Spelling Variation

This August 27, 1864 newspaper reference provides the most compelling evidence yet of inconsistent naming conventions, with both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" spellings multiple times in the same article, further demonstrating the inconsistent naming conventions

1. **Multiple Mixed Usages**: The article uses "Fall's Church" (with apostrophe) twice and "Falls Church" (without apostrophe) once, all within the same short account, including:
   - "The camp is at Fall's Church, ten miles from Washington."
   - "Mr. Augustus Klock, farmer at Falls Church went out for fruit..."
   - "...he could not let him return to Fall's Church that night..."

2. **Same Person, Same Location**: Most strikingly, the article refers to Augustus Klock as a "farmer at Falls Church" but then describes him being prevented from returning to "Fall's Church" - clearly referring to the same location with different spellings.

3. **No Discernible Pattern**: There is no consistent pattern to distinguish between references to the military camp versus the civilian settlement - both "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" are used interchangeably for the same community.

4. **Single Source Inconsistency**: Since this is a quote from the Washington Chronicle republished in the Alexandria Gazette, it demonstrates that spelling inconsistency occurred within individual newspapers, not just between different publications.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This August 1864 reference provides perhaps the strongest evidence yet for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative by demonstrating:

1. **Extreme Naming Fluidity**: The repeated alternation between "Fall's Church" and "Falls Church" within a single short account demonstrates remarkable inconsistency in naming conventions, even when referring to the exact same location.

2. **Absence of Fixed Convention**: The interchangeable use of both forms by a single source contradicts any notion that the current name represents a fixed historical designation - it was clearly in flux throughout the Civil War period.

3. **Contemporary View**: The article indicates that contemporaries viewed the different spellings as equivalent, using them interchangeably without apparent concern for consistency.

4. **Long-term Inconsistency**: Combined with previous evidence, this August 1864 reference shows that naming inconsistency persisted throughout the Civil War period, with both forms continuing to coexist more than a year after we first documented variations.

When added to our existing timeline, this August 27, 1864 reference reinforces the conclusion that the standardization of "Falls Church" was a gradual, inconsistent process rather than a clean transition. Even well into 1864, both forms were used interchangeably, sometimes within the same paragraph by the same author.

This documented fluidity in naming conventions provides undeniable historical precedent for the fundamental premise of the renaming initiative: that place names naturally evolve over time to reflect changing historical and cultural contexts. The evidence establishes beyond question that the current name emerged through an inconsistent evolutionary process rather than representing an unchanging historical designation.
