# Lincoln Votes at Fall's Church Precinct

## Transcription

"THE TENTH LEGION.â€”The Tenth Legion of Democracy, it will be seen by the following, gave a majority for Bell over Breckinridge of nearly 2,500, and over Douglas of nearly 3,000. And even adding the vote of Douglas and Breckinridge together, Bell is in a minority of only 1300 in the famed Tenth Legion. The following is the vote:
[Vote tallies for various counties in the Tenth Legion]

SEVENTH DISTRICT.
[Vote tallies for various counties in the Seventh District]

Lincoln received 2 votes in Alexandria city, and 12 at the county precinct, 24 votes in Fairfax, (19 of them at Fall's Church;) 55 in Prince William, (all at Occoquan;) and 1 in Fauquier, a total of 94."

## Historical Context

This November 1860 election report from the Alexandria Gazette provides a fascinating glimpse into voting patterns just before the Civil War. The report details votes in Virginia's "Tenth Legion" and "Seventh District," showing strong support for Constitutional Union candidate John Bell over Southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge and Northern Democratic candidate Stephen A. Douglas.

Most significantly for Falls Church history, the article specifically notes that Abraham Lincoln received 24 votes in Fairfax County, with "19 of them at Fall's Church." This reveals:

1. Falls Church was established as an official voting precinct by 1860
2. The area had unusual political leanings compared to surrounding regions
3. A small but significant pocket of Republican support existed in Falls Church

The 1860 presidential election was one of the most consequential in American history, directly preceding the Civil War. Lincoln won the presidency despite not even appearing on the ballot in most Southern states. Virginia as a whole voted strongly against Lincoln, making these 19 votes at Fall's Church statistically insignificant to the election outcome but historically significant as evidence of Union sentiment in an otherwise Confederate-leaning state.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This 1860 newspaper reference continues the pattern of the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" found in earlier documents:

1. **Ongoing Apostrophe Usage**: The spelling "Fall's Church" with the apostrophe persists in this 1860 reference, showing consistency with the 1802 "Fall's Church road" reference and the 1839 vestry notice.

2. **Election Document Formality**: As an official election report, this document likely reflects formal naming conventions used in government records, suggesting "Fall's Church" remained the official designation.

3. **Pre-Civil War Context**: This November 1860 reference comes just months before the start of the Civil War, providing evidence that the apostrophe usage continued through the antebellum period.

4. **Print Standardization**: The consistent use of the apostrophe across multiple decades and publications (Alexandria Advertiser in 1802, Alexandria Gazette in 1839 and 1860) suggests this wasn't merely a typographical variance but a standardized spelling.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1860 reference provides additional supporting evidence for the "Little Falls, VA" renaming initiative:

1. **Continued Apostrophe Usage**: The persistence of "Fall's Church" (with the apostrophe) in 1860 reinforces the argument that the area was historically understood to be named for its relationship to the geographical feature - it was the church "of the Fall" or "at the Fall."

2. **Timeline Extension**: This document extends the documented timeline of apostrophe usage in "Fall's Church" to at least 1860, spanning nearly six decades (1802-1860) and showing remarkable consistency across multiple sources.

3. **Political Geography**: The identification of Fall's Church as a distinct voting precinct demonstrates its established identity as a recognized place within Fairfax County by 1860.

4. **Historical Complexity**: The unusual voting pattern at Fall's Church (19 votes for Lincoln) suggests a community that may have had distinct cultural or demographic characteristics compared to surrounding areas, potentially supporting the argument for recognizing its unique identity through renaming.

This 1860 election report adds another valuable data point to our understanding of how the name "Fall's Church" was used historically, demonstrating continued use of the possessive form that directly connected the church to the geographical feature (the Fall).
