# Fall's Church Theft Reward Notice

## Transcription

TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.
THE Vestry of Fall's Church will give the above reward for the apprehension and conviction of the person or persons, who, on the night of the 19th instant, broke into the Church and feloniously abstracted a portion of the pulpit decorations, consisting of several yards of Crimson Silk Velvet. By order,
JOHN O. LINDSEY,
Senior Warden.
Fairfax County, June 26--3t

## Historical Context

This 1839 reward notice provides evidence of several aspects of the history of Fall's Church:

1. The formal organization of the church with a vestry and senior warden (John O. Lindsey) overseeing its affairs

2. The church's interior decoration, which included "Crimson Silk Velvet" pulpit decorations valuable enough to warrant a significant reward of twenty dollars when stolen

3. The church's location within Fairfax County

4. The fact that the church building was secure enough that breaking in was necessary to commit the theft

The notice appeared in the Alexandria Gazette, suggesting the church had connections to Alexandria and that its affairs were considered newsworthy to readers in that city.

## Significance of "Fall's Church" Spelling

This notice from 1839 continues the spelling convention of "Fall's Church" with an apostrophe, consistent with the earlier 1802 mention of "Fall's Church road." This spelling appears in an official communication from the church's own vestry, indicating this was the formal name used by the church leadership itself at this time.

The significance of this consistent apostrophe usage includes:

1. **Institutional Self-Identification**: The church vestry—the official governing body—refers to itself as "Fall's Church" with an apostrophe, providing strong evidence this was the accepted institutional name.

2. **Persistence Over Time**: The consistent apostrophe between 1802 and 1839 (a span of 37 years) demonstrates this wasn't a one-time variation but an established naming convention that persisted across decades.

3. **Formal Documentation**: This appears in an official notice published in a major newspaper, suggesting it was the formal, recognized spelling used in public communications.

4. **Continued Possessive Form**: The apostrophe in "Fall's" continues to indicate a possessive relationship between the geographic feature (the Fall) and the church, reinforcing the understanding that the church was defined by its location relative to this landmark.

This document provides important evidence that the apostrophe in "Fall's Church" was not an anomaly but rather the standard spelling used by the church itself in the early-to-mid 19th century.

## Relevance to the Little Falls VA Renaming Initiative

This 1839 vestry notice provides additional compelling evidence supporting the Little Falls VA renaming initiative:

1. **Institutional Acknowledgment**: The vestry's own use of "Fall's Church" (with the apostrophe) shows that even the church's leadership historically understood its identity as being defined by its relationship to the geographical feature.

2. **Established Pattern**: Combined with the 1802 document, this establishes a clear pattern of apostrophe usage spanning nearly four decades, strengthening the historical case for the geographical basis of the name.

3. **Official Usage**: This represents formal, official usage by institutional leadership rather than casual reference, giving it particular weight in understanding the historical name.

4. **Timeline Establishment**: This document helps establish a timeline of when the apostrophe was in common use, which is valuable for tracing how and when the name evolved to the current "Falls Church" without an apostrophe.

The vestry's own identification as "Fall's Church" provides powerful evidence that renaming to "Little Falls" would be historically consistent with how the area's identity was originally understood—as a place defined by its geographical features rather than solely by a religious institution. The apostrophe in the original name clearly indicates the church was "of the Fall" or "at the Fall," demonstrating the primacy of the geographical feature in the area's historical identity.
