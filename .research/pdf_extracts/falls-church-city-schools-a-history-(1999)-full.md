LEBRATION OF TH

Lauren Currier, class of 2001, was the winner of the logo contest for the celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the Falls Church City Public Schools. Chosen from over 100 entries from our
youngest students at Mt. Daniel to adult members of our community, the design was the unan-
imous choice of the selection committee. A banner unveiling her original design debuted at the
1997 Memorial Day Parade and it will be displayed at various locations throughout the City
until the anniversary comes to a close in 1999.

Ms. Currier has attended Falls Church City Public Schools since kindergarten. She has received
recognition from the schools for her art work on a number of occasions. It was her design which
was selected as the basis for the TJ Tiger mascot at Thomas Jefferson
Ls CHURG, Elementary School. In addition to her art studies in public school, Ms.
2 Currier has studied at the Art Students League in New York City and at
the Corcoron in Washington, D.C.

=== Page 7 ===

The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of our
school system provides a unique opportunity
to reflect on our history and achievements and
to contemplate our future challenges. Our
legacy has been a small city with an active cit-
izenry dedicated to the mission of excellent
public education. Since its inception in 1949,
the Falls Church City independent school sys-
tem has produced a concrete measure of its
excellence in the form of a continuous stream
of well-educated graduates.

As with most pioneering efforts, the early
struggles were great in creating a new organi-
zation from scratch. There were construction
projects and teacher recruiting campaigns,
scheduling conflicts and curriculum concerns.
Somehow the obstacles were overcome and
the challenges were met. The result is the
mature school system we have today—one
nationally recognized for excellence.

In recent years we have seen a repetition of
some of those early challenges. Buildings have
been renovated and new staff hired. New pro-
grams have been introduced. Xerox machines,
VCRs and computers have replaced purple
ditto masters, filmstrip projectors and type-
writers. But one thing has remained the

THE PA

same—the commitment of the community and
the staff to provide the best possible education
to all of the students in the Falls Church City
Public Schools. This commitment to excel-
lence in public education continues to be the
bright light leading us forward as we enter our
second half-century and ahead to the new mil-
lennium.

So join us as we pause briefly to enjoy the cel-
ebration of our pride in the past and our hopes
for the future. Then together we will proceed
on our mission of teaching and learning in the

very special City of Falls Church.

UCTION

As the Falls Church community celebrates the
50th anniversary of its school system, citizens
can reflect with pride on the progress and
accomplishments that have taken place. The
Falls Church City school system has earned an
outstanding reputation within the Washington
area and has received recognition from the
state of Virginia, the U.S. Department of
Education, and the International Baccalaureate
community for its vision and efforts to provide
quality education for its students. Some of the
programs and events that have garnered atten-

tion for Falls Church City schools include:

Creating an Eighth Grade Class

In 1949 Falls Church added grade eight, prior
to the state's mandate, and the Falls Church
curriculum was used as a model to develop
Virginia's curriculum for the additional grade.

Integration

Falls Church was the first city in the state of
Virginia to voluntarily integrate African-Ameri-
can students in 1961.

Kindergarten

Half day kindergarten was started in 1964,
prior to the availability of state funding, and
then extended to full-day kindergarten in the
1973-74 school year.

Extended Day Care

Eight years prior to legislation authorizing day
care, Falls Church launched this program in
1975.

Grade Pattern Reorganization
An innovative grade pattern reorganization
was implemented in the Falls Church schools

in 1979 that included moving sixth grade to
create a middle school of grades six through
eight. The elementary schools were reorga-
nized into K-1 and grades 2-5.

International Baccalaureate Program (IB)
Falls Church was the first Virginia school sys-
tem to offer the IB program to 11th and 12th
grade students. In 1998 a Washington Post
Magazine cover story reported that George
Mason's IB program is one of the most inclu-
sive and wide ranging in the U.S., earning GM
a number one ranking for its IB program in the
Washington area.

Excellence in Education Awards

George Mason Senior High School received
an Excellence in Education award in 1982-83
from the U.S. Department of Education citing
it as one of the country's 144 exemplary sec-
ondary schools. In 1986, Mt. Daniel and
Thomas Jefferson Elementary Schools were
selected to receive the same award. And in
1998, George Mason Middle School won the
US. Dept. of Education's Blue Ribbon Award

for excellence.

Technology

A comprehensive K-12 technology plan devel-
oped by and for the Falls Church City Public
Schools was cited as exemplary by the Virginia
Department of Education. In May 1998
Superintendent Shaw announced the creation
of the Falls Church City Public Schools/
Virginia Tech Technology Learning Center.

Many people worked very hard to mold the
schools the City has today. As you read this
publication and learn more about the history of



=== Page 9 ===

the Falls Church City Public Schools, it is our
hope that you will recognize that budgets and
buildings are critical tools in building a school
system. More importantly, it is citizens with a
vision and commitment to quality education
and citizens working through numerous part-
nerships, that have in the past and will contin-
ue to earn the Falls Church City Public Schools
the role as a leader in pursuit of excellence in
education.

Public Education
Begins In Falls

Church,
1875-1945

Looking back to 1875, one can trace the roots
and the events that have led to the accom-
plishments of the past 50 years. One of the
most significant documents in the history of
education in Falls Church was the resolution in
1875-76 for residents to subscribe to the build-
ing fund for the Jefferson Institute. The resolu-
tion reads as follows:

ee a

We citizens and residents of Falls Church
and vicinity hereby agree and bind our-

names for the purpose of aiding a public

een

Graded School in the village of Falls i

Church for the school year 1875-76.

This resolution marked the beginning of pub-
lic education in Falls Church. Prior to that
time, the children in Falls Church attended a
private school located near The Falls Church
(Episcopal).

Joseph E. Birch donated the land from his farm
for the building, and in the deed specified that
the land should never be used for anything
other than educational purposes. The proper-
ty, located on what is now North Cherry
Street, is the current site of the Child
Development Center of Northern Virginia.
Construction of the Jefferson Institute began
in 1880, and in 1882 the building was opened
for students under the jurisdiction of Fairfax
County. Author and Falls Church resident Ada

Walker wrote of her memories:

I first saw the Jefferson Institute in 1886 when I
was eleven years old. My seatmate and I spent the
noon hour cleaning the plaster off the window glass
in our room, using chips from the wood pile and
plain water.

The building was completed in 1882 after a peri-
od of some 6 or 7 years of organization and fund
raising, during most of which time classes were con-
ducted in the old Columbia Baptist Church on East
Broad Street. The money was raised by the people of
the Falls Church community, by subscription.
Fairfax County furnished the seats, blackboards,
water buckets, and paid the teachers.

Over the 50 years the Falls Church City school system has been in operation, the quality of education has
steadily improved. Many new and innovative programs have been added to the offerings of the school system.
The following time line includes historical events leading up to the beginning of an independent school system in

1949 and follows some of the major events that have occurred and programs that have been implemented in the

Falls Church schools.

The basement bad two rooms—a school room in
front and a furnace room in the back. The first floor
had two classrooms, and the top floor bad a large
stage across one end, and seats in the rest of the
room. At one time it was used as a classroom.
Mostly it was used for commencement exercises,
and later we outfitted it as a gymnasium.

Three teachers took care of all who came, and
taught from the first to the eighth grade. Each
teacher bad from 40 to 60 pupils...

With our fathers, we children gave the school a
lovely flag, a dictionary, a bible, and a clock for
the Principal's room. (Memories of Old Jefferson
Institute, Falls Church, Virginia, by Ada Walker,
June 10, 1964)

By the turn of the century, the Jefferson Insti-
tute, now called the Jefferson School, was used
as a primary school and students of high
school age attended schools in either Fairfax
County or Washington, D.C., since there was
no high school in Falls Church.

Growth in the Schools

The population of the Falls Church area grew
steadily and in the early 1920s, the School
Board for the town began a search for land suit-

able for a new elementary school. In 1923,
after a thorough investigation of several avail-
able properties, a parcel of land on Lee High-
way and Great Falls Street was identified as the
best location for the new school. This piece of
land, containing 2.7 acres and purchased for
$4,850, was the future site of Madison Elemen-
tary School.

With the purchase of land for a new elemen-
tary school, the School Board decided that the
Jefferson School could now be used to meet
the needs of high school students. In April
1923, the School Board decided the Jefferson
School would be offered to Fairfax County on
the condition that it be used to maintain a
four-year consolidated high school. However,
in August 1923, the Fairfax County School
Board would only agree to pay for one more
teacher, enabling the town of Falls Church to
conduct only two full years of high school.
The enrollment of the school district at that
time was 359 students, 20 of those in high
school.

But there was a problem with this plan. The
town of Falls Church lay partly within the
jurisdiction of both Fairfax and Arlington
counties and was situated so that portions of
the town lay within four magisterial dis-

tricts. A “county unit” law enacted in

~ 1923 abolished local school boards and
vested title to property and control of

funds in the hands of county boards.

The result was chaos and forced the stoppage
of all plans for building a new school in Falls
Church. However, in January 1924, House Bill
352 was introduced in the Virginia General
Assembly to create a special school district for
the town of Falls Church. The bill specified
that a district School Board composed of three
members appointed by the town council
would have jurisdiction over the administra-
tion of Falls Church schools. This Board had
the right to be represented on the School
Board of Fairfax County. The title to the
school property was to remain with the School
Board of the town of Falls Church. The admin-
istration of the schools was to be under that
Board, subject to the approval of the county
School Board on all matters of county-wide
concern. Thus, when this bill became law, the
newly formed district Falls Church School
Board was able to proceed with its proposal for
a bond issue to finance a new school building.

“The building was to be of modern design and
attractive appearance to be constructed of brick and
tile or of native stone if found more economical.
There will be 10 class-rooms besides principal’ room
and library and an assembly room seating 400 or
more.” (By Fence and Fireside, by Melvin Lee
Steadman, Falls Church Public Library,
1964) It was to include “all modern conveniences
including drinking fountains, electric lights, cloak
rooms and special safety equipment in case of fire."
(The Commonwealth, September 25, 1926)

The new elementary school was completed in

1926 at a cost of $86,500. At the School Board
meeting of April 6, 1926, the Board adopted a
resolution naming the school in honor of
James Madison. The school was dedicated on
September 20, 1926.

As James Madison Elementary School was
nearing completion in the fall of 1925, the
Falls Church School Board once again present-
ed the idea for establishing a four-year accred-
ited high school to Fairfax County. The
Jefferson School, they felt, could be used for a
consolidated high school and maintained by
state and county funds. This plan was imple-
mented in 1927, giving Falls Church a well-
established school system for seven years of
elementary school and four years of high
school. It was not until Falls Church had an
independent school system in 1949 that the
eighth grade was added, prior to the state's
mandate. In fact, the curriculum for Falls
Church served as a model to develop the state's
curriculum for the additional grade.

The town of Falls Church maintained its sepa-
rate school system under the jurisdiction of the
Fairfax County School Board until 1942. At
that time, the Virginia State Legislature passed
the McCandlish Act, which abolished the Falls
Church special school district, and stated that
Falls Church schools must be transferred back
to Fairfax County and at no time in the future
could the schools be returned to Falls Church.
In 1945 Fairfax County built Falls Church High
School, later named Whittier School, and

Post World War Il
Brings Growth And
An Independent
School System

New Residents, New Ideas

Following World War II, the population of Falls
Church almost tripled as a result of the rapid
growth of Washington, D.C., and the spill over
into the surrounding areas. This tremendous
increase in population placed a heavy burden
on the town’s services, including its schools.
The administration suggested instituting half-
day sessions and the addition of quonset huts in
back of Madison and Jefferson schools to
relieve overcrowding at the elementary level.
The infrastructure was sorely stressed.

“Outraged parents scrubbed filthy lavatories in
the [Madison] school, banked earth around the
quonset but, scrounged up pieces of floor tile and

tacked them down to keep winter winds from coming
through its floor. The old Jefferson School building
was a fire hazard," remembers city resident

Franklin Thackrey.

The new residents brought different ideas with
them to the city. They demanded higher qual-
ity educational and municipal services than
was customary in rural Virginia and were will-
ing to pay the taxes and float the bonds neces-
sary to finance these improvements. Many
long-time residents, who were accustomed to
low taxes, minimum services, and a pay-as-
you-go fiscal policy, strongly opposed these
notions. With the school system under the
control of the county, many Falls Church resi-
dents were convinced that the town was pay-
ing more in taxes than it was getting back as its

share of school funds.

A desire to gain more control over the City’s
future growth was emerging. But that was not
possible under a town form of government.
There was also growing support to own and
control its own school system. A 1948 special
census conducted by volunteers from the
Parent-Teacher Association found that Falls
Church had more than the 5,000 population

required to become a City of the Second
Class. Despite some opposition, Falls Church
was incorporated in August 1948 as an inde-
pendent city, politically separate from Fairfax
County.

An Independent School System

The desire for an independent school system
finally came to fruition on June 27, 1949, when
the State Board of Education granted Falls
Church the status of a separate school division.
The McCandlish Act was declared unconstitu-
tional, and the Falls Church schools were no
longer part of the Fairfax County school sys-
tem. By becoming an independent school dis-
trict, Falls Church was able to retain, for the
benefit of its own children, the school tax rev-
enues that previously had been spread
throughout the county school system. This
meant that by keeping the same tax rate of
$2.65 per $100 of assessed value that Fairfax
County had charged the city, Falls Church was
able to increase substantially the educational
services provided for its own children.

The next step was to set up a governing board
for the new school system. The first City
School Board was sworn into office by the
Clerk of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County at
8:00 P.M. on Tuesday, July 5, 1949. The nine
members of this first Board were: Mrs. Mark
Regan, Dr. John R. Miles, Dr. Joseph Seay, Mr.

James Lay, Mr. Lyle Webster, Mr. Rex Hinshaw,
Mr. John Johnson, Mrs. John Wallace, and Mr.
George Reeves. Mr. Reeves, who had been the
City’s member on the Fairfax County School
Board, resigned during the first year and was
succeeded by Mr. William Glover. The original
membership of the board was nine, but under
the new City Charter it was dropped to seven.
Helen Regan was elected chairman of the
Board and Dr. Joseph Seay was elected vice-
chairman.

One of the first items the new School Board
had to consider was hiring a superintendent.
The Board's personnel committee recommend-
ed Irvin Schmitt, a former superintendent of
schools in Davenport, lowa. He was appointed
to the position on July 8, 1949, with a salary of
$7,000 per year. The first employee of the new
board was Eleanor Justusson, who was appoint-
ed clerk of the Board. She also served as secre-
tary and generally did everything else that need-
ed to be done. She served the Board in this dual
capacity until she retired in the early 1960s.

In its first year of operation, the Falls Church
school system had a budget of $201,836, two
school buildings, 33 teachers, a superintendent
and one principal. Teachers’ salaries ranged
from $1,900 to $4,200 per year and the per-
pupil cost was $147.98. The average daily
attendance was 763 for city students.

The most urgent problem now facing the
Board was the critical shortage of facilities.
The court settlement dividing the community's
school buildings only conveyed title of the
Madison School and the aging Jefferson
School to the city. The Oak Street Elementary
School (now Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School) and the Falls Church High School
(later named the Whittier School on Hillwood
Avenue) remained under the control of Fairfax
County even though the Falls Church School
Board made every effort to purchase them.
The settlement left the city with no high
school and badly overcrowded and outdated
facilities for elementary students.

Because of space shortages, Falls Church and
Fairfax County resorted to several temporary
arrangements. Without a high school building
of its own, Falls Church had no choice but to
continue to send its high school pupils to Falls
Church High School, owned and administered
by Fairfax County. The County was also facing
an acute shortage of elementary school space in
the Falls Church area. These shortages prompt-
ed the City and County school administrations
to agree, for the time being, to a plan providing
the least possible disruption to the students.
The city continued to allow County children
who had previously attended Madison and
Jefferson schools to remain in those schools,

1952

a A wi 1953

and the county took City students into Oak
Street School and Falls Church High School.

Later, this situation was eased somewhat with
the completion of Falls Church's Mt. Daniel
Elementary School, which opened on January
7, 1952. By the 1952-53 school year, the
exchange with the Fairfax County program was
limited to grades one through three and was
administered so the numbers of City and
County students would be equal, thus cancel-
ing out need for tuition payments. In 1955 the
City purchased Oak Street School and the

exchange program was phased out.

Planning For

New Schools

The School Board conducted a special census
in 1949 to determine the future needs for facil-
ities. This revealed that the number of pre-
school children exceeded the number of
school-age children, indicating increased future
educational needs. In addition, the population
in the area was growing rapidly. Faced with this
situation, the School Board asked the City
Council to call for a referendum to authorize
bonds to finance construction of new buildings.
On November 17, 1949, the voters approved a
$700,000 bond issue. Two school sites were

purchased: the 25-acre Flagg property at
Leesburg Pike and Haycock Road for $40,000,
and the 7.3-acre property owned by Leonard P.
Daniel on North Oak Street for $21,900. These
properties became the sites of George Mason
Junior/Senior High School and Mt. Daniel Ele-
mentary School. Both of these buildings were
planned with possible future expansion in mind
when more money might be available. In the
first stage, the high school was to accommo-
date 325 pupils, and the elementary school was
to contain four classrooms. The bond referen-
dum also provided money for extensive renova-
tions to Madison and Jefferson schools.

In 1950 the School Board proposed a four-year
school construction program to further allevi-
ate overcrowding. This program included the
addition of a multi-purpose room at Madison
School as well as a new roof, rewiring, and the
installation of a gas hot water heater. For the
first time in the school's history, there was hot
water in the lavatories and children no longer
had to wash in icy cold water. The construction
program also called for completion of Mt.
Daniel to contain 12 classrooms, and expansion
of George Mason to accommodate 700 to 800

students and to include an auditorium, library,
cafeteria, and rooms for vocational education.

A shortage of steel delayed construction of
George Mason and Mt. Daniel. In 1951 the
School Board rented temporary space at the
Thompson house at Seven Corners for grades
10 and 11, and used other houses and church
facilities for the elementary students. The.
Jefferson School was used for grades seven,
eight and nine. The School Board passed a res-
olution in 1951 requesting that the Fairfax
County School Board accept all Falls Church
pupils in the 12th grade, and allow them to
attend Falls Church High School on a tuition
basis for the 1951-52 school year.

Building George Mason

With the high school construction nearing
completion, the School Board began soliciting
suggestions for the school name. Proposals
included Old Dominion, Northwestern,
Columbia, Falls Church, Thomas Jefferson,
McArthur, and Haycock. A request was made
to the Fairfax County School Board to change
the name of its Falls Church High School, but

this was denied. Ultimately the name of



=== Page 18 ===

George Mason was selected, and the school
was dedicated on October 10, 1952. At the
time of the dedication, George Mason housed
grades seven through twelve with 432 students
and a professional staff of 22 full-time and five
part-time teachers. The 1953 George Mason
yearbook proclaimed, “The formal dedication sig-
naled a new era in secondary education. The great piles
of steel, bricks, and bags of concrete soon grew into this
magnificent and modern building containing gymnasi-
um, laboratory, library, and classrooms.”

That structure marked the first stage in the
development of a facility to accommodate
between 700 and 800 students within the next
three to four years. The building included a
combination gymnasium-auditorium with
dressing and shower rooms, science laboratory,
home economics laboratory, general industrial
arts shop, library, teachers’ room, clinic, cafe-
teria, kitchen, and administration offices. But
sufficient funds were not available to provide
enough space for current enrollment, and addi-
tional classrooms were urgently needed. Due
to severe overcrowding, most of the special
rooms were used as classrooms and the gym
temporarily served as a dining room with a
large section partitioned into classrooms. New
federal and state appropriations provided
funds for an addition in 1953 to alleviate the
situation until the City could provide more
money. These appropriations, known as
Federal Impact Aid, were given to areas with a
large population of federal government
employees. Future additions were to include a
dining room, additional shops, a visual educa-
tion room in conjunction with the library,
more administration space, several more class-
rooms, and an auditorium.

The school rented adjacent land owned by Dr.
Oscar E. Kiessling as a temporary athletic
field. The School Board paid Dr. Kiessling
$200 a year for the use of the field, adding a
focal point for the new school.

We were never as proud of our school as we were
the day they dedicated our football field. There were
so many reasons to be proud. Our fathers had been
out there with shovels, axes, picks, rakes and their
bare bands and bad cleared the field. Our band,
decked out in their new red and white uniforms, made
every one of us beam as they marched around the
field. (1954 yearbook)

On October 3, 1953, at the first game ever
played on the George Mason athletic field, a
plaque was presented to John C. Yarbrough on
behalf of the Falls Church School Board, the
faculty, and students. This plaque was in
recognition of Mr. Yarbrough’s leadership in
the difficult task of clearing away the forest
that had stood there fifteen months earlier.
This marked the beginning of a sports program
that has played an important role in the life of
George Mason since 1953.

Mt. Daniel Construction

In addition to the construction of George
Mason High School, the City had further
plans to house its growing student population.
Mt. Daniel was the first elementary school to
be constructed after Falls Church became a
separate school district. The building was
designed so it could be built in stages as funds
became available. The first section of Mt.
Daniel consisted of four rooms and was ready
for occupancy in February 1952. Two more

primary rooms were added to Mt. Daniel in
1953. The third section was completed in
April 1956.

The completed building consisted of 12 class-
rooms, a multi-purpose room, library, teachers’
room, and principal's office with conference/
clinic room, several storage rooms, cafeteria,
kitchen, and boiler room. The building housed
grades one through six, accommodating around
300 children. The approximate cost of the fin-
ished plant, including grounds, building, archi-
tects’ fees, and equipment, was $700,000. The
completed Mt. Daniel Elementary School was
dedicated in May 1956. In 1989, Mt. Daniel
underwent a $2 million renovation which added
classroom space and a new media center, updat-
ed the heating and air conditioning systems,
and replaced the windows and doors to make
the building more energy-efficient.

Oak Street Elementary School

When George Mason and Mt. Daniel were
being constructed, Oak Street Elementary
School was still owned by Fairfax County,
even though it was physically in the city limits
of Falls Church. The County opened the
school for use in September 1948, but it was
not completely finished until February 1949.
The school was designed to accommodate 450
students, but because of the increased area stu-

Jefferson Elementary School

Oak Street School transferred to
Falls Church from Fairfax County;

dent population, its enrollment in September
1950 was already 932. To handle so many stu-
dents, half-day sessions were instituted, tem-
porary classrooms were set up in the cafeteria,
and the library space was used as a classroom.
The actual library was relocated in a small
room, and mothers served as librarians. In
1954, Falls Church began negotiations with
Fairfax County to acquire the Oak Street
School. The city agreed to pay $385,000 for
the building, and took ownership on July 19,
1955, upon completion of the new Fairfax
County schools in the immediate vicinity of

Falls Church.

Closing the Jefferson School

With four elementary schools now in the City,
the School Board decided the old Jefferson
School was no longer needed. A local newspa-
per mourned its passing:

Jefferson School, Belfry
And All, Retired At 81

Battered but unbowed, the old Jefferson School in Falls
Church has been retired for school purposes. The two-
story brick building which has pigeons in its belfry is 84
years old (sic).

The belfry is old Jefferson's proudest possession. Modern

schools have their fancy tiled walls, intricate mazes of
corridors, cafeterias, libraries and assorted other doo-

dads.
Belfry Distinguished It

Old Jefferson had none of these. Just six classrooms,
only five of which were school-worthy....

A few old-time residents of the city recall bow the big bell
used to echo through the country streets. It could be heard
two miles away, according to their stories. When the big
bell became too much of a weight for the sagging belfry

to bear it was taken down and put in storage.
Old Jefferson may not be permitted the luxury of a
graceful retirement. City officials are making plans to

restore the building, possibly for use as a museum.

Standing looking up at Old Jefferson's Belfry, listening

to the wind bum through the vents and thinking about the
restoration plans, it's easy to imagine the old building
chuckling complacently to itself:

“Theres life in Old Jeff yet.”
(Washington, D.C.Evening Star, April 18, 1956)

On March 6, 1956, the title to the Jefferson
School was transferred to the Falls Church City
Council, and the school, despite talk of making
it a museum, was torn down in November 1958.

Subsequently, the Falls Church City Council
passed a resolution renaming the Oak Street
School the Thomas Jefferson Elementary School
to commemorate the old Jefferson School. In
the last push to handle the increasing enroll-
ment in the Falls Church City Public Schools,
two classrooms were added to Thomas Jefferson
in 1959. At long last, Falls Church had an inde-
pendent school system with adequate facilities
to house all of its students!

Controversy Over
Funding Marks First
Decade

The establishment of a complete school sys-
tem was not accomplished, however, without
controversy. During the first decade, political
strife in the city was heated and the schools
remained at the center of the storm. Some res-
idents vigorously opposed the approval of the
bond issue for the new high school, the reno-
vation of Madison, and the purchase of land
for George Mason and Mt. Daniel, preferring
to remain a part of the Fairfax County school
system. This faction gained control of the Falls
Church City Council in 1951 and ordered an
investigation of the School Board based on
charges of malfeasance. They felt the facilities
the School Board was using to house the stu-
dents were grossly inadequate, which rein-
forced their desire to remain part of the coun-
ty system. The controversy was fed by the
delays in construction of the new buildings
resulting from postwar steel shortages.

Claiming harassment as a result of the investi-
gation, six of the seven members of the School
Board offered their resignations. The seventh
member was out of the country at the time. But
support for the Board was quickly forthcom-
ing. Several hundred citizens attended the
Council meeting at which the resignations
were considered, demanding that the Council
not accept them. However, the Council did
accept the resignations and a new School
Board was sworn in on October 24, 1951.

In 1953 supporters of the school system
regained control of the Council and appointed

#
ay

new members to the School Board. Throughout
the remainder of the decade, however, there
was a continuing battle as alternating groups
were elected. These political ups and downs had
a substantial effect on the schools, often delay-
ing needed improvements to the facilities.

Controversy arose once again in 1957 when
the Council rejected a School Board request
for a bond issue to expand the high school,
despite a petition signed by 1,200 residents
favoring the expansion. The Council went so
far as to replace the School Board members
who had recommended the bond issue. The
newly constituted School Board voted to elim-
inate 12 positions from the school staff and
proposed to house children in quonset huts
rather than planning for permanent buildings.
Once again public ire was aroused. At one
School Board meeting, more than 300 people
attended to show their concern for the
schools. On two other occasions, bond issues
appropriating money for the schools were
defeated or postponed as a result of court suits
brought by opponents of the system.

School System
Thrives

Despite difficulties, the school system contin-
ued to grow. In 1951 the enrollment in the city
schools was 1,151 students; in 1952, it was
1,357; in 1953 it was 1,528; and in 1955 it was
1,741. The peak enrollment was in 1965-66
when there were approximately 2,200 students
attending Falls Church schools.

Renovations and construction continued at
George Mason to accommodate enrollment
increases. A permanent football field, a track,

and tennis courts were added to George
Mason in the early 1960s. An addition in 1962
included the classrooms that later made up
part of the middle school, a small activity gym,
shower and locker rooms, and enlarged admin-
istration space and library.

In 1964 most classroom needs had been met
and city residents began discussions for a City
auditorium and a community center. The City
Council appointed a citizens’ committee to
study the city and school needs. This commit-
tee recommended the need for two buildings:
a theater-type auditorium at George Mason
and a community center near City Hall. An
auditorium had, in fact, been part of the plan
for a complete junior-senior high school facili-
ty from the first drawings in 1951. Since it also
was obvious that George Mason needed addi-
tional vocational facilities, the proposed solu-
tion was to make the vocational rooms a part
of the auditorium addition. The plan was
approved by the City Council, and in Novem-
ber 1966 a referendum to provide for bonds to
finance the addition passed overwhelmingly.
The auditorium and vocational classrooms
were dedicated on September 13, 1969. A li-

Falls Church Integrates Its Schools

After the United States Supreme Court ruled
against segregation in the public schools in
1954, a program of “massive resistance” took
place in Virginia. The State legislature passed a
law which would deny State aid to any public
school that placed black and white children in
the same classroom. Under the leadership of
Governor Lindsey Almond the legislation was
repealed in January of 1959.

Following the collapse of Virginia's “massive
resistance” program, Falls Church became the

African-American children into the school system

first Virginia city to voluntarily integrate its
African-American children into the school sys-
tem. Prior to that time, tuition was paid by the
school system to send these elementary pupils
to James Lee Elementary School in Fairfax
County and high school students to the
regional high school in Manassas or a high
school in Washington, D.C. The School
Board's decision to integrate its schools in 1961
created for Falls Church a reputation for lead-
ership in education throughout the state.

The 1970s Spawn
Dramatic Changes

The Closing of Madison

By 1973-74 the enrollment was 1,800 students;
dropping to 1,039 in 1983-84 and today it is
approximately 1,500. The decrease in school
enrollment that occurred in the late 1970s can
be attributed to the Tyler Garden apartment
complex (now Winter Hill) converting to con-
dominiums. Another factor was the increase in
the cost of housing in the city, which discour-
aged families with children from moving into

the City.

Faced in the early 1970s with the continued

1964

decline in enrollment, a joint City Council-
School Board resolution was passed in April
1975 establishing a community task force on
school building needs. In July 1976, the task
force recommended that the city operate two,
rather than three, elementary schools, each
with a capacity of 350-to-400 students, and
each to be renovated.

Madison Elementary School was approaching
its 50th birthday and September 20, 1976 was
proclaimed “Madison School Day in the City
of Falls Church.” Madison was rededicated as a
community school, an act which recognized
the role of that school in serving the total pop-
ulation in areas of pre-school and child
resource centers, extended day care, senior cit-
izens’ programs, instruction in English as a
Second Language, and programs in adult edu-
cation. But after 50 years, Madison School was
in need of renovation.

On November 16, 1976, the School Board voted
to renovate Madison during the 1978-79 school
year in accordance with the recommendation of
the Facilities Task Force. The Task Force also
recommended that Thomas Jefferson be reno-
vated during the summer of 1977. Mt. Daniel
would be upgraded to house a slightly larger stu-

dent and staff population for the years of reno-
vation of Madison and Thomas Jefferson. By
1979-80, all students would be housed in the
two renovated schools, both actually in the city,
and Mt. Daniel would possibly be converted to
other uses.

Numerous public hearings were held on the
proposed renovations and the closing of one of
the elementary schools. Neighborhoods sur-
rounding each school fought hard to try to
save their school. Ultimately the School Board
made the difficult decision to close Madison
School in lieu of Mt. Daniel, as had been pre-
viously decided. Mt. Daniel was the newer of
the two schools and could serve the needs of
the city for more years than Madison. In addi-
tion, Thomas Jefferson was to be the only
school to undergo renovation at that time. In
May 1979, the School Board adopted a resolu-
tion to deed the Madison School property to
the City to be used for municipal purposes.
There were many suggestions for the use of the
building. However, it was deemed too costly
to maintain the building in a usable condition
and it was torn down in 1979.

In the fall of 1979, George Mason underwent a

$2 million renovation making it accessible for
disabled students with the addition of two ele-

1969-70

1971

vators, a ramp to the auditorium area, and a
restroom. Energy conservation measures, in-
cluding a new heat and air conditioning sys-
tem, dropped ceilings, lowered window spaces,
and sound insulation were added, along with
new lighting. The middle school area was
changed to accommodate its new role.

Grade Patterns Reorganized: Loss of Neigh-
borhood Schools

The 1978-79 school year saw students from
Thomas Jefferson divided between Madison
School and Mt. Daniel School while the reno-
vation of Thomas Jefferson took place. The
sixth grade students were moved to George
Mason. Thomas Jefferson Elementary School
reopened in September 1979 with 16 classes
and approximately 340 students. Mt. Daniel
had three kindergarten and three first grade
classes with an enrollment of approximately
110 students.

With only two elementary schools remaining
in Falls Church, the School Board decided in
1979 to reorganize the grade patterns of all the
schools. Under the new plan, Mt. Daniel
Elementary School housed kindergarten and
first grade and Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School grades two through five. The sixth grade
remained at George Mason Junior/Senior High

School, and a middle school, a growing entity
in education, was created for grades six through
eight. This pattern of grade organization is still
in place today.

From 1980 to 1985, enrollments at Thomas
Jefferson declined to a low of 13 classes, how-
ever, by 1985 there was an increase to 14 class-
es. Today there are 21 classes with 448 stu-
dents. The enrollment at Mt. Daniel has also
increased over the past five years. Currently
there are five kindergarten and five first grade
classes.

Educational
Innovations

Falls Church has been an innovative educa-
tional community. In 1964, Falls Church began
offering kindergarten—prior to the availability
of state funding. Falls Church again led the
way when kindergarten became a full-day pro-
gram in 1973. And recognizing that many
mothers were working outside the home, Falls
Church started its extended day care program
in 1975, eight years prior to legislation autho-
rizing the same, to offer safe, affordable, qual-
ity child care to elementary students before
and after school.

Arlington Career Center

To more adequately provide for the needs of
students interested in vocational education,
the Falls Church School Board contracted with
neighboring Arlington County in 1981 to sup-
port a limited number of students to attend the
Arlington Career Center. The Career Center is
designed to serve as an extension of the pro-
gram at George Mason. It provides education-
al experiences in the areas of occupational
exploration, career preparation, and enrich-
ment to those students desiring to benefit from
a hands-on learning style. Students are assisted
in job placement upon successful completion
of their program.

George Mason the First High School in
Virginia to Offer the IB Program

On May 5, 1981, the International Baccalaure-
ate Program (IB) was approved by the School
Board. Falls Church was the first Virginia
school system to offer the rigorous program.
The IB is an internationally recognized pro-
gram of studies which is available to highly
motivated 11th and 12th graders at George
Mason. It requires community service, a senior
thesis, and academic courses in all subject
areas. Students take examinations in May
which are evaluated externally. Many colleges
and universities in the United States recognize
the diploma and/or the subject certificates

earned in partial fulfillment of the diploma.
These schools give course credit or advanced
standing to a student who earns a satisfactory
score on the IB exams.

George Mason High School was the site of the
Eleventh Annual International Baccalaureate
Heads of Schools Conference in 1988 with
representatives from 32 nations in attendance.

George Mason has one of the most open IB
programs in the world and it has become more
inclusive over the years with nearly 70 percent
of the juniors and seniors taking at least one IB
course. During the 1996-97 school year, 150
juniors and seniors participated in IB classes
and a remarkable 28 seniors received the pres-
tigious IB diploma in 1997. GM maintains one
of the best records nationwide, and it contin-
ues to expand offerings to meet the needs and
interests of a growing number of students in all
fields. In recent years the school has added IB
courses in theater arts, music and art/design,
and a science sequence that all help to main-

tain a balance consistent with the academic
rigor and quality of the program.

Jay Matthews, a nationally recognized educa-
tion reporter for The Washington Post, gave
George Mason the top ranking in the
Washington area for encouraging students to
take IB courses. Schools with a rating of 1,000
or higher are considered to be in the top 2 per-
cent in the country. George Mason scored
3,146. In a March 22, 1998 Washington Post
Magazine cover story Matthews wrote: “...more
high-level courses are offered to a larger slice of the stu-
dent body than at any other public school in the
Washington area.” "...in some ways it outshines every
other school I have ever visited.”

Special Education

Falls Church City Public Schools has had a
program for special education students since
the beginning of the school division in 1949.
In the early days special education identifica-
tion was not used as it is today. The teachers
taught “slow learners” or “special, ungraded

children.” At the elementary level there was a
younger ungraded class and an older one.
There was also a class at the secondary level.
The children who were placed with these
teachers had a multiple range of disabilities,
both physical and mental, as well as being
emotionally disturbed. The classes were kept
to about ten students, but there were no aides
to assist the teacher.

In the late 1960s a pilot program had the least
severely disabled children attend regular class-
es. The class sizes were quite large and there
was no support staff to assist the classroom
teacher. A regional Crisis Resource Center
model, originated at George Washington
University (GWU), introduced a new concept
to working with special children. The crisis
resource teacher would take the children out
of the classroom when they were not in con-
trol and attempt to allay their anxiety or dis-
ruptive behavior. Along with the in-school
program, there was a Crisis Resource Center
located on East Columbia Street manned by
GWU staff which attempted to teach tech-
niques to parents and teachers. The program
was not successful and was terminated in 1972.

George Mason,

Ma

There were no programs for the mentally re-
tarded children. There was a policy that stated
that “these children would not benefit from
education,” and therefore the students did not
“fit in." The school system supported the place-
ment of mentally retarded children into private
schools and the parents were tasked with find-
ing the placement. Families could ask for a
reimbursement of $1,500 from the school sys-
tem, but this amount usually did not totally
cover the tuition. To assist these parents many
co-operative, non-profit schools came into exis-
tence. If a child was designated “trainable,” the
school system did not offer reimbursement.
The State operated training centers, such as the
Northern Virginia Training Center, for the
trainable children. Other centers enrolled chil-
dren who had specific disabilities such as deaf-
ness or blindness.

In 1971, a family who had a trainable child

requested reimbursement from the school sys-
tem to send the student to a private placement.
Since it was not under the policy, the request
was denied. Superintendent Pace was concerned
about the fairness of the policy and lobbied
the School Board to amend it. So in 1972 the

program for educating learning disabled stu-
dents in pull-out classes in the schools began
to evolve. Tuition assistance for the more
severely disabled students continued, but the
payment was made directly to the private or
public school for full tuition, and the place-
ment was obtained by the school psychologist.

The Virginia General Assembly legislated a
bold action in 1974 by requiring all school sys-
tems to provide services for all special educa-
tion students. This action was a year ahead of
the federal law 94-142 which mandated special
education with annual individual educational

plans (IEPs) for all disabled children

A further development took place in 1975
which provided state funding for the hiring of
child development specialists who would iden-
tify special education pre-school children. The
specialist would conduct home instruction for
the parents and the children.

Beginning in 1989, a feasibility study was con-
ducted to determine the appropriateness of
providing services within the school system for
all special education students, eliminating the
majority of outplacements. Ten mentally
retarded students were identified as children
who could have a successful experience by
being in the regular school program. A stake-

holders committee of parents, administrators,
and regular and special education teachers was
formed to prepare for the transition. Additional
special education staff, both teachers and para-
professionals, was hired to implement the pro-
gram, and students with severe needs began
attending the schools in Falls Church in 1992-
93. Although there were many challenges to be
addressed, it was immediately apparent that the
students could be integrated into the main-
stream of the regular education classes with
benefits for all concerned.

In the years that ensued, the program which
was initially called the Inclusion Program has
become all inclusive as most special education
students spend 90 percent of the instructional
day in regular education classrooms. The stu-
dents are now an integral part of their schools
participating in extra-curricular clubs and activ-
ities. The Circle of Friends Club was estab-

lished to promote friendships with their peer
groups, and the results have been a widening of
awareness for all students.

Technology

A high priority for the school system is tech-
nological preparation and education for stu-
dents. The world of microcomputers was intro-
duced in all grades in 1982-83 with ten micro-
computers in the school system, Commodores
in the elementary grades and Black Apple IIs in
the high school. Technology was primarily
funded from grocery receipt programs, and
some teachers who opted to allocate money
from elsewhere in their budget. During the
early and mid-1980s, a full-time technology
resource position was funded at the elementary
level and a new position, curriculum coordina-
tor, was created at the middle and high school
with one of the responsibilities being technolo-
gy. Computers were integrated into the cur-

riculum at all levels by those teachers who were
enthusiastic about embracing technology. It
was a grass roots effort.

Toward the end of the decade, the equipment
became obsolete and there was a concentrated
effort to integrate DOS stand-alone machines.
The technology had to mirror the larger world
that was, by this time, 85 percent IBM com-
patible.

In June 1994, a K-12 Technology Task Force
was appointed to develop a comprehensive
technology plan. After lengthy examination and
research, the completed proposal was submit-
ted to the state for review and received notice
from the Virginia Department of Education
that it had been cited as “exemplary.”

A $20,000 donation from the Business In
Education Partnership, generous donations
from the PTAs in all schools, and business con-
tributions helped to get the plan underway.
Most of the teachers in all grades had embraced
and adopted technology. All three schools were
set up on a Local Area Network (LAN) con-
necting every classroom and providing them
with access to the Internet through the LAN.
Every classroom also has at least one computer
workstation to serve instructional, research,
and administrative needs.

In December 1997 a website was launched for
the middle and high schools that contains,
among other items, maps, an interactive calen-
dar, and synopsis of current and pending stu-
dent technology projects.

Future plans call for the creation of a Wide Area
Network (WAN) connecting all school and city
facilities and the installation of a new tele-
phone/voice communications system so that
Falls Church will become a true “electronic vil-
lage.” This will increase communication and
collaboration among students, teachers, and
parents both inside and outside our community.

The school system renewed its commitment to
providing quality professional and curriculum
development for staff members. Technology
training sessions are held for teachers and time
is allowed for instructional collaboration with
colleagues. Training continues throughout the
summer months. Falls Church City school stu-
dents and staff will cross the bridge to the new
century fully prepared.

Local and State Alliances

Falls Church schools have not only internation-
al partners but are fortunate to have two associ-
ations on the local scene. The Business In
Education Partnership (BIE) has successfully
linked our schools and local businesses for
almost 15 years. Through initiatives of the BIE,
new programs have been added. These include
expanded career education, internships, tutor-
ing, and a speakers bureau. In addition, a career
shadowing program for eighth grade students
and a career day for seventh graders allows stu-

dents to meet and work with professionals in
various occupations. The BIE Partnership con-
tinuously supports the school system by provid-
ing annual grants to enhance programs. Over
$100,000 in resources has been given to the
schools. Each year over 150 people are involved
with the students through various programs.

The Northern Virginia Center for Virginia Tech/
University of Virginia also provides interaction
with the schools, particularly at the middle
school and high school levels. Computer wiring
links the center to George Mason enabling a
sharing of facilities. Students from the center

in tutoring and mentoring programs as well. In

May 1998, Falls Church City Public Schools
announced a new partnership with Virginia Tech
University to create a Technology Learning
Center. Virginia Tech is providing funds for
design and construction and George Mason
Middle/High school is providing facilities and
computers. The Technology Learning Center is
available to the school system during the day
and to Virginia Tech in the evenings and on
weekends. George Mason High School students
can access the center to take advanced or spe-
cialized courses as well as communicate with
students in schools around the world. Existing
and new teachers also benefit with opportuni-
ties to improve and enhance their educational
practice.

By the early '90s, George Mason as a facility
was in great need of upgrading and moderniza-
tion in order to meet the educational goals for
6-12th grade students. Since GM opened in
1952, the state and federal governments had
mandated new programs that required addi-
tional space. These included special education
at all grade levels, gifted and talented at all
grade levels, English as a Second language at all
levels, Title IX equal athletic opportunities for
both boys and girls, Family Life and Health for
grades 6-10, computer labs to support comput-
er education, and guidance/career center space.

On February 11, 1991, the City Council passed
a resolution setting a bond referendum sched-
uled for June 4 for the George Mason Middle/
High School (GM) renovation project. Council
action followed two years of study by x archi-
tectural advisory committee and unanimous
approval of the resulting project by the Planning
Commission and School Board. The referendum
passed overwhelmingly, and the ground break-
ing ceremony took place April 2, 1993.

The renovation project created adequate space
for state and federal government mandated
programs as well as provided new learning
areas to accommodate a projected increase in
enrollment. The building was also reconfigured
to provide a more centrally located, separate
and identifiable middle school that would bet-
ter address the unique learning and socializa-
tion needs of the 11-14 year-old student. And
the gymnasium addition met increased needs
for physical education space.

New construction included middle school expan-
sion, high school science laboratories, an auxil-
iary gym, dining room and kitchen and bath-
rooms. Modernization was made with a new
roof, existing gym and locker room improve-
ments, renovation of existing facilities, asbestos
removal, auditorium improvements, and win-
dow/exterior improvements. Additional site and
safety/security improvements were also made.

GM also houses important community assets,
such as its only auditorium, a media center,
the Community Education offices and pro-
grams, and the Channel 38 television studio.
The renovation project included upgrading all
of these areas.

SUPERINTENDENTS

Dear Editor:

My tenure as Superintendent of Falls Church
Public Schools from April 1, 1971 through '
September 30, 1991 was an exciting and satis-
fying time of my 43-year career in education.
Satisfaction in one's career is often achieved
through accomplishments in the position.
With the leadership and assistance of School
Boards, City Councils, citizens of Falls
Church, city managers, principals, teachers,
Warren J. Pace school and city staff members and students,
1971-1991 many changes and programs occurred during

this time.

Irvin H. Schmitt
4949-1965

Today the Falls Church City Public Schools
Dwight E. Knox have a superior reputation, nationally and inter-
1965-1971 nationally, and people desire to locate in the
City for its excellent schools. From the incep-
tion of Falls Church City having its own
schools, achieving excellence has been its
desired goal, and this has permeated through-
out its years of existence. With this promise
though, the 1970s proved to be a time of test-
ing whether or not the City would continue to
have its own schools. | remember vividly being
asked “Will Falls Church continue as a separate
school division?” The enrollment had decreased
to near 1,000, there were three K-6 elementary
schools with many combination grade classes,

34

Patricia Dignan and the per-pupil cost was near the highest in
1995-1997 the area. My answer to the question was an
emphatic yes, but there must be good reasons

a for our system to remain independent. The

Stewart D.  .
Roberson d schools must be different and provide better
1991-1995 opportunities for our children and citizens of

Falls Church than surrounding school divisions.

Now, | would like to summarize some of the
Mary Ellen Shaw changes and progress that occurred to make

1997-present



=== Page 37 ===

Falls Church unique in its educational quality
during my years as Superintendent:

1) Full-day kindergarten with a standard class
size of 20 students taught by one teacher and
one paraprofessional

2) Community Education programs and publi-
cations utilizing Mott Foundation funds as
seed money

3) Before and after-school day care programs
under the auspices of Community Education
4) Renovation of Thomas Jefferson Elementary
School with the addition of the community
gymnasium. This project was completed in
1979 as the first major facilities improvement
following a task force study chaired by
Elizabeth Blystone

5) Changing the grade level organization from
K-6 and 7-12 to K-1; 2-5; 6-8; and 9-12 when
Thomas Jefferson reopened and Madison
Elementary School was closed. This change
included the official designation of the George
Mason Middle School for grades 6, 7, and 8
with its own principal. The change of grades
for Mt. Daniel to K-1 and Thomas Jefferson to
2-5 meant all students in the City of a given
grade attended the same school, which unified
the community following the controversy of
closing an elementary school. Further, the
larger numbers of students per grade eliminat-
ed most combination grade classes.

6) Instituting the International Baccalaureate
Program at George Mason High School in
1981. This program elevated standards of
instruction and brought national and interna-
tional prestige to the school system.

7) Expansion of career and vocational offerings
at George Mason High School through an
agreement with Arlington County for students
to enroll in classes at the Arlington Career
Center.

8) In 1983 George Mason Junior-Senior High
School was recognized by the United States
Department of Education as one of the best
high schools in the nation. When the
Department of Education expanded such
recognition to elementary schools, both
Thomas Jefferson and Mt. Daniel received
similar honors. School officials were presented
with plaques at the White House and congrat-
ulated by the President of the United States.
9) Mt. Daniel Elementary School was renovat-
ed and redesigned as a facility for early child-
hood education, especially for kindergarten
and first grade.

10) Adoption of policies and regulations
requiring excellence in curriculum offerings for
all students, i.e. special education, gifted and
talented. The Curriculum Council, composed
of representative teachers, administrators, and
parents, was organized in the 1970s to make
recommendations to the Superintendent and
School Board for curriculum changes. This was
later incorporated into a policy and regulation.
11) Planning and implementing a Family Life
and Sex Education program as desired by the
citizens of Falls Church prior to a state man-
date.

12) Successful Bond Referendums in 1991 for
renovations and additions to George Mason

High and Middle Schools.

I thank the citizens of Falls Church City, espe-
cially the dedicated School Board members
and other officials, all school staff members,
and students for helping to make my tenure as
Superintendent of Schools an outstanding and
rewarding part of my career. | continue to have
interest and take pride in the excellent Falls

Church City Public Schools.

Warren J. Pace
Superintendent, 1971-1991

Dear Editor:

Thanks for the opportunity to share some of
my reflections on the school system as it pre-
pares to celebrate the rich history it has
enjoyed over the past 50 years. Obviously, my
memories are not as lengthy as some others.

Upon my arrival as superintendent in August
1991, I had the great fortune of following a
gentleman known today as the Superintendent
Emeritus of Falls Church City Public Schools,
Dr. Warren J. Pace. Dr. Pace fostered a high
level of stability and dignity in the position and
in his fine work with the School Board and
community. I derived much inspiration and
counsel from his sterling example as this thirty-
five year old was attracted to a school district of
such fine quality.

A number of factors were at work in 1991
which contributed to more changes beyond
the superintendency, changes which would
extend across the City and its school system.
The City's political parties were engaged in
competition which resulted in close majorities
on a variety of key decisions, some of which
had direct influence on the schools. For
instance, three new School

Board members could

trace their appointments directly to the new
majority which was formed in September
1991, just days after the new superintendent
took office.

By the end of the 1991-92 school year, each of
the school system's four schools had new prin-
cipals at the helm when compared to the
beginning of the previous school year. By this
same time, nine of the ten administrative posi-
tions in the school system were held by indi-
viduals new to their roles or by individuals
with realigned job responsibilities and titles.

Plans were being realized for the renovation or
additions to the school facilities at three of the
four schools. Economic pressures brought on by
the recession and these capital needs created a
set of conditions within which the school bud-
get could experience little expansion, necessi-
tating the reorganization of some services.

Despite these changes and the “natural forces"
which caused them, there was a strongly held
belief that the mission and character of the
schools should be “preserved and enhanced".
This was a theme which I discerned quite read-
ily following the develop-

ment of my “immersion

report’—the document developed after spend-
ing several weeks in individual conferences and
interviews with key stakeholders about the
strengths and challenges of the school system.

From the Immersion Report and subsequent
School Board leadership, a number of agendas
developed which preserved and enhanced the
school district. Among the new fronts on
which we moved together were the following:

#@ The formation of a Leadership Team, com-
prised of all administrators in the school district
e¢ The implementation of the “inclusion pro-
gram"

ee The development of a Strategic Planning
Community Team which produced a five-year
school community plan of action

ee The establishment of George Mason
Middle School as a distinct instructional and
administrative level with reporting responsibil-
ities directly to the Superintendent

e? The development of a revised Student Code
of Conduct

*¢ The establishment of the Technology Task
Force, the Special Education Task Force, and
the Salary Study Task Force, each of which
brought about significant new directions for
the instructional program and school district
employees

*¢ The development of a process of curricu-

lum revision for each subject area in the school
system

*¢ The development of a strong commitment
to the value of professional development as the
key to substantive and positive change; repre-
sented most clearly through the intensive train-
ing featured for new curricular initiatives and
through the Enhancing Teaching and Learning
professional development framework

e> The establishment of an international part-
nership with the American Independent School
of Bolivia

e¢ The reorganization of the district's central
fiscal services, involving stakeholders in the
formation of district fiscal policies

e¢ The preservation of a record as the top per-
forming one in the metro area and within the
Commonwealth on measures of student achieve-
ment

*> The development of a strong and successful
response to the Request For Proposals generated
by the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech
as they sought a new joint location; School
Board members and key School and City senior
staff worked tirelessly to attract the Northern
Virginia Center to Falls Church as a substantive
and symbolic means of preserving the communi-

ty's image as Education City, USA

In 1984 the issue of elected school boards
started gaining momentum in Virginia. At that
time, Virginia was the only state in the US.
that had no elected school boards. Virginia
had elected school boards in earlier years but
had abandoned them because of the integra-
tion issue. By state law, members were appoint-
ed. Two selection methods were used: in 53
counties and all cities, school board members
were appointed by supervisors or City
Councils; in the remaining 42 counties circuit
court judges named selection committees
which appointed board members. In Northern
Virginia, the support for elected boards was
stronger than elsewhere throughout the state,
but it was not public support that was at issue.
It was legislative action. A hearing was held in
Northern Virginia in November 1984 to dis-
cuss pending action by the General Assembly.
Debate took place, but no bill was passed.

Five years later, in 1989, the topic of elected
school boards reached the floor of the Virginia
House of Delegates. After a public hearing, the
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections
defeated the legislation. Falls Church had sup-

ported the proposal provided school boards
have their own taxing powers.

In 1992 the state legislature passed the
Brickley Bill granting local jurisdictions the
option of determining if they wanted to elect
or continue to have appointed school boards.
By early 1993 a petition drive was underway to
have an elected school board in Falls Church.
The drive was successful and in November
1993 City voters went to the polls.

There was moderate voter turnout, but 62 per-
cent of the voters approved elected school
boards. While substantial, this approval rating
was the lowest of the five Northern Virginia
jurisdictions which had the question on the
ballot. In Falls Church City, School Board

members would now be elected at the same



=== Page 43 ===

time as the City Council, and the terms would
b also be the same.

In May 1994, Falls Church's first elected
e School Board members were Sally Ekfelt,
Janice Eklund, Yvette Eldridge and Hal
Lippman. Two years later, May 1996, was the
first contested School Board election in the
City; five candidates ran for three seats. Voters
selected Jason Douglas, John Durham and
Rosemarie Hunziker. On July 1, 1996, for the
first time, the entire School Board was elected

in Falls Church.

Since the Falls Church City Public Schools
began its operation in 1949, approximately
1,100 teachers and administrators have served
City children. As part of the legal agreement
with Fairfax County that brought about the
independent school system, 35 teachers’ con-
tracts were transferred from the County to the
City. The letter of agreement signed by Helen
Regan, Falls Church School Board
Chair, and J.W. Robinson, Fairfax
County School Board Chair, had to
have the approval of the teacher to
accept the teaching assignment in
the newly formed school division.
The new elementary faculty taught
at Madison and the Jefferson
: - Institute. Secondary students con-
ell tinued to attend county schools.

During the early years there was a
great deal of staff turnover. In the
covenants of the contract there was a statement
that the contract would be terminated when a
woman was four months pregnant. The files
indicate that many young teachers left their
positions with few years of experience due to
pregnancy. This language remained until 1970
when it was softened to state that the teacher
could go on unpaid sick leave. After 1974 there
was no further reference. With the Family and
Medical Leave Act of today, both parents are
eligible to take family leave with the birth or
adoption of a child thus providing for greater
continuity of career staff members.

Many teachers in the 1950s had attended nor-
mal school and did not have a college degree.
When Dr. Knox served as the Superintendent,
all non-degreed teachers were given a deadline
in which to receive their diplomas. There was
an exodus of older teachers who were unable to

comply.

Through the decades the requirements for
teacher certification and licensure have
improved drastically. Currently there are 143
teachers employed in Falls Church; 112 have
their master's degrees. Staff development and
keeping current in the ever-changing methods
of teaching are given special emphasis.

During the years of Dr. Pace's superintendency
the staff was very stable. In some years few, if
any, teachers relocated or left the profession. In
recent years many long-tenured faculty have
retired and younger staff have been hired.
There is greater mobility today, and the
turnover remains high as teachers leave for a
variety of reasons. However there is a cadre of
teachers who have been in Falls Church for fif-
teen or more years who are not near retirement
and are providing valuable leadership.

The following staff members served or are con-
tinuing to serve the school system for 25 or
more years: Marge Albert, Greg Alexiou, Jenna
Atkins, Nancy Birindelli, Nancy Brown, Jerry
Bruns, Ruth Busbee, Carol Cofey, Nell Cooper,
Louise Costa, Alva Cottini, Milt Davis, Nancy
DePasquale, Jo Galloway, Jack Gambill, Mary
Lee Gardner, Charlie Harold, Lindy Hocken-
berry, Michael Hoover, Dick Howell, Janet
Kremer, Al Krueger, Phil Lindsey, Anna Link,
Joyce Lowrey, Carol Monsess, Martha Ramey,
Chester Rockwell, Alice Rooney, Mary Ellen
Shaw, Harry Shovlin, Jan Smith, Jim  Spiri-
dopoulos, Rita Wiggs, and Mary Beth Williams.

Education and methods have also exhibited
many changes through the years. The days of
students sitting in rows with the teacher lectur-
ing at the front of the room are long gone. The
students of today are engaged in a variety of
subject areas and are taught by specialists in
their field. At the elementary school these disci-
plines include physical education, music, art,



=== Page 45 ===

ee oe

reading, computer technology, gifted educa-
tion, guidance, and English as a Second
Language. There is much more teaming
through the grades as teachers “co-teach" to
accommodate different student learning styles
and to differentiate instruction.

The area of special education is one which has
experienced tremendous growth in recent years.
Since Falls Church was so small, most seriously
disabled and mentally retarded children were
sent to out-placement locations that could best
provide services. Several years ago these chil-
dren began attending the schools in a program
of inclusion where all students attend class
together. This program has necessitated an
enormous expansion of the special education
staff to include teachers, transition specialists to
assist the students with work experiences, and
paraprofessional staff to work one-on-one with
some children.

Generally, school staff has widened its scope to
encompass additional support personnel. In
Falls Church today, each kindergarten class has
a full-time teacher and a full-time paraprofes-
sional. In first grade the paras are in the class-
room for half the day. The ratio of adults to stu-
dents is very low which accounts for the high
rate of success and low dropout rate as children
cannot become “lost”. Aides have replaced
teachers on the playground and on bus duty. All
teachers now have a duty-free lunch and plan-
ning periods.

Teachers have long been advocates for their own
salary and benefits. In 1959 Superintendent
Schmitt acknowledged in the personnel files of
52 teachers that each had signed a petition in a

salary dispute. In the mid-1980s, the faculty
voted no confidence in the Superintendent and
the School Board over monetary issues. Today
there are two employee advisory groups—one
for professional staff (PEAC) and one for sup-
port staff (SEAC) which make recommenda-
tions to the Superintendent and the School
Board regarding salary, benefits and policy
involving personnel and working conditions.

Several teachers have died while still employed.
Some of the most notable include a popular
math teacher, William Snodgrass, who was acci-
dentally shot and killed by his friend, the Falls
Church police chief, while demonstrating how
to apprehend a thief as they had lunch at the
Falls Church Drug Store in 1957. John Lund,
elementary PE teacher and favorite coach,
drowned while vacationing in Florida. Fatal car
accidents took the lives of Mary Lee Tatum and
Karla Strickland—two teachers greatly beloved
by their students.

The School Board office has relocated several
times since 1949. The first office was at 1057
West Broad Street. The longest tenure was
“above the florist” at 419 West Broad.

For a short time, when enrollments a

43

Nancy

were low and space permitted, the
office was at Mt. Daniel. Three recent

Sprague

moves included 210 East Broad, 301
North Washington and currently 803

West Broad. The School Board meet-

ings were held “above the florist”, then
at Mt. Daniel and now in the Council
Chambers at City Hall where they are

televised live on Channel 38.

Dear Editor:

From 1964 to 1984 I taught French and sometimes
German and Latin at George Mason. I also worked with
the French Club and the French Honor Society. | remem-
ber most my first two years when I met a fine group of
juniors and seniors. They learned somehow and | did also.
The classes took trips to the National Art Gallery, staged a
French poetry competition, many international dinners,
and a concert by a French pianist. | don't do justice to all
the other events, but they were memorable.

THE EDIT

Dear Editor:
I always said the Falls Church school system inher-
ited me rather than getting me by choice. | was
teaching in Madison School when Falls Church
became a city. How thankful I am that the bulk of
my teaching years were with the city school sys-
tem. My twenty-six years there were happy years.
My six-and-seven year old pupils were a delight,
so innocent and honest. One memory that I have
really enjoyed came from a precious little Greek
boy. "You know Miss Worsham, you wouldn't look
so much like an old lady if you didn't have such
white hair!"

Isla Worsham

I was a freshman the first year George Mason Junior/Senior High School opened.
When we started the new school year, classes were held in every part of the new
building since many of the classrooms were not finished. Sometimes there were
eight different classes on the gymnasium floor at one time. Paper was taped to the
gym floor to protect it and was then removed for the basketball games. I also
attended classes in the teachers’ lounge and the main hallway. Most of the stu-
dents from my class had previously attended classes in the old Jefferson School on
North Cherry Street and saw the new George Mason building as a new modern
high school building. Soon we were into the regular routine of high school life at

our new high school on West Broad Street.

John Reimers, Class of 1956

Dear Editor:

The school bell on Monday was never a problem for me. | enjoyed the student
body and personnel of George Mason Junior/Senior High School. It was my
pleasure to teach where | found so much support from the administrators, par-

ents and students.

I must add that the science labs never lacked for supplies or equipment that
the curriculum required. I have toured college laboratories that were not as fully
equipped. Of course, there was one time | had to use a drastic measure to point
up the need for an air conditioner for the chemical supply room. We fried two
eggs on the over-heated floor and it was recorded by the Mustang photogra-
phers. It was amazing how fast the room was air conditioned.

Many of my former students keep in touch. They live enriched lives and are
located in all areas of the U.S. and even abroad.

Dear Editor:
I started teaching as a substitute at Madison School in 1954 and
became a full-time teacher in January 1955. The next school year I
taught at Thomas Jefferson when it first became a part of the Falls
Church school system. | taught third grade for a few years and then
changed to second grade. In June of 1974 I retired.

During these years | saw many changes. I had wonderful students,
great parents and met many terrific teachers. The Falls Church School
System has always been a great one and | am very proud to have been

a part of it.

I began working for the school system Dear Editor:

he looked at me so seriously and said, oe

“Oh, Mrs. Ford—I know why your

I loved working with the children;
the staff was superb. I am quite proud

Falls Church, Virginia!

Dolores Ford

) Dear Editor:
It took all the creativity that “Coach” Joe Crain and I could muster in 1951-52.

| We were to teach Physical Education to the junior and senior high students, but

| we had no gym and very little sports equipment. In inclement weather we could
seldom use a classroom, either. Joe and I made up all sorts of activities, even
building snow figures in the winter. The students could not have had better atti-
tudes, though.

If I were told I had to erase all but one year of teaching from memory, that

first year, using Jefferson Elementary playground and the small, rutted fields at
Thompson House would be my keeper. Not only were the students great, but the
parents were fully supportive and the camaraderie among the faculty was terrific!

Dear Editor:

One of Mr. Irvin Schmitt's desired
goals before he retired as
Superintendent of the Falls Church
schools was to hire a speech and lan-
guage pathologist. During the inter-
view he looked very familiar to me;
and what I said rang a lot of bells
with him; so when we got back to our
respective homes, we checked the
Davenport, lowa's high school year-
book. To our pleasant surprise we dis-
covered he was Superintendent of
Schools in Davenport when | went to
school there. As a matter of fact, he
handed me my diploma when | gradu-
ated from high school. Many years
and many miles later he handed me
my contract in 1965 to fulfill the role
of speech and language pathologist in
the Falls Church schools.

Carol Cofey

Dear Editor:

When I began teaching at GM in 1967, it was an exciting time.
There were lots of new young teachers, some like myself just fresh
from the Peace Corps. Enrollment was growing. There was lots of
experimentation—both in education and in life style choice. In
English we tried innovative mini-courses, which were featured on
a D.C. television station. Sports teams were caught between the
traditional rigorous discipline and the new individualism. At one
point there were much better athletes walking around the halls in
their long hair and beards than there were on our sports teams.
Football, the ultimate establishment sport, was especially hard hit,
with only about 15 kids who were willing to play.

The '70s brought more stability, more seriousness in education
and leveling off and even falling enrollment. In 1975 | started the
first adult education program, which a year later grew into
Community Education. As was the custom, in Falls Church there
was plenty of input and help from the citizens. The School Board
and City Council recognized that with falling enrollments we
needed to open up the schools to all citizens, not just parents of
school aged children. We developed programs for pre-school,
working parents, consumers, dropouts and senior citizens. Falls
Church City Public Schools began to provide for the community
what it had always provided for its students—high quality educa-

tional opportunities in a wide variety of areas.
Bob Smiles

Dear Editor:

My classmates at Mt. Daniel and | were part of the future George Mason High
School class of 1965, the crest of the WWII baby-boomers, and the largest class to
ever traverse the hallowed halls of GM. That distinction, however, certainly had a
downside for many of us.

Because of our size and a concomitant lack of classroom space at George Mason,
the future GM class of 1965 from Mt. Daniel, Thomas Jefferson (TJ), and Madison
Elementary Schools were to be isolated as a group within the confines of the third
floor of TJ to spend our first year of high school at an elementary school!

I can still remember the overwhelming disappointment that we all felt as a result
of that decision. As seventh graders, we would not be taking part in all the things
that we had associated with high school, such as football games (even as puny
sixth graders we had heard about the legends that had been part of GM football in
the '50s — Coach Crain, John Tasker, Ray Peterson, Lance Seidel, and even some
young kid named Carlo), school dances, changing classes, going to Topps, pep
rallies, sock hops, shop classes, wearing a George Mason High School jacket, and
even being kicked around by the dreaded upperclassmen. All of those dreams
| seemed like a very distant and future experience for our class.
| believe the physical constraints of the third floor at TJ that forced all of us
together into six adjacent classrooms helped unite us as a group. The students from
three separate elementary schools were now located together and we quickly
began to identify ourselves as the class of '65. Many of us developed friendships
during that time that have lasted throughout the past 40 years.

Scott Sager, Class of 1965

Dear Editor:
I have many fond memories of the friends and
teachers who passed through GM in the early
1960s. Unfortunately, | never fully appreciated the
tireless efforts of the many excellent teachers who
provided all of us with a sound educational basis
for future life. A special thanks to the teachers and
coaches that I never had a chance to thank. | hope
my son Jimmy, GM class of ‘99, will express his
gratitude to the teachers that have had such a pos-
itive influence on his young life sooner than his
father did!

Bill Laing, Class of 1963

Dear Editor:

In 1967 the marching band was headed to Winchester, Virginia,
to compete in the annual Apple Blossom Festival Parade. We
loaded everything in the school bus, or at least thought we did,
and headed toward Winchester. About half way there someone
noticed that we did not bring the bass drum. We immediately
pulled over and the band director, Mr. Frank Barr, called back to
the school to see if anyone would drive all the way to Winchester
to bring the drum. We thought the chances were slim.

We arrived in Winchester and started marching in the parade
without the drum. It is hard to march in step without that drum
beating out the cadence. Our bass drummer, Rick Sebastian, the
biggest guy in the band, marched playing the gazoo. What a
sight. The parade route winded through the roads of Winchester
for about two miles. It would be extremely hard to find us. When
we were about a quarter mile from the reviewing stand, Mary
McCarthy appeared from nowhere carrying the bass drum. What
a miracle. We stopped so that Rick could put the drum on, hold-
ing up the parade in the process. We were so thrilled at what
happened and the crowd actually starting cheering for us. We
marched on and finished the parade, by then everyone in the
crowd knew what had happened. Our precision marching won us

§ first place in the parade. Later we were shown a tape of our
marching. Our rank and files where perfect. The miracle that
somebody actually hauled that drum to Winchester and found us
resulted in our first place achievement.
