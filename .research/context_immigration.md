# A Little City of Many Nations: How Immigrants Shaped Falls Church

Falls Church, Virginia may be named for an 18th-century Anglican church, but its true character has been shaped by generations of immigrants. From early Irish and German settlers to Vietnamese refugees and Latin American entrepreneurs, diverse communities have built the “Little City” into a vibrant mosaic. This narrative history reframes Falls Church’s story through inclusion and lived experiences, showing how immigrant neighbors transformed a once-homogenous village into a multicultural hometown.

## Early Settlement: From Colonial Church to Immigrant Village

Founded in colonial times, Falls Church took its name from **The Falls Church**, a brick chapel established in 1769 that still stands today ([Photo Gallery • The Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/gallery.aspx?PID=148#:~:text=Originally%20built%20of%20wood%20in,War%2C%20and%20remains%20in%20use)). In those early years, most residents were of British descent – including notable vestrymen like George Washington – and the town’s identity revolved around that one Anglican parish ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=match%20at%20L331%20During%20the,12)). Yet even in the 19th century, new faces began to appear. The coming of turnpikes and railroads drew workers and farmers from afar, and by the 1830s Falls Church “was a growing, prosperous village” attracting newcomers with cheap farmland and opportunity ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359#:~:text=orchards%20providing%20produce%20for%20the,regional%20communication%2C%20earning%20Falls%20Church)). Among these were immigrants from Ireland and Germany seeking better lives amid America’s first great immigration wave. Irish laborers helped build local infrastructure and Irish families – both Protestant Scots-Irish and later Roman Catholics – settled in the area. In fact, by 1874 a Catholic mission had been established in Falls Church (St. James Church) to serve the burgeoning Irish and German Catholic community ([](https://fallschurch-va.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&clip_id=1216&meta_id=93359#:~:text=established%20in%201856%2C%20allowed%20people,by%20the%20Congregational%20Church%20in)). The *Falls Church Gazette* of the era might have noted English, Gaelic, and German accents mingling at the market or tavern. By the turn of the 20th century, Italian newcomers joined the mix as part of a nationwide influx of Southern Europeans, and Eastern European Jewish families began planting roots across Northern Virginia ([](https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/history-commission/sites/history-commission/files/Assets/documents/Events/2022-FCHC-Conference-Report.pdf#:~:text=Society.%20The%20firstsynagogue,Germany%20and%20later%20Eastern%20Europe)). Falls Church was still a small Southern town, but the seeds of diversity were being planted with each new immigrant family that made the village their home.

## Southeast Asian Refuge: From Little Saigon to Eden Center

 ([File:Eden Center arch.jpg – Travel guide at Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/File:Eden_Center_arch.jpg)) **Vietnamese immigrants transformed a former strip mall into Eden Center, now a cultural hub and one of Falls Church’s top destinations ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=Eden%20Center%20is%20a%20Vietnamese,m%C3%AC%20delicatessens%2C%20bakeries%2C%20markets%2C%20as)).** In the late 20th century, global events brought a dramatic new wave of immigrants to Falls Church. One pivotal moment was the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Thousands of Vietnamese refugees arrived in Northern Virginia, fleeing war and political upheaval. Many initially clustered in Arlington’s Clarendon neighborhood, which became known as “Little Saigon” in the 1970s. Rising rents and Metrorail construction eventually pushed these Vietnamese businesses out of Clarendon, and in the 1980s they relocated en masse just a few miles west to Falls Church ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20plaque%20tells%20the%20story,Falls%20Church%20during%20the%201980s)). There, in a down-at-heel shopping plaza off Wilson Boulevard, Vietnamese entrepreneurs found a new home. They opened phở restaurants, bánh mì bakeries, grocery stores, jewelry shops, and more – creating what is now **Eden Center**, the largest Vietnamese commercial center on the East Coast ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=Eden%20Center%20is%20a%20Vietnamese,m%C3%AC%20delicatessens%2C%20bakeries%2C%20markets%2C%20as)). 

Eden Center quickly became *the* gathering place for Vietnamese Americans in the Washington, D.C. region. Over 120 shops and eateries sprang to life behind its iconic gateway, and the aroma of fragrant soup and the sound of Vietnamese language soon filled the air ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=home%20to%20more%20than%20120,3)). By one account, the Washington area today hosts the third-largest Vietnamese community in the United States, and Eden Center is its heart ([Falls Church Vietnamese community to get historical marker | Tysons Reporter](https://www.tysonsreporter.com/2021/08/13/virginia-historical-marker-falls-church-vietnamese-community-eden-center/#:~:text=settled%20in%20Arlington%E2%80%99s%20Clarendon%20neighborhood,and%2C%20later%2C%20Falls%20Church)). “It’s a place that is really a cultural touch point – not only for the Vietnamese community, but for all of Northern Virginia,” said Falls Church Mayor David Tarter ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20place%20that%20is,for%20all%20of%20Northern%20Virginia%2C%E2%80%9D)). The shopping center’s parking lots come alive during festivals like Tết (Lunar New Year), when lion dancers and firecrackers celebrate Vietnamese heritage on Virginia soil. In May 2022, a Virginia historical marker was unveiled at Eden Center honoring the Vietnamese immigrant journey – a project initiated by local middle school students proud of their city’s diversity ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20historical%20marker%20only%20became,Historical%20Marker%20contest%20and%20won)) ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20plaque%20tells%20the%20story,Falls%20Church%20during%20the%201980s)). As one Vietnamese American elder noted at the ceremony, refugees arriving with little more than hope “bring along a wealth of history and culture,” enriching Falls Church with values of resilience and community ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=Trinh%20Mau,see%20the%20sign%20go%20up)). The success of Eden Center – now Falls Church’s top tourist destination – stands as a testament to how immigrants rebuilt an abandoned strip mall into a thriving cultural marketplace ([Eden Center - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Center#:~:text=Eden%20Center%20is%20a%20Vietnamese,m%C3%AC%20delicatessens%2C%20bakeries%2C%20markets%2C%20as)). In doing so, they revitalized the city’s economy and expanded its identity beyond anything imagined in colonial days.

## Hispanic and Latin American Heritage in Falls Church

Another major chapter in Falls Church’s immigrant story has been written by people from Latin America. Beginning in the late 20th century, immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Bolivia, and other Latin American nations settled in the city and surrounding areas. Some came as refugees fleeing civil wars and unrest in the 1980s; others arrived in search of economic opportunity in the booming D.C. suburbs. Over the decades, the Latino population in Falls Church grew steadily – from about 9% of residents in 2000 to over 10% by 2020 ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=the%20Latino%20population%20according%20to,S%20Census)) ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=Some%20Other%20Race%20%20alone,100.00)). That may sound modest, but it represents the fastest growth of any demographic in the city during that time ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20U,Falls%20Church%20is%20no%20exception)). More importantly, Latino residents have become a vital thread in the community’s fabric, starting businesses, raising families, and sharing their culture with their neighbors.

Walk down South Washington Street on a Sunday after church, and you might spot a line of patrons waiting outside **Pupuseria La Familiar**, a local Salvadoran eatery famous for its pupusas. Inside, tables overflow with families enjoying warm corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, pork, and beans – a taste of home for many and a delicious discovery for others. “A family of four can eat here for under $20 and that’s what many area Latin Americans do on Sundays,” the restaurant’s manager, Wendy Marquez, told a reporter ([2022-09-19 - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/09/19/#:~:text=name%20it%2C%20with%20prices%20from,50)). Scenes like this play out across Falls Church, from taco trucks to Peruvian chicken joints, as Hispanic entrepreneurs energize the culinary scene (and local economy) with flavors from across the Americas. The Latino community’s contributions go well beyond food: they include construction firms, landscaping and cleaning businesses, professional services, and cultural organizations. Decades ago, local activists founded the Hispanic Committee of Virginia to help newcomers adjust; today, its legacy continues through programs at the **Falls Church Multicultural Center**, which provides bilingual childcare, job training, and small-business support to immigrant families ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20Falls%20Church%20Multicultural%20Center,and%20provide%20much%20needed%20benefits)) ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=One%20such%20organization%20dedicated%20to,to%20say%20on%20their%20website)). At this center, one can hear Spanish, but also Arabic, French, Farsi, and Amharic spoken – a reminder that “Northern Virginia is a diverse community” and the staff “represent the community we are in,” as director Paola Sandoval-Moshenberg puts it ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20hiring%20people%20working%20directly,%E2%80%9D)) ([Latino Heritage Month in Falls Church - Falls Church News-Press Online](https://www.fcnp.com/2022/10/13/latino-heritage-month-in-falls-church/#:~:text=As%20Paola%20put%20it%2C%20%E2%80%9CWe,%E2%80%9D)). Latino residents have also woven themselves into the civic life of Falls Church: coaching youth soccer, leading PTA meetings, and organizing vibrant fiestas for Hispanic Heritage Month. What was once a sleepy Southern town now hosts salsa dancing in the community center and bilingual story times at the library. The sights, sounds, and success stories of Latino Falls Church underscore how immigrants have invigorated the city’s culture while pursuing their American dreams.

## New Neighbors from the Middle East and Africa

Falls Church’s evolution into a multicultural haven continued in the 1990s and 2000s with growing communities from the Middle East and Africa. Alongside Latino markets and Asian restaurants, one can find halal meat shops, Ethiopian cafés, and the dome of a mosque in the skyline. In 1983, local Muslim families established the **Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center** in a former bank building near Seven Corners to serve a rapidly expanding Islamic population. Chosen for its accessible location on Route 7 in greater Falls Church, Dar Al-Hijrah opened its current mosque in 1991 and today draws worshipers from across Northern Virginia ([History – Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center](https://archive.hijrah.org/about-us/history/#:~:text=original%20masjid,Hijrah%20Islamic%20Center%20has%20been)). The center estimates some 40,000 Muslims live in the area it serves ([History – Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center](https://archive.hijrah.org/about-us/history/#:~:text=suburban%20regions%20that%20constitute%20the,The%20Muslim)) – including immigrants and refugees from countries like Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Pakistan, as well as American-born descendants. Every week, the parking lot fills for Friday prayers as Arabic, Urdu, and English chatter mix in the halls. Beyond religion, the mosque has become a community hub offering refugee resettlement help, food drives, and after-school programs, reflecting Falls Church’s ethos of neighbors helping neighbors. Nearby, Middle Eastern and North African entrepreneurs have opened businesses that contribute to the city’s prosperity – from Persian kebab eateries and Lebanese bakeries to pan-Arab grocery stores catering to tastes of home.

Likewise, immigrants from Africa – especially East Africa – have established a vibrant presence. In fact, **Falls Church is now home to “Little Ethiopia”**, one of the region’s largest Ethiopian and Eritrean enclaves. Nowhere is this more evident than at the Build America Plaza, a nondescript strip mall at Bailey’s Crossroads that has been completely transformed by Ethiopian-owned establishments. “Dozens of restaurants, markets, butcher shops, and bakeries there are all Ethiopian,” *Washingtonian* magazine noted, calling the plaza the closest thing to the Ethiopian community’s downtown ([This Falls Church Plaza Is One of the Area's Top Destinations for Ethiopian Food](https://www.washingtonian.com/2023/09/07/experience-ethiopian-cuisine-at-these-local-restaurants-and-markets/#:~:text=Build%20America%20Plaza%20sits%20between,Shirlington%20and%20Bailey%E2%80%99s%20Crossroads)). On any given evening, the aroma of berbere spice and roasting coffee fills the air as friends gather over injera and lentil stew, and Amharic conversations hum in the background. Longtime residents recall that decades earlier this area had Vietnamese and Korean shops; today, it’s Ethiopian eateries and even a little Somali café – a testament to the ever-changing tapestry of immigrant neighborhoods. One Ethiopian restaurateur, Rahel Kassa, described achieving her dream of opening a business here after arriving as a student in 1999. She now serves authentic *kitfo* (seasoned steak tartare) to customers who drive from across Virginia just to taste the real thing ([This Falls Church Plaza Is One of the Area's Top Destinations for Ethiopian Food](https://www.washingtonian.com/2023/09/07/experience-ethiopian-cuisine-at-these-local-restaurants-and-markets/#:~:text=Co,pounds%20of%20kitfo%20to%20go)) ([This Falls Church Plaza Is One of the Area's Top Destinations for Ethiopian Food](https://www.washingtonian.com/2023/09/07/experience-ethiopian-cuisine-at-these-local-restaurants-and-markets/#:~:text=Butchers%20play%20a%20vital%20role,beef%20scooped%20up%20with%20injera)). Such success stories abound: West African immigrants have launched tech startups; Egyptians and Moroccans have opened popular hookah lounges; Nigerians and Ghanaians have formed lively congregations at local churches. These newcomers have added their threads to Falls Church’s multicultural fabric, ensuring that no single culture or language dominates the “Little City.” Instead, a visitor can experience a world of traditions – East African music, Middle Eastern hospitality, South Asian festivals – all within a few square miles.

## An Evolving Identity: From “Falls Church” to a Mosaic of Cultures

 ([Photo Gallery • The Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/gallery.aspx?PID=148)) **The historic Falls Church (built 1769) still stands as a reminder of the city’s colonial roots ([Photo Gallery • The Falls Church](https://www.fallschurchva.gov/gallery.aspx?PID=148#:~:text=Originally%20built%20of%20wood%20in,War%2C%20and%20remains%20in%20use)). Today, it shares the landscape with temples, mosques, and cultural centers introduced by newer residents.** The ongoing story of Falls Church is one of transformation – from a colonial outpost centered on *one* church to a dynamic community enriched by many voices. This contrast is even embedded in the city’s name and origin narrative. In 1776, residents gathered on the steps of The Falls Church to hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence ([Falls Church, Virginia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church,_Virginia#:~:text=match%20at%20L331%20During%20the,12)), their world defined largely by English customs and Protestant faith. Fast forward to today: nearly **one in five Falls Church residents was born outside the United States** ([Eight things to know about the growth of Virginia's immigrant community - Cardinal News](https://cardinalnews.org/2022/12/27/seven-things-to-know-about-the-growth-of-virginias-immigrant-community/#:~:text=That%20may%20not%20surprise%20anyone,2)), and the city’s streetscape features Vietnamese signage, Spanish-language church services, and the bright colors of international markets. The old brick church – the city’s namesake – remains a cherished landmark and active Episcopal parish, but it no longer defines what it means to belong here. On any given weekend, a Falls Church local might attend a Persian Nowruz celebration, a West African dance performance, or a Latin American food festival. The community has embraced its diversity with events like **Welcoming Week**, where longtime residents and newcomers share their stories and culture. City leaders have also formally recognized immigrant contributions – for example, by designating an honorary “**Saigon Boulevard**” in front of Eden Center to celebrate the Vietnamese-American legacy. Such gestures underscore Falls Church’s commitment to being an inclusive hometown.

In many ways, the journey of Falls Church mirrors the broader American experience – a nation continually renewed by the hopes, labor, and creativity of those who arrive from elsewhere. But on a local level, it has taken conscious effort and activism to weave a unified community. Immigrants in Falls Church did not simply assimilate into a pre-existing story; they reshaped the story. They opened businesses that revitalized commercial districts ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20plaque%20tells%20the%20story,Falls%20Church%20during%20the%201980s)), led civic initiatives (from PTA boards to human rights advocacy), and brought global perspectives to the town’s civic debates. Over time, the city’s conception of its own history has expanded to include these voices. Instead of only celebrating Revolutionary War heroes or Civil War sites, Falls Church now honors Vietnamese refugees and other immigrant trailblazers with historical markers and public tributes ([Eden Center, Vietnamese immigrants honored with historical marker in Falls Church - WTOP News](https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/05/eden-center-vietnamese-immigrants-honored-with-historical-marker-in-falls-church/#:~:text=The%20historical%20marker%20only%20became,Historical%20Marker%20contest%20and%20won)). The narrative has shifted from one of *exclusion* – in the early 1900s, Falls Church infamously attempted to segregate African-American residents at Tinner Hill – to one of *inclusion*, where diversity is seen as a strength. 

As we look around Falls Church today, we see a community that truly lives up to its nickname, “The Little City,” in the sense that it encapsulates the broader world. A short stroll can take you from a colonial-era churchyard to a bustling Asian market, past an Ethiopian café to a Central American pupusería, and onward to a Middle Eastern mosque – all within city limits. This rich cultural quilt did not form overnight; it was woven by countless individual journeys and the hard work of immigrant families laying down roots. Falls Church’s identity has evolved from a singular narrative of colonial heritage to a pluralistic celebration of many heritages. And in that evolution lies a powerful message: that the city’s true legacy is not just the bricks of an old church, but the lives of its people – *all* its people, from the descendants of its founders to the newest refugees – who together have created a more inclusive and vibrant Falls Church.

This diversity contrasts with the city’s colonial-era makeup and the singular cultural perspective implied by its name. Today, multiple cultures and faiths thrive in Falls Church, redefining its identity in the image of its immigrant communities.
