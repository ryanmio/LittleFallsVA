# Taylor's Tavern: A Civil War Landmark in Falls Church

## Historical Overview

Taylor's Tavern was a significant historical landmark in what is now the Seven Corners area of Falls Church, Virginia. The two-story structure stood at a strategic location on Leesburg Pike (now Route 7) near its intersection with the Alexandria-Georgetown Road (now Wilson Boulevard), making it an important waypoint for travelers in Northern Virginia during the early 19th century.

Built in the early 1800s, the tavern was owned and operated by Richard Taylor and his family, serving as both an inn for travelers and a gathering place for locals. Its position on high ground made it a natural observation point overlooking the surrounding countryside, a feature that would later prove tactically significant during the Civil War.

## Strategic Importance During the Civil War

When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Taylor's Tavern gained new significance as a military outpost due to its strategic location. The tavern sat approximately 5 miles from Washington, D.C., at the forward edge of Union-held territory after Virginia's secession. Several factors contributed to its military importance:

1. **Elevated Position**: The tavern was situated on one of the highest points in the area, providing excellent visibility of the surrounding countryside and approaches to Washington.

2. **Road Junction**: It controlled a crucial intersection of major transportation routes between Washington, Alexandria, and points west in Virginia.

3. **Forward Outpost**: As Union forces established a defensive perimeter around Washington, Falls Church became an important advanced position, with Taylor's Tavern serving as one of the forward outposts.

By June 1861, Union forces had established a significant presence at Taylor's Tavern, using it as a base for patrols and reconnaissance into Confederate-held territory deeper in Fairfax County.

## Professor Lowe's Balloon Ascension

Taylor's Tavern gained its most notable place in history on June 24, 1861, when Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe chose it as the launch site for what would become the first military aerial reconnaissance mission in American history. The tavern's elevated position made it an ideal location from which to conduct balloon observations.

From the grounds of Taylor's Tavern, Lowe launched his hydrogen-filled balloon "Enterprise" on several tethered ascents, rising several hundred feet to survey Confederate positions around Fairfax Court House and beyond. During these ascensions, Lowe was accompanied by Major Leyard Colburn of the 2nd Connecticut Infantry, who sketched maps of enemy positions visible from their aerial vantage point.

The information gathered during these balloon observations provided valuable intelligence to Union commanders, allowing them to assess Confederate troop dispositions and fortifications. This pioneering use of aerial reconnaissance at Taylor's Tavern marked the beginning of American military aviation and established the site's significance in military history.

## Changing Hands During the War

In the months following First Bull Run (July 21, 1861), Taylor's Tavern and the surrounding Falls Church area became contested ground. Confederate forces under Colonel J.E.B. Stuart advanced to occupy nearby Munson's Hill and Upton's Hill, effectively pushing the front line back toward Washington and temporarily placing Taylor's Tavern in Confederate-held territory.

During August and September 1861, the tavern likely served as an observation post for Confederate forces. By late September, as McClellan's reorganized Union Army began to push outward from Washington, Confederate forces withdrew from the immediate Falls Church area, and Taylor's Tavern once again came under Union control.

For the remainder of the war, the tavern remained within Union lines, serving various military functions. The Union Army constructed nearby fortifications including Fort Taylor, Fort Buffalo, and Fort Ramsay to secure the high ground around Falls Church and prevent any further Confederate advance toward Washington.

## Post-War History and Legacy

After the Civil War, Taylor's Tavern returned to civilian use, though its prominence as a wayside inn diminished with changing transportation patterns. The original structure no longer stands today, as development in the rapidly growing Seven Corners area led to its eventual demolition.

The site where Taylor's Tavern once stood is now part of the heavily developed commercial district of Seven Corners in Fairfax County. Despite the physical loss of the tavern, its historical significance has been recognized with a historical marker that commemorates both the tavern itself and Professor Lowe's groundbreaking balloon ascension that occurred there.

Taylor's Tavern represents an important piece of both Fairfax County and American military history. As the launch site of the first military aerial reconnaissance mission, it marks the birthplace of American military aviation and serves as a reminder of Falls Church's significant role in the early stages of the Civil War.
