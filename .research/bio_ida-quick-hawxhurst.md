# Ida Quick Hawxhurst (Civic Leader and Suffragist)

## Background and Arrival in Falls Church

Ida E. Quick Hawxhurst (1867–1952) was an influential civic leader in Falls Church whose lifetime spanned the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Born in Flemington, New Jersey, Ida Quick moved to Falls Church in 1889 as a young woman. In 1891 she married George W. Hawxhurst, a prominent Falls Church resident (himself later a town mayor and postmaster). This marriage connected her to a locally distinguished family – the Hawxhursts were Quakers who had been Unionists during the Civil War and active in Northern Virginia public life. Once settled in Falls Church, Ida Quick Hawxhurst immersed herself in community service. She joined the **Columbia Baptist Church** and over the next six decades was one of its stalwart members, serving as the church organist and a Sunday school teacher at various times. She also participated in the church's benevolent societies, such as the Ladies' Aid Society and the Baptist Women's Missionary Society, reflecting her devotion to faith-based community work. A notice in her later years described her as having been the longtime treasurer of the Baptist Women's Missionary Society of the Potomac Association – indicating a leadership role that extended beyond Falls Church into regional church networks. Hawxhurst's early involvement in church and charitable groups laid the groundwork for her emergence as a civic leader in a era when formal political roles for women were few.

## Civic Organizations and "Municipal Housekeeping"

Like many progressive women of the early 20th century, Ida Hawxhurst wielded influence through clubs and reform organizations. She was an **active member and officer in several fraternal and temperance groups** in Falls Church. For example, she belonged to the local chapter of the **Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU)** – a national organization championing temperance, moral reform, and eventually women's suffrage. She also joined the **Good Templars**, an international temperance fraternity, and the **Rebekah Lodge** (the women's auxiliary of the Odd Fellows fraternal order). Additionally, she was involved in the Order of the Eastern Star, the Masonic-affiliated women's group. These affiliations show how Hawxhurst and her peers created alternative power structures in a male-dominated society; through club offices and committee chairmanships, women like her could exercise leadership, organize initiatives, and shape civic life. In Falls Church, Ida Hawxhurst played a direct role in local improvement projects. She was a member of the **Falls Church Village Improvement Society (VIS)**, a co-ed civic group founded in 1885 to beautify and modernize the town. VIS undertook efforts such as tree planting, sanitation campaigns, and establishing a public library. Indeed, by 1899 the VIS had founded the first Falls Church library, and the Hawxhurst family was deeply involved – the small lending collection was initially housed in a shed behind George and Ida Hawxhurst's home at N. Washington & E. Columbia Streets, and George Hawxhurst acted as the volunteer librarian. Ida surely aided in these library efforts, as the books were literally on her property. In 1913, she helped organize a local women's group known as the **Falls Church Civic League**, which soon took over management of the fledgling library. (The Civic League was essentially an early incarnation of the Falls Church Woman's Club – it was an all-female volunteer association dedicated to civic improvement and "municipal housekeeping.") Ida Quick Hawxhurst was a **charter member of the first Falls Church Woman's Club** when it formally organized, and she remained active in it for decades. This club (initially the Civic League) not only ran the public library from 1913 to 1949 but also sponsored lectures, beautification projects, and charitable drives. Through these avenues, Hawxhurst and other women indirectly shaped local policy and public services at a time when they could not yet vote or hold elected office. Her talent for organization and finance (evidenced by roles like club treasurer) helped sustain these institutions. In sum, Ida Hawxhurst exemplified the concept of "municipal mothering" – women taking responsibility for the welfare of their community via clubs and churches. By leveraging such civic organizations, she and her contemporaries asserted a form of power parallel to the male-run Town Council.

## Leader in the Suffrage Movement

Hawxhurst's most significant political engagement was in the campaign for women's suffrage. In 1913, she co-founded and became a leader of the **Women's Suffrage League of Fairfax County**. This local league was likely an affiliate of the state suffrage organization and aimed to rally support in the Falls Church/Fairfax area for granting women the right to vote. Ida Hawxhurst and her colleagues (including other prominent local women like Emma "Mattie" Gundry) organized meetings, distributed literature, and petitioned officials as part of this effort. Historical records indicate that Mrs. George Hawxhurst (Ida) was regarded highly enough to take on leadership beyond Falls Church: she was **one of the founders of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia (ESL)** and even served as **president of the Arlington County suffrage league** during the 1910s. (At the time, Falls Church straddled Fairfax and the newly named Arlington County, and suffragists likely coordinated across county lines.) The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia, formed in 1909, was the primary statewide organization campaigning for women's voting rights. If Ida Hawxhurst was indeed among its founding members and leaders, it places her in the company of Virginia suffrage pioneers like Lila Meade Valentine, Adele Clark, and Nora Houston. It also suggests she traveled to suffrage conventions and lobbied state legislators in Richmond. Locally, Hawxhurst's Suffrage League of Fairfax held lectures and might have staged suffrage rallies or participated in Washington, D.C. demonstrations (the famous 1913 Woman Suffrage Parade in D.C. took place the same year their league formed). We know that nationally, the suffragist movement was in full swing by the 1910s, and in Northern Virginia, women organized fundraisers and "suffrage teas." Ida Hawxhurst continued to agitate for the vote through World War I; she did not relent until the **19th Amendment was finally ratified in 1920**, achieving women's suffrage. Newspaper accounts from the period mention Falls Church suffragists hosting speakers – for instance, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw (then president of NAWSA) visited the area in 1910, which likely galvanized local activists like Hawxhurst. Her commitment and networking skills would have been crucial in recruiting members to the cause. It's important to note that the suffrage movement in Virginia often had to position itself carefully on racial issues to gain white male support. As a white suffragist, Hawxhurst operated within a segregated movement. The Equal Suffrage League of Virginia barred Black women from membership and explicitly avoided advocating for Black voting rights. Hawxhurst and her fellow ESL members argued for votes for women while tacitly (and sometimes overtly) reassuring white voters and legislators that this would not threaten white supremacy. In 1915 – the same year Falls Church's white leaders were enacting residential segregation – the ESL under leaders like Valentine "toed the line of Jim Crow politics" by clarifying they sought the vote for white women only. This uncomfortable compromise was seen as necessary political expediency in the South. We do not have Ida Hawxhurst's personal words on the subject, but given her prominence in the ESL, she almost certainly upheld the organization's stance of excluding African American women. There is no evidence that Hawxhurst objected to this policy; like most white suffragists of her era, her focus was on gender equality for (white) women, not racial integration. In fact, Black women in Virginia formed their own clubs and suffrage efforts separate from the ESL. Thus, while Ida Hawxhurst was progressive on women's rights, she, along with the movement she belonged to, largely **ignored racial justice issues** of the time. For example, during the 1915 Falls Church segregation ordinance crisis prompted by Mayor Herndon, there's no record of suffragist women like Hawxhurst speaking out against that racist law – their public advocacy was channeled elsewhere. This illustrates the intersectional blind spots in early 20th-century progressivism.

Notably, the ESL of Virginia was an all-white organization – Black women were not admitted, reflecting the racial limits of the suffrage campaign in the South.*

## Impact on Falls Church Civic Life

Through her church work, club leadership, and suffrage activism, Ida Quick Hawxhurst helped shape Falls Church's civic evolution in the early 1900s. In an era when women could not hold public office (and even after 1920, few women were immediately elected), she exercised influence behind the scenes. For instance, the library that the Civic League/Woman's Club maintained eventually grew into today's Mary Riley Styles Public Library – a cornerstone of the community. Hawxhurst's generation of women kept the library alive through volunteer labor and fundraising until the town began supporting it in the late 1920s. She also served on the board of the **Oakwood Cemetery Association**, helping oversee the town's primary cemetery, and participated in the **Village Improvement Society's** drives for infrastructure upgrades (like better roads and lighting). Each of these contributions improved quality of life in Falls Church. Moreover, Hawxhurst's suffrage work meant that by 1920 a substantial number of Falls Church women were registered and ready to vote. We can infer that she likely joined the League of Women Voters thereafter to educate new voters (many local ESL chapters transformed into League of Women Voters chapters after the 19th Amendment). Indeed, by the 1920s and 1930s, Falls Church women's clubs – including the Woman's Club which Ida helped found – took on projects such as health clinics, school improvements, and charity bazaars. These clubs gave women a voice on civic issues before they were represented in City Council. In a telling example of their influence: In 1924, Falls Church named its first public high school after a woman (Miss Jessie Thackrey) at a time when the school board was still all-male – a decision likely encouraged by women's advocacy. While Ida Hawxhurst was not an outspoken political radical, she was part of the moderate reformist fabric of Falls Church. Her style was very much that of a **pragmatic community organizer**: she worked within existing social structures (church, family, and approved women's groups) to gradually expand women's roles and address community needs. Her approach exemplified how Falls Church's white middle-class women claimed a form of power in a male-dominated society – by proving themselves indispensable in education, religion, and social services, and by lobbying for the vote as a natural extension of their civic responsibilities.

## Relations with Racial Justice Efforts

A complex aspect of Ida Hawxhurst's legacy is the apparent disconnect between the women's rights progressivism she championed and the racial segregation and inequality that persisted in Falls Church. As noted, the mainstream suffrage movement in Virginia largely sidelined Black women. There is no indication that Hawxhurst challenged this paradigm; on the contrary, she operated in segregated circles. For example, while she worked with and likely taught Sunday school to white children at Columbia Baptist Church, Black residents in Falls Church at the time had separate churches and schools. The Falls Church Woman's Club she helped lead was an all-white club; African American women formed their own groups (like the Colored Women's League in nearby communities) without crossover. During the 1930s and 1940s, some Falls Church white women did begin to engage in interracial activism (for instance, Mary Ellen Henderson, a Black educator in Falls Church, collaborated with a few white allies to address school inequalities in the 1940s), but there's no record that Ida Hawxhurst was among them. By that time, she was aging and less publicly active. It appears that **Hawxhurst's reform agenda did not extend to racial integration or civil rights for Black citizens**. This was typical of many white progressives of her generation – they fought for temperance, suffrage, and civic betterment, but accepted or at least did not openly contest the Jim Crow social order. Her priorities were women's enfranchisement and community service within her own racial community. In evaluating her legacy today, this limitation is acknowledged: she helped advance women's equality in Falls Church, but the benefits of her work mostly accrued to white women like herself. The causes she championed (voting rights, education, temperance) were certainly worthy, yet they didn't directly confront racial injustice, which remained a "blind spot" in the early 20th-century women's movement.

## Legacy and Modern Reflections

Ida Quick Hawxhurst is remembered in Falls Church as a model of civic engagement and as a pioneer for women's political empowerment. In recent years, local historians have highlighted her contributions during Women's History Month and on history walks through the city. She exemplifies the kind of grassroots leadership that kept the community running and pushed it slowly toward progress. Thanks to leaders like her, by the time women gained the vote in 1920, Falls Church had a cadre of informed women ready to participate in public life. The Falls Church Women's History Walk project describes her as "Exemplary, Involved, Engaged Citizen and Community Leader," which is borne out by her lifelong resume of service. Hawxhurst's work also paved the way for the next generations of women in Falls Church – for instance, the first women to hold office in the city in the 1950s and 60s were likely inspired by the civic paths she helped forge. Modern observers, however, also place her story in the "complex and contested" context of Falls Church's past. While celebrating her achievements, historians note that the **progressivism of Falls Church's white leaders coexisted with, and sometimes abetted, segregation**. This dual legacy prompts reflection on how social change occurs – often incrementally and within prevailing biases. In Hawxhurst's case, her legacy is one of expanding gender equity in Falls Church's civic realm: from church halls to city halls, women like her earned respect as organizers and advocates. Yet the fullness of time has also led the community to ask who was absent from her narrative, namely Falls Church's Black women who fought their own parallel battles (like educator **Mary Ellen Henderson**, who in the 1930s-40s led efforts to equalize Black schools). Today, Falls Church honors Ida Hawxhurst for her indispensable role in its development, while also striving to tell a more inclusive history. Her name might not be as nationally known as some suffragists, but locally it stands among those who laid the civic foundations of "The Little City." In summary, Ida Quick Hawxhurst's life tells a story of female agency in an age of disenfranchisement: she helped build up Falls Church's institutions, secured the vote for women, and demonstrated the power of community activism – all while navigating the constraints of her time. Her journey, like Falls Church's, reflects both the strides of progress and the shortcomings that later generations would need to address on the road toward social justice.
