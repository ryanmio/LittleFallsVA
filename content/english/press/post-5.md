As our movement continues to grow, we're grateful to the many community members who have shared why they support changing our city's name to Little Falls. Here, we've collected some of their perspectives.

> "When I first moved here, I was confused why a diverse city was named after a single church. Little Falls honors our natural geography and indigenous history while creating space for all faiths and backgrounds."
> 
> *Maria Johnson, 15-year resident*

> "The name Little Falls actually has deeper historical roots than many realize. It reconnects us with the original landscape features that drew people to this area long before colonization."
>
> *Robert Chen, local historian*

> "As a young person who will inherit this city, I want a name that feels welcoming to everyone. Little Falls sounds peaceful, natural, and doesn't center one religion over others."
>
> *Aisha Patel, high school student*

The Little Falls Movement continues to gather signatures for our petition and engage with city leadership about the possibilities for a name change. We believe that through respectful dialogue and grassroots organizing, we can build consensus around a name that better represents our community's values and diversity.

If you'd like to add your voice to this growing chorus, please sign our petition and join us at our next community meeting.
