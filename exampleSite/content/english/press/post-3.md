Committee for Little Falls Highlights Rationale Behind Proposed Name Change

Little Falls, VA - June 01, 2023 - The Committee for Little Falls has released a statement outlining the rationale behind proposing "Little Falls" as the new name for Falls Church, Virginia. This statement aims to address questions and concerns from the community and provide a clear understanding of the name's significance.

The rationale behind the proposed name change can be summarized in three key points:

### Inclusivity:
The name "Little Falls" promotes inclusivity by removing the connection to a specific church and religion, making the city more welcoming to people of all faiths and beliefs. This change seeks to foster unity and understanding among the diverse population that calls the city home.

### Geographical and historical connections:
The name "Little Falls" emphasizes the city's proximity to the great falls of the Potomac River and highlights its status as the smallest city in Virginia. This name respects the city's historical and geographical connections without associating it with a specific church or religion. Additionally, it acknowledges the city's origins at the intersection of significant Native American trails.

### Growth and development: 
Adopting the name "Little Falls" symbolizes a fresh start and a commitment to embracing continued growth and development in the city. This name change demonstrates a dedication to creating a more inclusive and diverse environment for all residents, while fostering a sense of pride in the city's unique characteristics.

The Committee for Little Falls invites the community to engage in open discussions about the proposed name change and welcomes feedback on the rationale provided. The committee is committed to working together with the residents to build a more inclusive and welcoming city for everyone.
