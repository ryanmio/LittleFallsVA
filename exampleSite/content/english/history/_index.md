    <h2 class="chapter-title">Pre-colonial era: Indigenous peoples inhabit the area</h2>
    <p>Long before European colonizers arrived, this land was home to Indigenous peoples, including the Tauxenents, Patawomekes, and Matchotics of the Iroquois Confederacy. As inhabitants of the area, they revered the Little Falls of the Potomac River, a barrier to navigation and a gathering place for trade and communication. Little Falls was not only a significant landmark but also a testament to the rich history of the Indigenous peoples who called this land their home.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1734: Truro Parish established</h2>
    <p>In 1734, Truro Parish was established, and settlers began to arrive, disrupting the lives of the native inhabitants. As newcomers built homes and established communities, they inadvertently transformed the Native American trails into major colonial transportation routes. The intersection of these trails, which would later become Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street, would soon become the site of The Falls Church.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1733: Original wooden church built</h2>
    <p>The original wooden church, built in 1733, served as a place of worship for settlers and as an outpost of the colonial government. I cannot help but remember that this church was constructed using the labor of enslaved individuals, whose lives were forever altered by the new settlers. The legacy of these enslaved people must be acknowledged as we continue to forge a path toward a more inclusive future.</p>

    <p>In 1769, the current brick church was constructed, designed by architect James Wren. Once again, the labor of enslaved individuals was used to build this structure, which still stands today. As we look upon this historic building, let us not forget the hands that crafted it and the stories of those who toiled in its shadow.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1817: Village of Falls Church grows</h2>
    <p>The village of Falls Church continued to grow, with new residents arriving and contributing to the area's development. However, not all who lived in Falls Church experienced equal opportunities or treatment. As we acknowledge the progress that has been made, it is essential to remember those who were marginalized and excluded throughout our city's history.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1875: Falls Church gains township status</h2>
    <p>In 1875, Falls Church gained township status, and South Falls Church retroceded in 1887. The decision to retrocede was driven in part by the desire for more effective governance and administration of these districts. However, it is essential to recognize that this period also saw the rise of racial segregation and inequality. By understanding and acknowledging the challenges faced by African American residents during this time, we demonstrate our commitment to creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all members of our community.</p>

    <p>In 1948, the City of Falls Church gained independence, further establishing its identity and autonomy in Northern Virginia. As we look back on the growth and development of our city, it is crucial to remember the myriad of experiences that shaped its history. By acknowledging the diverse voices that contributed to the city's progress, we can work together to create a more inclusive and just community that reflects the true essence of our shared heritage.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">2023: Little Falls movement begins</h2>
    <p>The Little Falls movement, which began in 2023, strives to redefine our city's identity in a way that acknowledges our diverse history and embraces an inclusive future. By proposing the renaming of Falls Church to Little Falls, the movement seeks to move beyond the city's ties to a single church and colonial legacy. Instead, it aims to create a more representative and unifying identity that celebrates the area's Indigenous heritage, natural beauty, and the contributions of all the communities that have shaped the city throughout its history. By supporting this change, we commit ourselves to fostering a greater sense of unity and understanding among all members of our community.</p>
