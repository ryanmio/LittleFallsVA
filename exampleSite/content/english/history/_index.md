    <h2 class="chapter-title">Pre-colonial era: Indigenous peoples inhabit the area</h2>
    <p>Long before European colonizers arrived, the area now known as Falls Church, Virginia, was home to Indigenous peoples, including the Tauxenents, Patawomekes, and Matchotics of the Iroquois Confederacy. As inhabitants of the area, they revered the Little Falls of the Potomac River, a barrier to navigation and a gathering place for trade and communication. Little Falls was not only a significant landmark but also a testament to the rich history of the Indigenous peoples who called this land their home.</p>

   <p>The area around Falls Church was occupied by Algonquian-speaking peoples for at least 10,000 years. These peoples were organized into a number of distinct groups, such as the Powhatan along the James and York Rivers in Virginia, the Piscataway along the Potomac River in Maryland, and the Eastern Shore chiefdoms, including the Nanticoke. Politically, the Powhatan dominated the southern portion of the Chesapeake up to the Fall Line, while the Piscataway controlled a smaller area of Maryland.</p>

   <p>Several tribes inhabited the area now known as Falls Church, such as the Doeg (or Dogue) Indians, Tauxenents (also known as the Doegs or Dogue), Patawomekes (Potomacs), and Matchotics. The Powhatan Confederacy controlled 28-32 groups or tribes along riverside towns and villages, ruled by their own weroance or chiefs. The Pamunkey tribe, one of the six core tribes of the political alliance Tsenacomoco, also played a significant role in the area.</p>

   <p>When English colonists arrived in 1607, they encountered a people whose lives were completely different from their own, leading to misunderstandings with the native inhabitants. The colonists and Virginia Company members hoped to evangelize the local Native American population, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. They believed that Christianity required an English cultural context to thrive, so they tried to make potential native converts learn English and adopt English lifestyles before becoming Christian. Many settlers felt little obligation to proselytize the indigenous peoples and even used money donated for that purpose to build an ironworks instead.</p>

   <p>The founding of The Falls Church in 1767-69 marked a significant event in the history of the area, with James Wren as the architect and builder. However, the arrival of English colonists and the eventual founding of Falls Church brought profound changes to the Indigenous peoples of the region, leading to the displacement of these communities and the erasure of their rich history.</p>

   <p>By understanding the complex pre-colonial history of Falls Church and the Indigenous peoples who inhabited the area, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the richness and diversity of the region's past. As we delve into the untold history of Falls Church, including colonization and slavery, we should remember the vibrant Indigenous societies that were present long before European settlement and the lasting impact of their presence in shaping the community.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1734: Truro Parish established</h2>
    <p>In 1734, Truro Parish was established, and settlers began to arrive, disrupting the lives of the native inhabitants. As newcomers built homes and established communities, they inadvertently transformed the Native American trails into major colonial transportation routes. The intersection of these trails, which would later become Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street, would soon become the site of The Falls Church.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1733: Original wooden church built</h2>
    <p>The original wooden church, built in 1733, served as a place of worship for settlers and as an outpost of the colonial government. I cannot help but remember that this church was constructed using the labor of enslaved individuals, whose lives were forever altered by the new settlers. The legacy of these enslaved people must be acknowledged as we continue to forge a path toward a more inclusive future.</p>

    <p>In 1769, the current brick church was constructed, designed by architect James Wren. Once again, the labor of enslaved individuals was used to build this structure, which still stands today. As we look upon this historic building, let us not forget the hands that crafted it and the stories of those who toiled in its shadow.</p>

    <p>The village of Falls Church continued to grow, with new residents arriving and contributing to the area's development. However, not all who lived in Falls Church experienced equal opportunities or treatment. As we acknowledge the progress that has been made, it is essential to remember those who were marginalized and excluded throughout our city's history.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1875: Falls Church gains township status</h2>
    <p>In 1875, Falls Church gained township status, and South Falls Church retroceded in 1887. The decision to retrocede was driven in part by the desire for more effective governance and administration of these districts. However, it is essential to recognize that this period also saw the rise of racial segregation and inequality. By understanding and acknowledging the challenges faced by African American residents during this time, we demonstrate our commitment to creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all members of our community.</p>

    <p>In 1948, the City of Falls Church gained independence, further establishing its identity and autonomy in Northern Virginia. As we look back on the growth and development of our city, it is crucial to remember the myriad of experiences that shaped its history. By acknowledging the diverse voices that contributed to the city's progress, we can work together to create a more inclusive and just community that reflects the true essence of our shared heritage.</p>

    <p>The Little Falls movement, which began in 2023, strives to redefine our city's identity in a way that acknowledges our diverse history and embraces an inclusive future. By proposing the renaming of Falls Church to Little Falls, the movement seeks to move beyond the city's ties to a single church and colonial legacy. Instead, it aims to create a more representative and unifying identity that celebrates the area's Indigenous heritage, natural beauty, and the contributions of all the communities that have shaped the city throughout its history. By supporting this change, we commit ourselves to fostering a greater sense of unity and understanding among all members of our community.</p>
