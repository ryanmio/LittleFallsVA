    <h2 class="chapter-title">Pre-colonial era: Indigenous peoples inhabit the area</h3> </div>
    <p>The area around Falls Church was occupied by Algonquian-speaking peoples for at least 10,000 years. Several tribes inhabited the area now known as Falls Church, such as the Doeg (or Dogue) Indians, Tauxenents (also known as the Doegs or Dogue), Patawomekes (Potomacs), and Matchotics. The Powhatan Confederacy controlled 28-32 groups or tribes along riverside towns and villages, ruled by their own weroance or chiefs. The Pamunkey tribe, one of the six core tribes of the political alliance Tsenacomoco, also played a significant role in the area.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1734: Truro Parish established</h2>
    <p>In 1734, Truro Parish was established, and settlers began to arrive, disrupting the lives of the native inhabitants. As newcomers built homes and established communities, they inadvertently transformed the Native American trails into major colonial transportation routes. The intersection of these trails, which would later become Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street, would soon become the site of The Falls Church, serving as a center for worship and community life. The transformation of Indigenous trails into colonial transportation routes not only facilitated the movement of European settlers but also hastened the disappearance of the region's Indigenous heritage.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1733: Original wooden church built</h2>
    <p>In 1733, the original wooden church was built, serving as a place of worship for settlers and as an outpost of the colonial government. We must not forget that this church was constructed using the labor of enslaved individuals, whose lives were forever altered by the new settlers. Stripped of their freedom and dignity, these individuals were forced to build a place of worship for a community that, in many ways, did not recognize their humanity. The impact of this injustice reverberates through time, shaping the ongoing struggle for racial equity and social justice in our contemporary society.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1769: Current brick church built</h2>
    <p>In 1769, the current brick church was constructed, designed by architect James Wren. Once again, the labor of enslaved individuals was used to build this structure, which still stands today. As we look upon this historic building, let us not forget the hands that crafted it and the stories of those who toiled in its shadow. This enduring structure has borne witness to centuries of history, from the earliest days of the American colonies to the present day. </p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1817: Village of Falls Church grows</h2>
    <p>The village of Falls Church continued to grow throughout the early 19th century, with new residents arriving and contributing to the area's development. However, not all who lived in Falls Church experienced equal opportunities or treatment. Enslaved individuals in Falls Church were subjected to harsh living conditions, forced labor, and the denial of basic human rights. Native American inhabitants of the region also experienced significant changes as the village of Falls Church expanded. Forced to adapt to the influx of new settlers, these communities faced challenges in preserving their traditional ways of life and cultural heritage.

    <h2 class="chapter-title">1875: Falls Church gains township status</h2>
    <p>In 1875, Falls Church gained township status, and South Falls Church retroceded in 1887. The decision to retrocede was driven in part by the desire for more effective governance and administration of these districts. However, it is essential to recognize that this period also saw the rise of racial segregation and inequality. By understanding and acknowledging the challenges faced by African American residents during this time, we demonstrate our commitment to creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all members of our community.</p>

    <p>In 1948, the City of Falls Church gained independence, further establishing its identity and autonomy in Northern Virginia. As we look back on the growth and development of our city, it is crucial to remember the myriad of experiences that shaped its history. By acknowledging the diverse voices that contributed to the city's progress, we can work together to create a more inclusive and just community that reflects the true essence of our shared heritage.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-title">2023: Little Falls movement begins</h2>
    <p>The Little Falls movement, which began in 2023, strives to redefine our city's identity in a way that acknowledges our diverse history and embraces an inclusive future. By proposing the renaming of Falls Church to Little Falls, the movement seeks to move beyond the city's ties to a single church and colonial legacy. Instead, it aims to create a more representative and unifying identity that celebrates the area's Indigenous heritage, natural beauty, and the contributions of all the communities that have shaped the city throughout its history. By supporting this change, we commit ourselves to fostering a greater sense of unity and understanding among all members of our community.</p>
