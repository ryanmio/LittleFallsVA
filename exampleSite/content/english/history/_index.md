      <h3 class="chapter-title">Pre-colonial era: Indigenous peoples inhabit the area</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The area around Falls Church was occupied by Algonquian-speaking peoples for at least 10,000 years. Several tribes, including the Doeg (or Dogue) Indians, Tauxenents, Patawomekes (Potomacs), and Matchotics, lived in the region and established their settlements along the rivers and coastlines, particularly the Potomac River. The Powhatan Confederacy, the most powerful chiefdom in the area, controlled 28-32 groups or tribes that occupied riverside towns and villages, with their influence extending up to the Fall Line, a geological boundary where waterfalls or rapids limited river navigation and marked the transition between the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont Plateau.</p>

<p>The falls of the Potomac River were vital for the tribes, providing sustenance, resources, and a meeting place for trade and cultural exchange. These tribes, including the Pamunkey tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy and the political alliance Tsenacomoco, had rich cultural traditions, with unique customs for marriage, divorce, education, and punishment of wrongdoers. The priests, or kwiocosuk, played a significant role in their society, advising the chiefs on important actions, including war. The First, Second, and Third Anglo-Powhatan Wars, along with treaties between Native Americans and English colonists, impacted the indigenous populations in the Falls Church area, as tribes were forced to cede land and resources.</p>

<p>As European settlers arrived and expanded their settlements, the indigenous tribes in the Falls Church area experienced upheaval and displacement, leading to a decline in their population and paving the way for the transformation of the region.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In 1734, Truro Parish was established, and settlers began to arrive, disrupting the lives of the native inhabitants. As newcomers built homes and established communities, they inadvertently transformed the Native American trails into major colonial transportation routes. The intersection of these trails, which would later become Broad Street, Lee Highway, and Little Falls Street, would soon become the site of The Falls Church, serving as a center for worship and community life. The transformation of Indigenous trails into colonial transportation routes not only facilitated the movement of European settlers but also hastened the disappearance of the region's Indigenous heritage.</p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">The Original Wooden Church and Its Legacy</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In 1733, Mr. Richard Blackburn reached an agreement with the Vestry to build the original wooden church at the Cross Roads near Michael Reagan's. The church, designed to be 40 feet in length, 22 feet wide, and 13 feet pitch, was weatherboarded and covered, with all the inside work meticulously performed. This place of worship served both as a spiritual sanctuary for settlers and an outpost of the colonial government. The construction costs were set at 33,500 pounds of tobacco.</p> 
 <p>While the church played a significant role in the settlers' lives, it is essential to confront the fact that it was built using the labor of enslaved individuals. These people were deprived of their freedom and dignity, forced to erect a place of worship for a community that often failed to recognize their humanity. The legacy of this injustice persists, shaping the ongoing struggle for racial equity and social justice in our contemporary society. In 1757, the name "Falls Church" was first applied to the Upper Church, serving to distinguish it from the Church in Alexandria.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In 1769, the current brick church was constructed, designed by architect James Wren. Once again, the labor of enslaved individuals was used to build this structure, which still stands today. As we look upon this historic building, let us not forget the hands that crafted it and the stories of those who toiled in its shadow. This enduring structure has borne witness to centuries of history, from the earliest days of America to the present day. </p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">The Growth of Falls Church</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The village of Falls Church continued to grow throughout the early 19th century, with new residents arriving and contributing to the area's development. However, not all who lived in Falls Church experienced equal opportunities or treatment. Enslaved individuals in Falls Church were subjected to harsh living conditions, forced labor, and the denial of basic human rights. Native American inhabitants of the region also experienced significant changes as the village of Falls Church expanded. Forced to adapt to the influx of new settlers, these communities faced challenges in preserving their traditional ways of life and cultural heritage.</p> 
        
<p> As the United States descended into the Civil War in the 1860s, Falls Church found itself on the border between the Union and the Confederacy. Due to its strategic location near the nation's capital, the village became a battleground for both sides. Throughout the war, Falls Church changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces, with each occupation leaving its mark on the community. Residents faced the challenges of wartime, including food and supply shortages, as well as the ever-present threat of violence.

      <h3 class="chapter-title">Falls Church Gains Township Status</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Upon gaining township status in 1875, Falls Church experienced an increase in its African American population, with the town boundary initially including the entire Tinner Hill neighborhood and other areas now part of Fairfax County. This demographic shift led to 37 percent of registered voters being Black. In response, the town government in 1887 moved the boundary line northward, deliberately excluding much of the Tinner Hill neighborhood and reducing the number of Black registered voters to just 15 percent of the total population in the township.</p>
   <p>In 1890, the Town Council of Falls Church further voted to cede its other majority African-American districts, including the James Lee community, to Fairfax County. This decision resulted in over one-third of the town's land being relinquished to the county.</p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">Tinner Hill - A Testament to Resistance and Unity
</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In the early 20th century, amidst the struggle for civil rights and the fight against segregation, a small but significant victory took place in Falls Church, Virginia. The Tinner Hill community was developed by Charles Tinner, a Black stone mason, and his wife Mary Elizabeth in the late 1800s. In 1915, his son Joseph Tinner, along with neighbor Dr. E. B. Henderson and others, formed the Colored Citizens Protective League to protest a proposed city segregation ordinance. This ordinance would have forced Black residents to sell their homes and relocate to a designated part of town. The Colored Citizens Protective League later became the first rural branch of the NAACP in 1918.</p>
   <p>The Tinner Hill community's bravery and resilience led to a U.S. Supreme Court victory in 1917, which outlawed forced housing segregation in Buchanan vs. Warley. Today, Tinner Hill is a small park (tucked in between Sislers Stone and Coleman PowerSports) featuring markers, plaques, and a "Zig-Zag" sculpture by local artist Martha Jackson Jarvis. The sculpture symbolizes the political boundaries drawn in 1887 to dilute the voting power of local Black residents by placing them in larger Fairfax County, rendering their votes less influential. The zig-zag is also a West African symbol representing the performance of the unusual or impossible.</p>
   <p>Across the busy Lee Highway, a 14-foot arch made of pink granite stands as a testament to the Tinner Hill families and their work in creating the first rural chapter of the NAACP. The arch, quarried, cut, and masoned by Charles Tinner himself, represents two sides coming together, bending toward each other, and providing each other with greater strength. This symbolism reflects both the unity of different races and the combined strength of Joseph Tinner and E.B. Henderson working together.</p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">The City of Falls Church Gains Independence</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In 1948, the City of Falls Church gained independence, further establishing its identity and autonomy in Northern Virginia. As an independent city, Falls Church had the opportunity to create its governance structure, allowing for increased control over its affairs and better responsiveness to the needs of its residents. This period coincided with social and political changes occurring nationwide, including the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for greater equality and justice for all Americans.
</p>
   <p>Throughout its history, Falls Church has been home to a diverse array of residents from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. These individuals and communities have each contributed in their own way to the growth and development of the city, bringing unique perspectives and experiences that enrich the fabric of our shared heritage.</p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">Addressing the Legacy of Racism</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Falls Church has not been immune to the historical impact of racism and prejudice. Throughout its history, African Americans in Falls Church faced significant obstacles, including the racial segregation in public facilities and schools. In the late 20th century and into the 21st century, efforts were made to acknowledge and address the city's past connections to slavery and segregation.</p>
   <p>After conducting extensive research, the church discovered that skilled, but enslaved laborers had built the Falls Church in 1769. In an effort to honor these individuals and their contributions, a plaque was dedicated in 2017, offering "gratitude and repentance" for the forced labor. The church chose the word "repentance" over "apology," as the latter was deemed not strong enough. Aisha Huertas, the Diocese of Virginia’s intercultural ministries officer, emphasized that this process of repentance is vital for both the church community and broader society. The case of the Falls Church congregation highlights the importance of acknowledging historical injustices and working towards healing and reconciliation.

      <h3 class="chapter-title">The Little Falls Movement Begins</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In 2023, the Little Falls movement emerged, advocating for a redefinition of the city's identity to recognize and embrace its diverse history and envision a more inclusive future. By suggesting a name change from Falls Church to Little Falls, the movement aimed to move beyond the city's connections to the single colonial-era church and its associated legacy. Instead, the movement's goal was to establish a more representative and unifying identity that celebrates the area's Indigenous heritage, natural beauty, and the contributions of various communities that have shaped the city throughout its history.</p>
   <p>The Little Falls movement brought together a diverse coalition of residents, historians, and civic leaders, who actively engaged in conversations about the city's complex past and future.</p>

      <h3 class="chapter-title">The Need for a New Identity</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Falls Church's history, while marked by growth and development, is also deeply entwined with pain, cruelty, and the forced subjugation of the Indigenous and African populations. The church, an embodiment of colonial power, was built on the backs of enslaved individuals and appropriated land. By examining the darker chapters of our history and shedding light on the actions of the church and colonizers, we make a case for a new identity that breaks free from this legacy.</p>
   <p>The settlers who founded Falls Church were quick to impose their beliefs and practices on those who called this land their home, displaying little respect for the Indigenous peoples and their way of life. The church, as an institution, took part in this forced assimilation, often leading to the erasure of native traditions and customs. Moreover, the colonizers showed blatant disregard for human dignity as they enslaved Africans and exploited their labor to build the church and the surrounding community.</p>
   <p>Such a dark history must not be overlooked or brushed aside. It is time for us to confront these cruel acts and hold the church and colonizers accountable for the pain and suffering they caused. By perpetuating beliefs that furthered the interests of the colonial settlers and justified their exploitation, the church played a central role in the oppression of the Indigenous and African populations. This disregard for the well-being of others in the name of a god and belief system that demanded unquestioning obedience is a stain on our city's history.</p>   
    <p>To truly acknowledge and address our dark past, we must first break free from the shackles of a name that honors an institution responsible for such cruelty. By choosing a new identity, we send a powerful message of reckoning, accountability, and a commitment to healing the wounds inflicted by our ancestors.</p>
      <p>Embracing the name Little Falls allows us to connect with our pre-colonial past, paying homage to the Indigenous peoples who first cherished the beauty and wonder of the Potomac River. In doing so, we create an inclusive and unifying identity that acknowledges the diverse voices of our community, both past and present.</p>
      <p>By confronting our history and breaking away from the name Falls Church, we have an opportunity to create a more equitable and compassionate future, where all members of our community are valued and heard. Let us use this new identity as a stepping stone towards collective healing, understanding, and growth.</p>
