As our movement to rename Falls Church to Little Falls continues to grow, we're encouraged by the increasing number of residents who are joining the conversation.

## Community Engagement

Our recent community forums have seen record attendance, with people from all backgrounds sharing their perspectives on what our city's name means to them. While opinions vary, there's a growing consensus that a name representing our entire community—rather than just one religious institution—would better reflect our values of inclusivity and diversity.

## Historical Context

Local historians have been instrumental in helping residents understand the deeper historical context of both names. Many residents were surprised to learn that the area was known for its proximity to the Little Falls of the Potomac long before the establishment of The Falls Church in 1732.

## Looking Forward

As we move forward, the Little Falls Movement remains committed to respectful dialogue and community education. We believe that by understanding our shared history and listening to diverse perspectives, we can work together toward a name that honors our past while embracing our future.
